1
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,846
Forget it.

2
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,915
Forget that you're told to
never smile until you die.

3
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,323
I THINK THIS IS VERY WELL-WRITTEN.

4
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,761
I'll do my best to come up with jokes.

5
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,230
We want to see you smile.

6
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,533
I found a pretty stone, big sis!

7
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,535
It looks pretty.

8
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,003
-Let's find more.
-Okay.

9
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,944
I found your stone, Mita.

10
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,014
Please...

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,483
be our mommy.

12
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,119
As you wish.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,921
What?

14
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,891
Mita really said that?

15
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,960
You should propose to Mita, Daddy!

16
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,830
Wait a minute...

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,265
I can't do that!

18
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,935
Why not? Do you hate Mita?

19
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,737
That's not it, but...

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,372
I was surprised, too.

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,874
I never expected that
she'd agree to be our mom.

22
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,810
But isn't this for the best?

23
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,845
Mita will be with us forever now.

24
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,681
-But still--
-I have returned.

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,249
-Welcome home!
-Welcome home.

26
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,151
I will prepare dinner now.

27
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,955
Come on! Hurry up and propose.

28
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,223
Give me a break.

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,991
Please, Daddy!

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,232
Excuse me, Mita.

31
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,037
What is it?

32
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,876
Will you really be their mother?

33
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,579
If you don't mind, that is.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,614
Wait.

35
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,816
But you know...

36
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,821
I was just thinking
what our relationship will become.

37
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,593
We're not going to become
a married couple, are we?

38
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,104
I've already signed and
placed my seal here.

39
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,005
What?

40
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,440
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

41
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,975
AKARI MITA

42
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,810
Wait a minute...

43
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,246
Hold on. I can't do that.

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,048
Why not?

45
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:33,286
I mean, I'm the man
who made their mother commit suicide!

46
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,990
Ms. Asuda did not kill herself.
It was an accident.

47
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,526
Oh. You're right, but...

48
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,898
Besides, you have just started working
at your new company,

49
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,566
so your salary is lesser

50
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,936
and should not be financially capable of
hiring a housekeeper.

51
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,505
If I become a housewife,

52
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,008
it will reduce your financial burden

53
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,045
and I will be able to take care of
the children for the whole day.

54
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,414
I believe this is the best solution.

55
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,683
She's right, Dad!

56
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,886
Now you can focus on work
without worrying about us!

57
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,221
I'll quit cram school

58
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,423
and let Mita tutor me.

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,860
Please, Daddy! I don't want Mita
to be gone anymore!

60
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,929
One moment.

61
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,630
Hey, Yui...

62
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,833
Do something about this, will you?

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,237
For now, just say that you'll take
your time to think about the marriage.

64
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,307
Mita can stay with us anyway.

65
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,542
Isn't it fine, Dad?

66
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,047
Oh... Well, I guess you're right.

67
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,788
Mita.

68
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,894
Could you do that for us?

69
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,064
As you wish.

70
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,000
All right!

71
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,768
Mita.

72
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:57,971
Here you go.

73
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,373
Put your stone in here.

74
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,246
As you wish.

75
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,087
Then you don't need this stone now.

76
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,189
What? But that's Mommy.

77
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:21,794
You do not need two mothers in this house.

78
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,333
Everyone...

79
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm in your care from now on.

80
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,758
-Yui!
-Yes?

81
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,861
Have you told Santa
what you want for Christmas?

82
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,564
-Oh, I'm still thinking about it.
-What?

83
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,199
Dinner is ready.

84
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,235
-Okay.
-All right!

85
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,736
-Hurry up and sit.
-I'm so hungry.

86
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,905
Huh? What's this?

87
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,008
The food's really plain,
compared to usual.

88
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,178
Our financial circumstances
aren't doing that well,

89
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,713
so we will have to save on food.

90
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,983
But wait. Dad's serving looks way better.

91
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,619
Your father is raising you guys,

92
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,620
so it's a given.

93
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,491
Also, all of you can only eat
two servings from now on.

94
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,695
No way! That's not enough for me!

95
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,797
You don't have to do that, Mita...

96
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,434
I'm just saying that
you do not have much savings left,

97
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,837
and you still have to pay off
the loan for this house.

98
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,506
I believe that the kids
should understand your circumstances.

99
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,208
Okay.

100
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,980
Well... I guess we should just eat first.

101
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,383
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

102
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,619
Right. Do you know
how to solve this question, Mita?

103
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,523
Hey. What are you...

104
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,858
From now on,

105
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,828
you will not be allowed to
look at your phone while eating.

106
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,464
What? But my entrance exams
are coming soon.

107
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,999
If you can't solve a question
as simple as that,

108
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,802
I think you should give up on
entering an private school.

109
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,504
It will help with our finances.

110
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,439
Hey, what is "family finances"?

111
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,175
You will be in elementary school
next year,

112
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,512
so stop acting spoiled
and don't talk when you eat.

113
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,749
Hey. You didn't have to be that harsh...

114
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,784
You're the eldest child,

115
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,754
so you should help out with
the household chores

116
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,389
if you have time to complain.

117
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,791
-But Mita...
-Mom.

118
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,292
What?

119
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm not Mita. Call me "Mom."

120
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,068
Please stop treating me like
I'm your housekeeper.

121
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,776
Hey. What do you think, Dad?

122
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,044
Don't you think she's acting weird?

123
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,379
Why don't you say something?

124
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,481
Oh... Okay.

125
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,085
Well, you're right.

126
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,562
Mita. I...

127
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,469
Huh? Wait, my stomach...

128
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,304
-Dad?
-Dad!

129
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,039
-Hey!
-Are you all right?

130
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,541
It hurts...

131
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,243
Let's call an ambulance!

132
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,114
Dad! Are you all right? What's going on?

133
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,055
You have stomach ulcers,

134
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,991
and will need to be hospitalized
for a week.

135
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,627
But how did this happen?

136
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,831
Weren't you feeling fine
just a while ago, Dad?

137
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,432
Well, yes.

138
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:52,405
Please have a good rest.
I will oversee everything at home.

139
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,648
Ms. Asuda?

140
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,152
His father-in-law is here to visit him.

141
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,086
Mita.

142
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,322
I'm sorry,

143
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,992
but could you not tell my father-in-law
that you became their mother?

144
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,795
I'll tell him properly another time.

145
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,630
As you wish.

146
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,134
Hey. Are you all right?

147
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,871
Oh... I'm sorry you had to come
all the way here, Father-in-law.

148
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,706
Don't worry about it.

149
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,709
I wanted to talk to you about something.

150
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,210
What's the matter, Grandpa?

151
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,179
Well, actually...

152
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,082
It's about Urara.

153
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,785
She said she's going to marry the guy
she met on the blind date.

154
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,690
She even decided on the wedding
ceremony date without asking me.

155
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,792
What? So sudden?

156
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,862
That fool asked me to
keep it a secret from you guys,

157
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,299
and I raised my voice at her unknowingly.

158
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,334
What will you do, Father-in-law?

159
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,939
Maybe I'm just imagining things...

160
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,642
But I think that...

161
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,847
Urara's trying to give up on you.

162
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,684
Actually...

163
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,988
Urara told me something the other day.

164
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,356
I...

165
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,259
I like you.

166
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,399
Sorry, but I'll never hand Urara
over to you.

167
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,200
Oh, of course.

168
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,338
I don't expect myself to
marry someone else again, either.

169
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,740
So...

170
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,612
I just have no idea what I should do.

171
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,852
Shall I try to convince Ms. Urara?

172
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,157
Really?

173
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,426
That's great!

174
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,729
Maybe you might be able to do something!

175
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,632
I'm counting on you, as it were!

176
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,200
As you wish.

177
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,004
We also have a few dresses
which you can change into.

178
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,817
What's the matter, Mita?

179
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,887
Are you really planning to get married?

180
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,860
Yes. He is a really wonderful person.

181
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,563
He doesn't mind that I'm a complete klutz,

182
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,565
and it felt as if
I've met my destined pair.

183
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,103
But you don't look really happy about it.

184
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,408
I... I decided to
stop smiling like a fool.

185
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,711
Just like you, Mita.

186
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,815
He's getting transferred to New York
for his work,

187
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:54,453
so I think we'll really never meet again.

188
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,723
Please take care of Yui and the kids.

189
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:04,397
Don't worry. I became their mother.

190
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,498
What?

191
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,634
No way...

192
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,538
Then...

193
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,607
Are you going to marry Keiichi, Mita?

194
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,643
Is there a problem with it?

195
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,112
No, not really.

196
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,914
If you're around,

197
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,783
there's nothing to worry about.

198
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,319
Please...

199
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,354
be happy.

200
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:39,432
<i>After climbing up this slope</i>

201
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,035
Sing with me, Mita.

202
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,671
You should call me "Mom."

203
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,373
Oh... Sorry.

204
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,009
<i>After climbing up</i>

205
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,080
Forget the song that
you sang with your dead mom.

206
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,481
What?

207
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,419
I'm home.

208
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,890
What were you out doing so late?

209
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,893
Oh, sorry. My laptop broke down,

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,528
so I asked my friend to fix it.

211
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:13,632
Hurry up and have dinner,
or I can't clean up.

212
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,212
-What's wrong, Kaito?
-I stepped on a cockroach!

213
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,547
I also left my phone in school.
I can't believe this.

214
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,815
What?

215
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,919
And what's your problem?

216
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,788
I tried to give up my seat
for an old lady on the train,

217
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,623
and she stomped her
walking stick on my foot!

218
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,924
I ran off trying to endure the pain,

219
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,693
and I fell off the stairs
and fractured my ankle!

220
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,495
Just what are you doing?

221
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,400
-What's wrong Kii?
-There's an insect in my milk!

222
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,307
Just what's going on with everyone?

223
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,376
You're all acting like Urara now.

224
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,286
Thanks.

225
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,722
Stop playing around.

226
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,491
Kakeru and Kaito, hurry up and study.

227
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,060
You need to bathe too, Kii.

228
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,831
-Okay.
-Got it.

229
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,438
Hey. You met Urara today, didn't you?

230
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,940
How did it go?

231
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,110
She looked really happy.

232
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,712
Her partner seems like
a really nice person.

233
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,482
Then will Urara get married?

234
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,983
Actually, why didn't you stop her?

235
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,119
It can't be helped.

236
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,621
It's something Ms. Urara decided
for herself.

237
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,157
Forget about that.

238
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,526
You should hurry up and eat.

239
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,732
Tell me. What are you thinking?

240
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,870
What do you mean?

241
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,608
You agreed to be our mom
because you have something in mind, right?

242
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:08,113
I am simply doing
what any mother would do.

243
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,482
As the housewife of a family,

244
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,885
it is tough to educate the children,

245
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,588
and think about the household finances.

246
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,625
I went along with your selfish whims
when I was still your housekeeper,

247
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,896
but you should understand I can no longer
do that once I become your mother.

248
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,368
She really said that?

249
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,136
But you know...

250
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,873
I just can't accept it.

251
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,412
Why did Mita
suddenly change so drastically?

252
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,414
What does "drastically" mean?

253
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,318
Doesn't it feel like Mita became
a completely different person, Kii?

254
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,020
That reminds me.

255
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,823
Strange things have been
happening recently.

256
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,361
Did Dad get hospitalized because
she put something inside his food?

257
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,964
Is she after Dad's insurance money?

258
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,834
Wait, maybe she came to our family
in the first place

259
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,736
to take over the household.

260
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:08,007
Stop it, both of you! Say something, Yui.

261
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,044
Why are you guys...

262
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,681
sitting around here and talking in secret?

263
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,551
Oh, no. It's nothing. Right?

264
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,486
Yeah.

265
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,788
Hurry up and go home.

266
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,491
I need everyone to help me with something.

267
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,565
We will do spring cleaning now,

268
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,901
so I will throw away
everything that's not needed.

269
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,670
First...

270
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,105
We start with this.

271
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,540
What?

272
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,377
Kakeru and Kaito,
the two of you will throw it away.

273
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,981
-There's no way we can do that!
-Right! It's Mom's altar.

274
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,817
I am your mother.

275
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,522
Kii.

276
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,992
Throw this away, too.

277
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,327
No!

278
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,295
We don't want that, either.

279
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,732
Stop it! Why are you
saying such things, Mita?

280
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,000
If you won't do it,

281
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,469
you don't need to stay in this house.

282
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,104
Get out.

283
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,206
What?

284
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:22,314
If you won't listen to your mom,
get out of this house.

285
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,722
Everyone...

286
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,291
Let's go.

287
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,260
Come with me, Kii.

288
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,804
Mita really said that?

289
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,775
We can't take it anymore.

290
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,010
Please, Dad.

291
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,545
At this rate,
our family's going to get messed up!

292
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,317
Okay.

293
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,419
Then let's call your grandfather.

294
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,454
Wait, I can't.

295
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,590
What? Why?

296
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,227
Urara's getting married tomorrow,
so he won't have time for this.

297
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,512
Say, Urara...

298
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,016
Are you really fine with this?

299
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,584
Dad...

300
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,223
Thank you for
everything you've done for me.

301
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,661
Just what are you saying, as it were?

302
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,131
It's almost time to enter the hall.

303
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,045
Wait!

304
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,684
What's wrong, everyone?

305
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,519
Sorry to bother you
at a time like this, Urara.

306
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,256
The moment Mita became our mom,

307
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,259
she's been really mean to us!

308
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,227
What did you say?

309
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,330
The home got depressing,
and we stopped smiling.

310
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,399
We tried hard to think about
what we can do,

311
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,869
but we just have no idea what to do!

312
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,907
And then, I was reminded of you, Urara.

313
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,444
You always come visit us,
and whenever we talked about our problems

314
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,047
you would always say,
"I'll do something about it!"

315
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,415
I just kept thinking of it!

316
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,522
<i>The bride is now entering the hall.</i>

317
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,065
What?

318
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,738
I'm truly sorry about this!

319
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,748
Hey! What are you doing, Mita?

320
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,153
You guys wouldn't listen,
so I'm trying to burn this.

321
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:19,291
Hey! Stop this!

322
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,926
Why are you here?

323
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,362
You were supposed to get married today.

324
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,131
I heard that
you were being mean to the kids!

325
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,733
What are you talking about?

326
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,237
In the first place, you said
you would never come to this house again.

327
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,173
That's...

328
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,411
What are you guys thinking about,
bringing someone like her here?

329
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,780
As punishment, you will have no dinner.

330
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,917
Also, let's just cancel
the Christmas party.

331
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,685
Wait...

332
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,755
Why are you doing this, Mita?

333
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,827
An outsider should not interfere in
our family matters.

334
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,564
Stop saying such mean things!

335
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,066
Urara came because she's worried about us!

336
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,367
What are you saying?

337
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,205
You guys were the ones
who said that nothing good ever happens

338
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,240
when Ms. Urara comes.

339
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,876
Chase her out right now,

340
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,811
and never let her in again.

341
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,446
There's no way we can do that!

342
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,783
Urara came over even though
it's her wedding ceremony!

343
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,052
I've been thinking about it.

344
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,488
Bad things have been
happening to us lately

345
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,292
because Urara stopped coming over.

346
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,061
I realized it, too.

347
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,231
Urara always pulled the old maid
and stuff,

348
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,835
because she was warding off
all the bad luck and disaster for us!

349
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,207
I don't like it that
I can never see Urara again!

350
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,275
Then...

351
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,877
Me...

352
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,513
Or that woman.

353
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,983
Choose either one of us.

354
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:57,322
Who do you prefer having to protect you,

355
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,927
and who is the one you really need?

356
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,835
Wait a minute. I didn't come here to...

357
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,837
Please keep quiet.

358
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,673
This is...

359
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,077
something the children should decide

360
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,192
We can't decide one or the other.

361
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,697
What should we do, Yui?

362
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,640
I...

363
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,812
No matter what happens to us,

364
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,783
Urara always cherishes us.

365
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,087
I believe that she will never betray us.

366
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,157
So...

367
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,164
Urara...

368
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,334
I want you to be with us forever.

369
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,073
Yui...

370
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,448
You...

371
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,852
You are not our mother.

372
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,026
I understand.

373
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,764
If so, I will leave the house.

374
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,967
Wait, Mita!

375
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,469
There's no point stopping me.

376
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,340
This is something you have decided.

377
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,663
Could it be that Mita...

378
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,836
Urara?

379
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,277
-Call Dad.
-Got it.

380
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,016
Mita!

381
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,752
Mita!

382
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,257
Mita. You did all that on purpose, right?

383
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,625
You did all that

384
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,827
so that Yui and the kids
will tell you to get out, right?

385
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,996
Is it because you think
you'll become happy

386
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,965
if you continue to stay with them?

387
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,303
So happy that you think
you'll start to smile?

388
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:04,676
Then isn't that all right?

389
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:08,046
Yui and the kids need you
more than someone like me--

390
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,484
Hey, what are you--

391
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,552
Stop that!

392
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,089
If you don't stop, I'm going to get mad!

393
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,025
Hey, what--

394
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,526
Stop--

395
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:22,994
Hey--

396
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,001
Don't mess with me!

397
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,904
Hey!

398
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,806
Just what's wrong with you?

399
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,843
Hey! What are the two of you doing?

400
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,214
Please get angry, just like that.

401
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,648
What?

402
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,619
Please cry when you feel like crying.

403
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,157
Please stop trying to be considerate,

404
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,293
and force yourself to smile.

405
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,196
Please stop trying to please others,

406
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,900
or do things just to make others happy.

407
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,672
If you want to become their family,
that is.

408
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,022
If you really wish to
protect that family, that is.

409
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,229
But I...

410
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:32,864
You...

411
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,668
You might not be able to
become Mr. Asuda's wife.

412
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,540
You might not be able to become
the children's mother.

413
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,645
But you can become their guardian.

414
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,816
"I will do something about it."

415
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,554
"I hope you can grow to love
instead of hating one another."

416
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,591
"It will be fine. Just tell him
how you really feel."

417
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,829
All the things you have said are correct.

418
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,802
However, you only conveyed them
the wrong way.

419
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,075
From now on, don't just be nice to them.

420
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,911
Please be harsh on them, too.

421
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,751
Please keep pulling the old maid
like you always have

422
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:32,791
and deflect all the misfortunes
that may befall the family.

423
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,561
And...

424
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,266
One last thing.

425
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:47,505
Please embrace everyone
with that smile of yours.

426
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,246
You must never...

427
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:00,085
become someone like me.

428
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,893
I got it.

429
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,831
I...

430
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,736
I will always live on...

431
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,773
without forgetting my smile.

432
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,389
Please excuse me.

433
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,395
Wait, Mita!

434
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,169
Could we have a proper farewell?

435
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,771
We don't want you to leave like this.

436
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:01,112
Right. It's Christmas eve tomorrow,

437
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,116
so could you at least
stay with the kids until then?

438
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,386
Please!

439
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,391
Mita...

440
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,062
I'm asking you, too.

441
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,443
As you wish.

442
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,287
How did it go, Urara?

443
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,523
We cancelled the ceremony
on the day itself, so there's no refunds.

444
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,592
I see...

445
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,595
Then I'll pay you.

446
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,765
The kids caused you trouble,
and I need to take responsibility.

447
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,634
You really shouldn't
worry about it, Keiichi!

448
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,705
I finally realized why I fell for a man
that I shouldn't have fallen for.

449
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,842
I like Yui and the kids.

450
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,511
I want to be with them, and I don't want
to sever our relationship!

451
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,281
Oh... I see.

452
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,649
Thanks, Urara.

453
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,954
He's here.

454
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,629
Excuse me.
I'm really sorry about yesterday!

455
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,499
I was throwing a fit because I didn't want
to marry someone I don't love.

456
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,201
It was too disrespectful to you.

457
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,205
It's fine. I feel the same way, too.

458
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,874
What?

459
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,011
Actually, there's someone
I'm going out with.

460
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,846
She couldn't go against her father.

461
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,882
She's marrying a man
that she met on a blind date.

462
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,552
It didn't sit right with me, either.

463
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,055
I see! That's why you didn't mind me!

464
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,157
But...

465
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,526
After I saw what you've done...

466
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,428
I've plucked up my courage.

467
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,198
I'm going to see her now.

468
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,132
What?

469
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,471
Stop this ceremony right now!

470
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,806
Sorry!

471
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,507
Who the hell are you?

472
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,412
No way!

473
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,614
Let's go!

474
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,350
Hold up!

475
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,592
Natori?

476
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,593
Chief...

477
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,664
Then that was the director's daughter?

478
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,868
Wait for me!

479
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,241
It looks so tasty!

480
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,411
-Wow! Apfelstrude?
-All right.

481
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,613
-Let's go, it's chilly.
-Tickle, tickle...

482
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,249
Tickle, tickle...

483
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,885
What are you doing?

484
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,754
I was wondering
if you were going to smile.

485
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,592
I've never seen you smile before, Mita.

486
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,395
Oh, right!

487
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:08,399
Dad. Don't you think we should ask Santa
to give Mita a present, too?

488
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:12,103
Oh, you're right! What do you want, Mita?

489
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,139
I don't need anything.

490
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,943
Don't say that.

491
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,647
Right. When is your birthday, Mita?

492
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,583
It's December 25.

493
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,752
-What?
-No way!

494
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,821
Then we definitely should
get something for you!

495
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,223
What? Won't Santa give her a present?

496
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,157
Please have one.

497
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,860
-Well...
-That's...

498
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,228
Please have one.

499
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,764
Kazama.

500
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,567
What are you doing here?

501
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,236
I thought you went back
to the countryside.

502
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,373
I told my parents
the reason I quit the company,

503
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,841
and we got into a fight.

504
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,210
So I came back here again.

505
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,280
I see...

506
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,619
I'm sure this must be karma.

507
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,723
Since I did something that
made your wife commit suicide.

508
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,893
Mom did not kill herself!

509
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:10,662
It's an accident.

510
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,930
What?

511
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,531
No matter what the others say,

512
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,634
this is the truth that we have decided on.

513
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,338
So, please stop blaming yourself.

514
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,113
For you.

515
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,562
Mr. Asuda.

516
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,632
What?

517
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,969
MOVING SERVICE

518
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,574
Excuse me.

519
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,110
What happened?

520
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,482
I asked my husband to
give me back Tsubasa,

521
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,684
but it didn't work.

522
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,722
Just how am I supposed to live
from now on?

523
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,060
You can't give up.

524
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:23,668
Even a scumbag of a father like me
was able to take back my kids.

525
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,610
Tsubasa's mother can only be you
in this entire world.

526
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,317
It's impossible.
Not unless a miracle happens.

527
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,219
What's a "miracle"?

528
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,122
What? Well...

529
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,457
That's...

530
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,163
A miracle refers to something where

531
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,134
you wish for something that
usually never happens to occur.

532
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,503
It is something that happens when
you have a strong willpower.

533
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,506
It is called a miracle,
simply because they do happen.

534
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,910
It will never happen to someone
who has already given up on hope.

535
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,583
Mommy!

536
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,525
I'm sorry, Tsubasa.

537
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,563
No matter what happens,

538
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,132
I'll make sure that
we can live together again.

539
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,901
Really?

540
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,803
It's a promise.

541
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,122
-It's so beautiful.
-Yes.

542
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,558
There's a lot of stars, too.

543
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,728
Dad. Is that the Polaris?

544
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,697
Right.

545
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,433
What is a "Polaris"?

546
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,804
What? Well... How do I explain it?

547
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,373
The Polaris is...

548
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,742
a star that always shines
at the same location,

549
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,045
so when you are lost,

550
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,448
you can find your way
just by looking at it.

551
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,584
It is an important wayfinder.

552
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,519
What's a "wayfinder"?

553
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,789
You can ask Mita about that later.

554
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,358
Right, Mita?

555
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,170
Dinner is ready.

556
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,644
Wow.

557
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,181
It looks even more extravagant today!

558
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,316
You're really good at this, Mita!

559
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,154
Yui helped me out today, too.

560
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,655
Really?

561
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,490
Is that true, Yui?

562
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,226
Well, yes. Hurry up and eat.

563
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,030
You have to join us today, Mita.

564
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,833
That's fine, right Mita?

565
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,841
As you wish.

566
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,543
All right!

567
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:28,686
Here you go.

568
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,255
Here you go.

569
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,291
Here you go.

570
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,228
Done.

571
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,166
I'm so hungry that I'm going to die!

572
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,539
Jeez, Kakeru...

573
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,942
Were you that hungry?

574
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,611
-That wasn't me!
-What?

575
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,279
Wasn't it you, Dad?

576
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,682
No! What are you saying?

577
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,984
-Then who was it?
-It wasn't me.

578
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,552
I'm sorry.

579
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,054
That was me.

580
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,455
No way!

581
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,892
Mita!

582
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,833
Well, I guess we should dig in first.

583
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,368
Okay. Thank you for the food!

584
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,437
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

585
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,809
Oh, right.

586
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,145
We really want to
give you a present, Mita.

587
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,547
Is there anything you want?

588
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,918
Doesn't Santa give us presents instead?

589
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,856
Well, it's because
Mita's birthday is tomorrow.

590
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,691
It's a birthday present.

591
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,827
Can you think of anything, Mita?

592
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,430
We've thought about it, but we just
don't know what you would like.

593
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,102
I just want one thing.

594
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:52,770
What?

595
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,872
What is it?

596
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,709
Kii.

597
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,880
Could you give me my stone?

598
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,814
What?

599
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,527
No!

600
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,499
Hey, Kii.

601
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,702
I...

602
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,706
I really don't want Mita to go!

603
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,856
Don't cry, Kii.

604
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,393
Come on. You can't cry, Kii.

605
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,662
Mita.

606
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,167
Could you please stay with us,
at least for Kii?

607
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,468
If you're worried that we can't afford it,

608
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,171
I'll go work part-time or something!

609
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,341
I'm sorry...

610
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:10,147
but Ms. Harumi has set up
a new housekeeping agency in Okinawa,

611
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,750
and I will be departing tomorrow.

612
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,418
-What?
-What?

613
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,753
No way.

614
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,756
We still haven't seen you smile, Mita.

615
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:25,262
Thanks to you, I had the courage
to continue living.

616
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,666
I wanted to repay you
for everything you've done!

617
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,405
Your thought is more than enough.

618
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,875
Thanks to everyone,

619
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:43,748
I found light in my life, even though
it's just a small glimmer of it.

620
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,151
However...

621
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:52,690
My feelings towards
my late husband and son

622
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,193
will never disappear.

623
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:05,770
I have no choice but to bear the sin of
letting the both of them die.

624
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,643
But from now on...

625
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:21,218
I found light in my life,
thanks to everyone.

626
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:30,227
I would like to rely on that faint light
and continue working as a housekeeper.

627
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,931
With my own will.

628
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,541
I understand.

629
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,712
If you insist on quitting...

630
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,818
Then I have one last order for you.

631
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,554
Mita.

632
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,891
What is it?

633
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,094
Please smile.

634
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,234
Right now...

635
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:15,272
you might think that you shouldn't smile
because of your late husband and son.

636
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:20,878
But do you think
that's what they would have wanted?

637
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,316
You're still alive.

638
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,920
You can still feel hunger, like just now.

639
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,790
You also can feel the cold.

640
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,159
Your finger bled when you cut yourself.

641
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,361
You got mad at the kids.

642
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,597
You cried at the amusement park.

643
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,903
You're not a robot, but a human! So...

644
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,442
For our sake... No.

645
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,513
For your late husband and son...

646
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,114
I want you to smile for their sake.

647
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,888
How could you leave
without letting us see you smile?

648
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,590
It's cowardly!

649
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,293
I won't accept it!

650
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,900
Please smile, Mita.

651
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,515
Please smile, Mita.

652
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,460
As you wish.

653
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,252
Mita.

654
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,587
Promise me.

655
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,127
No matter which family you go to
from now on,

656
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,564
you must always act on your own will.

657
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,600
As you wish.

658
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:01,772
Don't you ever promise that
you'll do anything they ask,

659
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,173
and try anything dangerous

660
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,075
like what you did here, okay?

661
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,711
As you wish.

662
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,481
I...

663
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,817
If I ever feel like eating your cooking,

664
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,422
can I go visit you?

665
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,926
As you wish.

666
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,496
If...

667
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:30,167
If I enter a private school
and make lots of friends,

668
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,340
you have to celebrate it for me, okay?

669
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,045
As you wish.

670
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,716
I'm going to become strong.

671
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:50,688
I'll become a strong person
who will protect everyone!

672
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,559
So you have to come see us again, okay?

673
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,762
As you wish.

674
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,269
All of us cannot be thankful enough
for what you did for us.

675
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,806
You saved all of us, Mita.

676
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,042
So if you're ever in trouble,

677
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,645
you can rely on us, okay?

678
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,614
As you wish.

679
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,285
If...

680
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,855
If you ever call me,

681
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,159
I'll be the first to be there for you,
no matter what it may be.

682
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,765
As you wish.

683
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,369
If you come across a difficult question,

684
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,207
I'll definitely solve it for you!

685
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,844
As you wish.

686
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,851
Mita.

687
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,922
Thank you for everything.

688
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:06,697
Thanks to you,
I was able to get back my family.

689
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,272
Please stop blaming yourself anymore.

690
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,511
This time, it's your turn to become happy.

691
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:28,652
If you don't become happy,
I won't forgive you.

692
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,791
As you wish.

693
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,461
From now on...

694
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:43,667
You have to laugh lots and lots, okay?

695
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,970
Mita.

696
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,841
As you wish.

697
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,584
Let's eat, okay?

698
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,887
You too, Mita.

699
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,063
HARUMI HOUSEKEEPING AGENCY
WE HAVE RELOCATED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

700
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,799
Sorry about this, Akari.

701
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,902
You had to help me out with all these.

702
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,504
No problem.

703
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:24,474
Oh, isn't it almost time?

704
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,744
You promised to
say goodbye to them, right?

705
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,313
Hurry up.

706
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,114
Thank you.

707
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,187
What is it?

708
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,723
Akari...

709
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,260
Could you...

710
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,562
do that for me, too?

711
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,866
What are you referring to?

712
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,035
Could you smile for me?

713
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,640
Never mind.

714
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:02,646
I'll wait for the day
you can smile naturally.

715
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,917
But still, Akari...

716
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,619
You...

717
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:14,291
I'm just so happy for you.

718
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,629
I'm so happy for you.

719
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,411
<i>After climbing up</i>

720
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,449
<i>This slope</i>

721
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,055
<i>There's a tree</i>

722
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,459

BUS STOP

727
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:21,658
I'm sorry. Kii was the one who suggested
we have our final farewell here.

728
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:26,096
She said that she's sick,
but I'm sure she's just feigning it.

729
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,098
Right?

730
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,333
Yeah.

731
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,102
Oh, it's here.

732
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:50,520
Oh, my! I'm really sorry about this,
everyone.

733
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:56,526
It's all because I suddenly decided to
relocate to Okinawa.

734
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:01,965
Oh, by the way. This isn't an aloha shirt,
but a <i>kariyushi </i>shirt.

735
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,569
Okay. Let's go, Akari.

736
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,007
Please excuse me.

737
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,993
Maybe Mita was Santa Claus.

738
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,463
Huh? What are you talking about?

739
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,101
I mean, her birthday's on December 25.

740
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,938
Her name "Mita"
could also be read as "Santa."

741
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,373
What?

742
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,978
San... ta?

743
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,181
No way...

744
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:58,688
Akari. Are you really fine with this?

745
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,260
I'm just relocating the shop
into the city,

746
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:07,964
since that building was getting old.

747
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,700
It's fine.

748
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,936
Mita!

749
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,774
Mita!

750
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,110
Mita!

751
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,313
Mita!

752
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,049
Mita!

753
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,752
Mita!

754
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,055
Mita!

755
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,493
What's going on?

756
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,162
My stomach hurts! Hey!

757
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:43,133
Please stop, driver! Stop!

758
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:56,546
You can drive off now, driver!
I feel better!

759
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,832
Here you go.

760
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,355
Thank you very much.

761
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:45,061
There is something
I would like to give you too.

762
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:05,115
"I LOVE YOU, KII."

763
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,073
You should let go now, Kii.

764
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,249
Okay.

765
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,961
Thank you for everything.

766
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,846
Everyone, I called Grandpa over
for a sukiyaki party today!

767
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,882
All right!

768
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,253
Kii. Could you teach me
the song Mommy sang?

769
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:24,721
Sure.

770
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,756
<i>When you turn at the tree</i>

771
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,858

772
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,694

00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,571
That's our Polaris.

776
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,606
Yes.

777
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,708
No matter what happens,

778
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,576
we just need to look at
where it is and come home.

779
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,012
Hey, everyone!

780
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:52,382
I bought some great beef, as it were!

781
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,985
All right! Great beef!

782
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,054
-Let's go!
-All right, as it were!

783
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,272
I am here on behalf of
Harumi Housekeeping Agency.

784
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,542
I'm Mita, your housekeeper.

785
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,012
THE END

786
