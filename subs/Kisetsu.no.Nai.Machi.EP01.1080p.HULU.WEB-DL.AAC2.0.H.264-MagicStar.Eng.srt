He was caught on this dashcam.

330
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,877
[cop 3] He's carrying the girl
on his back.

331
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,382
-What time was that?
-What time?

332
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,927
[cop 1] Around 8 or 9 a. m.

333
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,223
[resident 4] This morning at eight,

334
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,564
I heard Roku-chan's train. Right, Mitsuyo?

335
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:42,905
That's right. His "clickety-clack"
wakes up my husband every morning.

336
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,032
Like an alarm clock.

337
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,036
But he's on this dashcam.

338
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,792
He passed me by
at 9 a. m. near the water faucets.

339
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,255
I saw him, too,
doing his "dodo-sukosukosuko."

340
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,465
No, it's "dodes'kaden."

341
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,598
So obviously, you've got the wrong guy.

342
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,768
But this dashcam shows...

343
00:19:57,852 --> 00:20:02,653
Who are you gonna believe?
Some dashcam or my pal here?

344
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:04,448
The dashcam.

345
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,784
Why, you!

346
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,834
[resident 5] Tanba-san, what good timing.
You saw Roku-chan today, right?

347
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,047
You bet I did.
We played shogi at my place.

348
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:13,508
Right, Roku-chan?

349
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,096
[Tanba-san] It was a good game.

350
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,353
Your cat was there, too, so ask him.

351
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:21,858
You live here, too?

352
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,987
Huh?

353
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,618
So, did you see him?
I bet you didn't, did you?

354
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,375
Uh, just a sec.

Can you hold this?

[Hansuke] The 7:28 a. m. train
passed by my place at 7:40 a. m.

358
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:48,620
Then it looped back at 8:10 a. m.

359
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,710
Then it looped back at 8:40 a. m.
and again at 9:10 a. m.

360
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,839
It looped my place every 30 minutes.

361
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:55,759
Then after an hour's lunch break,

362
00:20:55,843 --> 00:21:00,644
the afternoon train departed at 1:12 p. m.
southbound and 1:50 p. m. northbound.

and spent the night here last night.

That man gave me a ride to the station.

I'm sorry, Mom.

See? I told you he was on the dashcam!

Let's get us a drink, Hatsu.

Yeah! I'm coming!

380
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,207
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.

381
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,961
[Roku-chan] Sorry about that.

382
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:58,802
[Kuniko] I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about that.

383
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,848
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

-[resident 8] Are they gone?

[resident 8] That was close.

387
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:15,669
Did they ask about me?

388
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:17,756
Did they?

389
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:22,182
You sure as hell
better not have told them anything!

390
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:33,287
Thank you, Mr. Train Driver.

391
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:45,812
I just went along with everyone.

392
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,816
Thank you so much. I mean it.

Don't thank this guy!

394

Roku-chan!

395
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,707
Keep an eye on him from now on, too.

396
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,339
Keep an eye on Roku-chan, please.

397
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:02,680
Sorry about Tora.

I'm indebted to people again.

400

Okay, now it's time
for the Young Men's Club

401
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,000
to welcome Hansuke to the Club.

Where are you going, Katsuko? The bath?

Aren't you cold? You'll catch a chill.

406
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,230
You've lost weight again.

Are you getting enough food and sleep?

Have this fried chicken stick. It's good.

Enjoy the bath. Take it easy.

Is the Young Men's Club just you two?

No. With you, it's three.

Hold on. What is this club supposed to do?

423
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,548
This is temporary housing.
We're all gonna move out sometime.

424

The government's stopping funding, too.

Why don't we tell him your plan, Tatsuya?

426
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:33,485
We, of the Young Men's Club,
will build a cafe here!

00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:36,868
A cafe?

Seriously? Do you need a cafe here?
Would any of these people use it?

430
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:47,430
Not really a cafe, but a salon.
A hangout spot for young people.

A cafe? A salon?

Something besides our everyday stuff.

A place where people naturally gather
and laugh and cry together.
