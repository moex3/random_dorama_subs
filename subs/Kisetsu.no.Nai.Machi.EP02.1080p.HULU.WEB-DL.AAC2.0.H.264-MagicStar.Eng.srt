1
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:04,050
[Hansuke] I email reports
to my employer, Mikki,

2
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:07,223
about everything I hear
and see in this town.

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,728
Then he pays me a maximum of 10,000 yen.

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:11,899
At least that was the plan.

5
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:13,986
[delivery man] Is Mr. Tanaka in?

6
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:17,702
[delivery man grunts]

7
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:19,706
Delivery from Mr. Mikimoto.

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,671
Oh, sorry.

9
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:25,050
[muttering]

10
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:30,185
A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,818
If I paid you 10,000 yen each time,
I'd go broke, moron.

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,408
[Hansuke] At least send me food
I can eat raw. I can't cook.

13
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,913
Enough whining.
Give me gritty human drama.

14
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:42,209
The gritty life in temporary housing.

15
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:50,017
EPISODE 2
FOR MOTHER

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,185
[Tanba-san] That's useless.

17
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:53,649
I've moved my knight.

18
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,193
Oh, right.

19
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,615
Then…

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,370
-[Tatsuya sucks teeth]
-[piece clanks]

21
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:02,876
-The bishop can get you.
-Oh, right.

22
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:04,921
Then…

23
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,925
-[piece clanks]
-The rook can get you.

24
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:10,975
[clattering]

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,814
[playful music]

26
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,530
[object clattering]

27
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:19,033
Tanaka here.

28
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:20,870
From building three.

29
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:24,961
Would you like one of these?

30
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:30,222
Good timing. Take over for me.
I've got a doctor's appointment.

31
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:32,017
But I don't play shogi.

32
00:01:32,602 --> 00:01:34,438
My darn brother came back.

33
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,111
Long time no see, Tatsuya.

34
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,618
Before The What, he lived with us.
We were a family of four.

35
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:43,916
[Tatsuya sighs]

36
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,551
We were happiest then.

37
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:52,057
Dad died in The What.

38
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:53,393
[Tatsuya sniffles]

39
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,733
There was nobody we could turn to.

40
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,029
We had no choice but to come here.

41
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:03,204
[Tatsuya] Akio of the Young Men's Club
was a really great guy.

42
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:05,083
Mrs. Yoda. Mrs. Yoda.

43
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,505
Don't just stand there.

44
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,049
You must be hungry.

45
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:10,678
I'll show you around.

46
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,389
Come on. Let's go.

47
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:14,185
-[Akio] Let's go.
-[Mrs. Yoda] Thank you.

48
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,189
[Akio] Everyone!

49
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:20,071
This is Mrs. Yoda.
She's moved into building five.

50
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:21,742
Nice to meet you.

51
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,664
-[all] Nice to meet you.
-Okay, let's get you in line.

52
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:28,254
[Tatsuya] Ultimately, my brother
didn't fit in here and ran away.

53
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,467
Mom ended up marrying Akio.

54
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,058
-They soon had a daughter.
-Let's go, Akane.

55
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:37,105
-[Tatsuya] But Akio…
-See you later.

56
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,401
-See you later.
-…treated me nice and cared about me.

57
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:40,487
[Tatsuya chuckles]

58
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,867
He was like a real dad.

59
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,542
You should try to get
into college, Tatsuya.

60
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,213
-I'd never get in.
-Why?

61
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:54,014
Mom's pregnant again and we can't live
in temporary housing forever.

62
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:57,689
But that's no reason
to put your own future on hold.

63
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,820
Dad…

64
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:04,451
I'll work my tail off,
so don't put your future on hold.

65
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:05,538
Check.

66
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,752
-[Roku-chan] Dodes'ka-den. Dodes'ka-den.
-Oh! Whoa.

67
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,340
Let's get you a suit.

68
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,344
-What?
-You'll look great in one.

69
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:14,430
-Let's go.
-[gasps]

70
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:17,144
We'll get you one
for your entrance ceremony.

71
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:18,229
-Really?
-Yeah.

72
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:20,651
He actually had a suit made for me.

73
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,657
We were happiest then.

74
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,410
THEY WERE HAPPIEST THEN

75
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,665
[Hansuke] Happiness isn't any good.

76
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,001
-Huh?
-Hm?

77
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,882
[Tatsuya] Mom had a baby boy,

78
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,844
and I had entrance exams.

79
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,810
Akio worked day and night
so he wasn't home often.

80
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:42,820
That's when my brother, Shingo, showed up.

81
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,743
[upbeat music]

82
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:51,630
He looked like
a parody of a debt collector.

83
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,594
My sister was so scared,
she didn't stop crying.

84
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,182
-But Mom…
-[Mrs. Yoda] Shingo?

85
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:58,894
Mom.

86
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,608
[Mrs. Yoda] Shingo.

87
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:05,407
Sorry. I've put you through so much.

88
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:09,039
[Shingo's friends] Nice to meet you.

89
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,417
My…

90
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,381
[Tatsuya] We had sukiyaki that night.

91
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,093
I didn't eat any,

92
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:17,389
but Mom was in high spirits.

93
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,898
Tatsuya and Akane,
come on in and have some.

94
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:26,407
It won't be long before you can get out
of this rundown place,

95
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,537
and we can all live together.
Right, Tatsuya?

96
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,754
Thank you. You're so kind, Shingo.
[chuckles]

97
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,843
Me and these guys, we'll start a company.

98
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,389
-An IT-related company.
-Really?

99
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:40,644
-[friend 1] We'll work hard.
-[friend 2] You can count on us.

100
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:43,024
[Mrs. Yoda] Congratulations!
I think I'll drink tonight.

101
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,151
[all cheer]

102
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,948
[Tatsuya] The next morning,
when I woke up…

103
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:51,833
[baby babbles]

104
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,893
-[Tatsuya] What are you doing?
-Morning.

105
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,064
-Sorry it's not in an envelope…
-Thanks.

106
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,901
Take care of Mom, Tatsuya.

107
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:07,573
Hold on! That's my suit.

108
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,453
And that's the money for my college.
Give that back!

109
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:11,790
[Tatsuya panting]

110
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:13,585
Got a problem with it?

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,006
[Mrs. Yoda] Tatsuya.

112
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,489
-[Shingo] Yo.
-[friend 3] You look great in that, man.

113
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:29,868
[Tatsuya] That's when…

114
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:33,249
I don't know how to say this.

115
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,293
[inhales deeply]

116
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:40,305
I lost sight of what my life had been for

117
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,102
and what I was living for.

118
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:46,358
I was…

119
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:52,037
-In despair?
-Yeah, despair. Despair.

120
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,458
-Sorry.
-Huh?

121
00:05:54,542 --> 00:06:00,011
Things were tougher for you,
so I shouldn't complain.

122
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:03,852
It's been tough for everyone.

123
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:07,860
You can't go around
comparing who's worse off.

124
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,158
Yeah, I guess you're right.

125
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:12,244
[chuckles]

126
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,208
-Then?
-Uh…

127
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,924
I gave up on college and got a job.

128
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,680
But that bothered Akio,

129
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,560
and he worked even harder.

130
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,067
[Tatsuya] One day,
he coughed up blood and collapsed.

131
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,992
Mom was pretty desperate then.

132
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:37,043
She went to Akio's co-workers
and borrowed money from them.

133
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:39,464
The other residents raised money too.

134
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,849
-Everyone else helped make this.
-Thank you.

135
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,978
I know things are rough. Here, have this.

136
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:47,188
[gasps]

137
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:51,196
[Tatsuya] I got an advance on my pay
and worked night shifts.

138
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,994
We eventually got
two million yen together.

139
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,496
I swear I'll pay you back.

140
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,714
[Tatsuya] But the whole time,
my brother kept pestering Mom for money.

141
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,801
[tense music]

142
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,934
-Sorry it's not in an envelope…
-It's okay.

143
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,813
-Are you eating?
-Yeah.

144
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:10,611
-Are you sleeping?
-Yes, I am.

145
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,573
Are you getting a good bath, too?

146
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,326
Yes, I am.
[Shingo chuckles]

147
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,209
It cost 400,000 yen
for the operation and hospitalization.

148
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:23,469
When Akio asked for the money
that was left over, Mom just…

149
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,736
I lent the rest to my son.

150
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:38,249
[Tatsuya] The look on Akio's face then,

151
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,754
I'll never forget it.

152
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,342
He wasn't angry.

153
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,514
He wasn't sad.

154
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,522
It was like he was seeing someone
he'd never met before.

155
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:55,993
Instead of criticizing Mom,

156
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,374
Akio stopped talking to her…

157
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,840
and eventually left her.

158
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:08,225
That finally got Mom's attention.

159
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:11,649
Now she works days at a supermarket
and nights as a janitor.

160

320
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,878
[mellow music]

321
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,139
[people clamoring]

322
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:07,892
[Mrs. Yoda] Tatsuya?

323
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,311
I need your bicycle.

324
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,773
[panting]

325
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,067
Tatsuya?

326
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,658
[Mrs. Yoda whimpering]

327
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,167
Darn it!

328
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,720
Darn it!

329
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:33,861
[panting]

330
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,825
[doctor] He's in shock from bleeding.

331
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:38,787
It went in his back through his liver.

332
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:43,672
But he told you
my name and address, right?

333
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,217
[doctor] No.

334
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,431
He was in a comatose state
when he was brought in.

335
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,395
Huh?

336
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,409
[doctor] Those are his things.

337
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,998
TATSUYA YODA
MITSUBA BANK

338
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:02,251
[Tatsuya] I get it now.

339
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:07,887
This is how the police knew
what my name and address were.

340
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:10,016
Shingo!

341
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,273
[doctor] Ma'am, you shouldn't see this.

342
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:16,655
Tatsuya…

343
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,953
-Mom.
-[Mrs. Yoda] Wake up.

344
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,836
Shingo, it's your mother.

345
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,338
Wake up.

346
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:26,758
Mom.

347
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,473
My savings account bankbook is here.

348
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:34,481
Why…

349
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:37,905
did Shingo have it?

350
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,874
I know this isn't the time for this.

351
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,632
[Mrs. Yoda] You're so mean.

352
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,305
Huh?

353
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,691
I gave your bankbook to Shingo!

354
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,496
Why bring this up now?

355
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:05,460
I can't help it. I'm his mother.

356
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:09,009
You never listen to him and just leave.

357
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,305
He said he'd get his act together.

358
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,351
He said needed money to do that.

359
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:16,065
-I couldn't ignore him.
-Maybe we should talk outside.

360
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,071
[Mrs. Yoda] But you were secretly
saving up money.

361
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:24,498
I've seen you open up that bankbook
at night and grin at it a hundred times.

362
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,337
But when Shingo's in trouble,
you won't help.

363
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,928
Your savings
is more important than family.

364
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:36,105
[Hansuke] "You're wrong, Mom."

365
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,194
Tatsuya silently pleaded with her.

366
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:42,618
-[monitor beeping]
-[nurse] BP is falling.

367
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,831
[doctor] Get back, ma'am.

368
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,545
-Raise the vasopressor to 10 cc.
-[nurse] Okay.

369
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:50,551
Thank God your bankbook wasn't hurt!

370
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:56,855
Even with your brother in this condition,
you're just happy your bankbook is okay!

371
00:18:56,938 --> 00:19:01,071
-[doctor] Give him norepinephrine.
-You're so cold and cruel!

372
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:03,827
Shingo!

373
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:05,246
[Hansuke] "You're wrong!

374
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:07,752
I wasn't saving money just for me.

375
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:12,010
It was to move our family
to someplace better.

376
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,972
In fact, I reconsidered.

377
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:16,937
I came back home
to give Shingo this money.

378
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,816
That's the truth. Believe me!"

379
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,032
Shingo was always kind.

380
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,334
He always cared for his mother,
not like you.

381
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,386
He was always considerate
to me, and said, "You cut your hair,"

382
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:37,770
and "You must be tired. Don't overdo it."

383
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,651
But did you ever say that? No, never!

384
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:43,866
When you were saving that money,

385
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:49,752
did you ever think of your mother,
of Shingo, of Akane, or Ryu?

386
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:51,171
No, I bet you didn't.

387
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,177
You only thought of yourself.

388
00:19:54,762 --> 00:20:00,189
When I said, "I'm tired,"
you'd selfishly answer, "I'm tired, too."

389
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:02,987
That doesn't help!

390
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:06,452
That's not what I want to hear!

391
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:09,291
-[nurse] BP still falling.
-[doctor] Give him a transfusion.

392
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,418
[nurse] Okay.

393
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,882
[Mrs. Yoda] Please, listen to me Shingo.

394
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,009
[sobbing]

395
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:17,057
Shingo, no. Don't die.

396
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,396
-Don't you dare die, Shingo!
-[nurse] Pulse is infrequent.

397
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,735
-[doctor] Give him a shot of atropine.
-[nurse] Okay.

398
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,365
[Mrs. Yoda murmuring and sobbing]

399
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,452
Oh, that's right.

400
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:30,751
[Okabe] Tatsuya?

401
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:34,383
[sighs]

402
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,265
When the knight moved…

403
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,650
When the knight moved,
that's when I blew it.

404
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,537
I should have moved
the silver general back to 4-8,

405
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:53,922
and then I should have attacked
with the knight.

406
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:57,470
-[Okabe] Shogi?
-Now I get it.

407
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,224
[sobbing]

408
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,648
Darn it.

409
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,192
[sighs heavily]

410
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:06,865
Now I get it.

411
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,242
[breathes heavily]

412
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,889
[Hansuke] Let's see. If I go like this…

413
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:22,020
-Then like this…
-[Tanba-san] You can't jump like that.

414
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,149
-This isn't a racing game.
-[Hansuke] Then here.

415
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:27,573
[Tanba-san] Besides, you left the board.
Don't be so stupid.

416
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:34,629
What was the point of that story
about the landlord Kobe?

417
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:39,054
I'm not sure what the point was.

418
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:44,356
[Hansuke] It seems to me
that what he's doing only hurts him.

419
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:49,074
He complains out of kindness,
but nobody pays him any attention.

420
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:52,330
[Tanba-san] That's his character.

421
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,419
He'll eventually realize

422
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,764
that the world still revolves
whether he's around or not.

423
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,400
Welcome home, Tatsuya. Where's Mom?

424
00:22:07,235 --> 00:22:10,158
-She'll stay at the hospital tonight.
-Really?

425
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:12,955
Welcome home.

426
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,627
What're you up to?

427
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:20,721
I searched for ways
to get rid of tons of napa cabbage.

428
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:26,398
-[Okabe] Here we go!
-Wow!

429
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,237
It shrunk. This'll be easy.

430
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,993
You're too optimistic.
Look how much is left.

431
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,120
[Tatsuya] We can do it!

432
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:34,999
-There's no way.
-Yes, we can.

433
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:36,794
-No way.
-If we all eat it, we can.

434
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,548
-We can eat it!
-There's no way!

435
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:39,675
Let's eat!

436
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:42,973
-[keyboard clacking]
-[Hansuke] Four days later,

437
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:47,566
Tatsuya's brother woke up.

438
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,991
He didn't die,
but since he didn't have insurance,

439
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:55,456
they'll use Tatsuya's savings
to pay for his treatment.

440
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,168
[laughter]

441
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:02,095
[Hansuke] His brother will come around
asking for money in the future,

442
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:05,351
and his mother will probably dote on him.

443
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:10,779
Nobody listens to Tatsuya's complaints.

444
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,586
-[Okabe] Here.
-But it's not midnight yet.

445
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,674
It's okay. They won't sell, anyway.

446
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,330
-Thank you. Bye.
-[Okabe] Bye.

447
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:45,891
Hansuke.

448
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:52,153
Again?

449
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,288
Delivery from Mr. Mikimoto.

[shouting]

451
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:03,718
It's fresh.

452
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,893
[Tora] Meow! I'm Hansuke's cat, Tora.

453
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,441
Hansuke thinks that he owns me,

454
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:14,740
but I'm the one who owns him.

455
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:17,955
Episode three is "Hansuke and Tora."
To me, it's "Tora and Hansuke."
