CAPTAIN: KYUSUKE TANAKA

00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:06,179
[Hansuke] I've been here a month.

3
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:11,774
I make money by submitting reports
about the lives of the residents.

Dodes'ka-den. Dodes'ka-den.
[mimics train honking]

00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:17,493
[Hansuke] The first time,
I was paid 10,000 yen.

6
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:20,123
-I thought this would be a breeze.
-Dodes'ka-den. Dodes'ka-den.

EPISODE 3
HANSUKE AND THE CAT

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,641
But it didn't continue.

11
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,227
I had nothing to write.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,897
I could only write lies.

[camera shutter clicks]

15
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:42,209
[Hansuke] Is Hatsutaro actually
Shuzo Matsuoka's brother?

16
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,673
Tanba-san, you've got rice on your back.

17
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:46,217
-Get it off.
-[camera shutter clicks]

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,432
[Hansuke] Does Tanba-san have
a shogi board tattoo on his back?

19
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,269
MESSAGE SENT

20
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:54,860
But this is what I get paid.

21
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,295
Things are getting bad, Tora.

22
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,592
You can live this way,
but I can't survive on cucumbers!

23
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,556
[Tora] Why not write about yourself?

24
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:11,059
[soft chuckle]

25
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:14,482
I couldn't do that. That's so conceited.

26
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,406
[Tora] It's good enough
for one episode of a third-rate drama.

27

[Hansuke sucks teeth]

[collar bell jingling]

29
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,554
Sorry.

30
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:32,017
[Hansuke] When I open my laptop,

31
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,355
-that's the sign for Tora to leave.
-[collar bell jingling]

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,365
It's like he's saying, "I don't want
to interfere in master's work."

33
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,494
He's so well-behaved.

[lively music]

36
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,563
He's fat and tubby,

37
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:57,484
and his head's big and round,
like a soccer ball.

38
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:02,161
Wherever Tora goes,
he struts around like he's the boss.

39
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,962
He's completely different
when he's outside than when he's at home.

40
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:11,680
His territory grows every day.

41
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,811
He grew it all through his own effort.

00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:35,143
Hey! Hansuke's thieving cat.

49
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,609
You're on the tracks. Get off!

50
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,822
[Hansuke] Maybe he does it out of spite.

51
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:45,038
But it's more like he's daring you
to try something with him.

52
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,877
You're hopeless.

53
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:52,261
[Roku-chan mimics train chugging]

54
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:57,104
[Hansuke] He's always taking life head-on,
and powering through it and winning.

00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:00,235
-That's how Tora lives life.

And Tora has a weakness for fried foods.

00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,225
His recent favorite is the ham cutlet roll
at Wanpaku Delica.

[screaming in delight]

00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,489

Reporting about Tora won't do me any good.

[Roku-chan mimics train chugging

63
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,759
[Okabe] Sorry.
Things have gotten stricter lately.

64
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,844
Mm-mm.

65
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,182
[Okabe] All the boxed lunches
and sandwiches we toss out

66
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,353
have to be recorded and reported.

67
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,108
Thank you. That's a big help.

68
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:45,910
How's work? Going well?
What are you writing about now?

69
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:51,713
I actually read a lot myself,
like Risa Wataya.

70
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,184
[Hansuke slurping]

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,425
Today, the radio said
that since the temperatures are mild,

72
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,262
it'll be a nice day.

73
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:19,393
-Pollen levels are high too.
-Hmm.

74
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,451
That's right.

75
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:28,787
[Okabe] Hmm?

76
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,000
The boat banner, right?

77
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,881
It's the same as the one outside.

78
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:38,557
That's why
you suddenly got all awkward, right?

79
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:43,191
I'm not being awkward. Am I?
[awkward chuckle]

80
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:48,952
[Hansuke]
My family was an offshore fishermen.

81
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:53,754
Dad, Grandpa and my brother
were washed away on the boat in the thing.

82
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:58,639
But their boat banner
must have been found somewhere.

83
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,976
Do you mean The What?

84
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,356
The What or whatever it is.

85
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,195
Seeing it made me really happy.

86
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,788
That banner was
a symbol of the Tanaka family.

87
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,875
[somber music]

88
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:15,756
And only you survived?

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,842
Mm.

[wind gusting]

92
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:32,874
[Hansuke] You feeling better now?

93
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,880
[Tatsuya] No, I'm not.
That's why I'm drinking.

94
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,096
I've finally learned.

95
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:45,608
To a parent, the bad kid is more adorable.

96
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:50,366
You're drinking
to get your mom to worry about you?

97
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:54,208
Then this place is a real bargain.

98
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,838
Man-to-man discount stew, 90 yen.

99
00:05:57,297 --> 00:05:59,092
"Man-to-man discount"?

100
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,138
The stew's only 90 yen?

101
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,311
[Masuo] Better not ask what's in the stew.

102
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,570
[Hatsutaro] Have you watered this down
so we can't even tell it's shochu?

105
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,538
That's called "oyuwari."

106
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:18,674
[Hatsutaro] Oh, my mistake.
No wonder you graduated from high school.

107
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:22,598
[Masuo] Hey, kid.
If you need money, we'll get you a job.

108
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,395
-It's manual labor.
-Seriously?

109
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,317
[Masuo] Seriously. If you've got a seal
and have gloves,

110
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,781
you'll get paid 10,000 a day.

111
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,077
Don't do it, Hansuke.

112
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,417
You can't do physical labor.

113
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:38,462
You'll just get hurt.

114
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,095
Assemble scaffolding.

115
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:45,393
Tear down scaffolding
and assemble it again.

116
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:50,863
It's scaffolding hell
of eternal assembling and tearing down.

117
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:57,626
If you need ideas for a novel,
I'll think of some.

118
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:02,469
What about that homeless father and son?

119
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,972
Homeless?

120
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:13,700
[Okabe] Here.

121
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:29,064
Sorry, but I can't give you bread
or boxed lunches anymore.

122
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:33,532
Hold on a sec.

123

[quirky music]

124
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:47,308
[son]
Maybe I will travel to Miyashita Ginza.

125
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,318
[father] I cannot allow you
to travel that far all alone.

126
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,447
I'll be fine.

127
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,661
Several restaurants there provide food.

128
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,919
It's almost their closing time,
so you go on home.

129
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,259
Are you sure?

130
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,808
If you insist, then I'll let you go.

131
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:30,729
Mostly, the boy gathers food for them.

132
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:34,444
He may not look it, but the father

133
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:37,033
is apparently
a privileged university grad...

[Hansuke]
I decided to call him "Rich Man."

138
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,865
They don't have to live there.
There are empty prefabs here.

139
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:20,954
They should move in.
It's rent-free, after all.

140
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,672
You can live here if you lost your home,

141
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:29,346
but you can't
if you didn't have a home to begin with.

It's the same as always.

Everything that humans do
is so dull and superficial.

Oh?

There's no need to cook it for him.

163
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,007
There's leftovers he can have.

164
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:53,013
When a cat gets like that,

165
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,769
they're bigger connoisseurs
than most people.

166

-[sniffing]
-Such a refined oil flavor and aroma.

175
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:45,744
This is miles better
from the fried food at Roku-chan's place.

176
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,290
The breading is crisp
and the inside is tender.

177

[Hansuke] He could have scared him off
by attacking with his claws.

183
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,897
But the serious determination
in the boy's eyes said

184
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,151
he wouldn't be scared off.

You may have the mushrooms,

but please allow me to have
the two pieces of shrimp.

I bought it!

[Hansuke] Look, Tora.
It's the kind that reduces carbohydrates.

What's wrong, Tora?
Has your stomach shrunk?

You silly cat.

It sure is.

00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:18,121
I wonder who reported them.

It wasn't me.

I may not look it, but I'm compassionate.

-[resident 1] Huh?
-[resident 2] I wouldn't be so sure.

240
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:29,351
-[resident 3] He says he's compassionate.
-[resident 4] Not the way I see it.

241
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,419
[Mikki] What's wrong? I paid you.

242
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,048
[Hansuke over phone] That sure was a lot.

243

You did good work.

244
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,515
That's what I want more of.

245
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:55,445
Mikki, did you send me here
to be like some kind of spy?

246
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,533
[Mikki over phone] What if I did?

247
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,788
I knew it.

248
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,378
I wish you'd told me from the start.

249
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,382
[Mikki] Then you wouldn't have done it.

250
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:11,018
I totally would have. In fact,
it would have been easier if I'd known.

Besides, why me?

No family ties.

it only affects your cat.

00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:36,862

00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:48,927
[Mikki] I'll tell you more later.

[Hansuke] Since his rival was gone,
Tora became even more brazen.

272
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,174
He was in the heyday of his life.

273
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:32,682
Eventually, he went into heat.

[Tanba-san inhales sharply]
It's no fun playing for nothing.

Let's wager something.

00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:11,300
Let's see.

282
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:15,391
How about if the loser reveals a secret?

283
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:17,187
Okay.

00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,653
-[Tanba-san] Hmm...
-[bottle cap clicks]

285
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,169
Tanba-san, what's your occupation?

286
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,589
I'm an influencer.

287
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,641
Just kidding. I'm a cabinet maker.

288
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,605
What's an "influencer"?

289
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,736
You don't need to know, Tanba-san.

290
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,832
[Tanba-san] What about you?

291
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,671
You always been a writer?

292
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,554
Actually...
[inhales deeply]

293
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,225
...I'm not sure what I should write.

294
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,739
I didn't want to be a fisherman.

295
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,201
I defied my parents,

296
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,665
and while I was in Tokyo
for entrance exams,

297
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,168
my home got wiped out.

298
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,090
So I didn't have to become a fisherman.

299
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,476
[Hansuke] If I'd been a fisherman,
I'd have died too.

300
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:22,150
So, I survived,

301
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:27,369
but everything I write sounds so fake.

302
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:30,083
Are you listening?

303
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,460
[Tanba-san] Yeah.

304
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:35,009
When people hear this,
they usually say, "That was really rough."

305
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:38,976
You're not the only one who had it rough.

306
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,694
And it's not in the past.

307
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:46,866
Things are rough even now.

308
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:51,125
-That's for sure.
-Hmm...

309
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,087
You're absolutely right.

310
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:57,137
You know,
people are always trying to pigeonhole us.

311
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,936
"It was 12 years ago,
and we need to learn from the tragedy."

312
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,313
I get all that.

313
00:21:02,397 --> 00:21:04,777
But that's not what we're living for.

314
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,698
Not for the past or for learning.

315
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:08,785
We can't be satisfied with their pity.

316
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,956
-Things are always rough!
-[grunts]

317
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,918
[in raised voice]
We can't start over unless we get out!

318
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,091
Their pity becomes meaningless over time.

319
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,887
It's always rough for everyone.

can't take care of the homeless.

321
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:23,105
It's your turn now!

322
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:25,986
-I give up.
-[in normal voice] No, I'm sorry.

323
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,326
I wasn't saying it to you, Tanba-san.

324
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,377
I'll be honest with you.

325
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,090
Actually, I'm--

326
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:37,258
[Tanba-san] Done.

327
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,137
Done?

328
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:42,477
Oh, well. Come with me.

329
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,151
-I'll show you my secret.
-What? Really?

330
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:47,863
I won?

331
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:57,465
[Tanba-san] It's in here.

332
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:01,473
Promise you won't tell anyone.

333
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,271
-[Hansuke] Eh? Eh...
-[keys jangling]

334
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:05,941
[Hansuke] What's in there?

335
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:09,489
Wait.

336
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,090
[Tanba-san] I saw them
picking up empty cans in the rain.

337
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:20,846
Thank goodness.

338
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:24,144
You're alive. Rich Man's alive.

339
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:26,733
I'll tell the council president.

340
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,697
I'd appreciate it
if you told the Young Men's Club.

341
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,908
No problem.

342
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:33,078
Are you hungry?

343
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:36,460
[uplifting music]

344
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:41,261

-[Tora meows]
-Welcome home, Tora.

346
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:48,652
[Hansuke] Look. Tanba-san gave me this.

347
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:50,989
You can have rice and bonito flakes.

348
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,554
[chuckling]

349
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:05,519
[Hansuke] That's so good!

350
00:23:18,294 --> 00:23:19,547
[Masuo] Hey, kid.

351
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,888
[laughter]

352
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:26,059
-[Tatsuya] That's so not you.
-[chuckling]

353
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,771
-Got your seal?
-[Hansuke] Yeah.

354
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:28,940
Get in.

355
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,612
Ooh!
[laughs]

356
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:34,535
Watch after Hansuke.

357
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:36,831
[Hatsutaro] What are you? His parents?

358
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:39,628
Let's meet
under the boat banner at 6:00 p. m.

359
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:41,214
If I make it back alive.

360
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,010
[Tatsuya and Okabe laugh]

361
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,473
[Tatsuya] See ya later!

362
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,559
[Okabe laughs]

363

[cell phone chimes, vibrates]

364
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,042
ANYTHING INTERESTING HAPPEN?

365
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,712
NOPE

366
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:03,635
[indistinct chatter]

367
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:08,352
[Masuo] Hatsu and I have been pals
for 12 years now.

368
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:11,901
-Oh.
-All of Japan knows what The What was.

369
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,905
Pop idols used to come pay their respects.

370
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,241
-Those were the days, right?
-Oh.

371
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,036
[Masuo]
Episode four is "The Bucolic Life."

-You'll like it. Right, Hatsu?
-Oh.
