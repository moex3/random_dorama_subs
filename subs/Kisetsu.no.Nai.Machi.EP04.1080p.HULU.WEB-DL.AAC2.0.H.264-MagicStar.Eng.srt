1
00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:04,383
What a nice day it is, Hansuke.

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:05,595
Are you listening?

3
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:10,437
[Hansuke] I started doing day labor
at a job that Masuo got me.

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:14,529
After work, we drink cheap beer
at Okabe's convenience store.

5
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,409
I can't drink. I've got work tonight.

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:19,163
Darn that Yoshie.

7
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:21,251
She's being crabby again.

8
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,461
What's she say?

9
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,261
I can't read it. You read it.

10
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:32,398
The neighbors are gonna complain,
so could you guys keep it down?

11
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,404
I think it says, "Come straight home."

12
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:38,159
Fine, I will!
I'll go home after this last one.

13
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:40,038
[Hansuke] That wasn't his last one.

14
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:43,461
Setsuko Karasuma is the greatest!

15
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:49,850
Setsuko Karasuma in 1980 was
the greatest seductress in human history.

16
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,187
-Seductress?
-I should really be going.

17
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:53,816
What's the damage?

18
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,778
-1,800 yen.
-That's expensive!

19
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:56,905
Don't worry.

20
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,951
-I'll cover it.
-No, you won't.

21
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,830
I can't let you do that.

22
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,376
What's wrong? Did you lose it?

23
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:05,213
-A pickpocket!
-I was robbed!

24
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,009
Let's look for it.

25
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,180
Where'd you put it after you bought beer?

26
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:13,564
I found it.

27
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:17,864
That's your name, Masuo.

28
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:20,369
Oh, this is yours, Hatsu.

29
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:22,289
[both laugh]

30
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,377
Oh!

31
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:26,715
What's wrong now?

32
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:30,765
This is missing. Where'd mine go?

33
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:32,267
-A pickpocket!
-I was robbed!

34
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:35,107
Look for it. You haven't even tried.

35
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,570
Let's see. I'll call you.

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,160
What happened to your phone?

37
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:45,586
[groaning]

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,968
You come straight home
without spending your pay!

39
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:52,976
Fine! Every day, it's the same.
Ketta-kusowarui shrew.

40
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:54,896
Hatsu!

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,482
Coming!

42
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,904
-Morning.
-Morning.

43
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:02,035
I'll lock the door at 8 p. m.

44
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,791
Cut that out!
Don't be so disgraceful in front of Masuo.

45
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,879
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

46
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:08,757
[both laugh]

47
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,680
[Masuo's wife] What time did yours
come home last night?

48
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,766
-After 1:00 a. m.
-No way!

49
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,226
Sorry for the racket.

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,646
Same here.

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,569
Men are so stupid.
Why do they go out drinking?

52
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:21,449
Yeah, especially
with such hot wives waiting at home.

53
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,619
EPISODE 4
THE BUCOLIC LIFE

54
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:27,879
Why do wives always gotta put
their husbands in a bad mood?

55
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:30,217
You say that stuff nowadays,

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,722
you'll get criticized
for gender discrimination.

57
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,183
You mean SDCheese?

58
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,312
You're so smart, Hatsu.

59
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:38,776
How about a drink at Man-to-Man tonight?

60
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,155
Sorry, today's a no-liquor day.

61
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,159
-Good morning.
-Hi, Hansuke.

62
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:46,917
Listen. If I try to have
a drink today, say this,

63
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,008
"You can't, Hatsu.
Today's a no-liquor day."

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,889
-You said that yesterday.
-Who cares?

65
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,187
I'm going home sober today,
no matter what!

66
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:09,169
[both singing]

67
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,590
MAN-TO-MAN

68
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:13,721
[singing continues]

69
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:14,973
Thank you.

70
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,532
This is Hansuke.

71
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,788
You know him, right? He's Tora's owner.

72
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:29,753
I'm sorry I kept
your husband out drinking.

73
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:31,590
I can see right through you.

74
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:36,182
Did you think I'd forgive you
if you brought home a young man?

75
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:39,063
-[banging on door]
-[Masuo] It's me, Hatsu! Open up!

76
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:41,233
-It's open!
-[door slides open]

77
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:45,618
-[thuds]
-[indistinct chatter]

78
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,454
What's the matter, Masuo?

79
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,751
It's all ketta-kusowarui, that's what.

80
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,965
My old lady's such a hag.

81
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,511
Did you fight with Mitsuyo?

82
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,596
Yup.

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,391
[Hatsutaro laughs]

84
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:58,811
We had a tussle.

85
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,146
[Yoshie] Really?

86
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,900
-Yoshie.
-Yeah?

87
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:06,743
I got a question.
Are fried eggs a breakfast dish

88
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,246
or a dinner dish?

89
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,708
That's ridiculous.

90
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:14,341
When I got home,
I was dying to have fried eggs.

91
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,720
You ever felt that way?

92
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:17,389
-Never.
-I have.

93
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,769
-Sometimes I have.
-Never.

94
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:22,232
You know what my hag of a wife said?

95
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:26,783
"I don't wanna make
breakfast food at night!"

96
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,286
She didn't!

97
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:35,091
So I told her, "Then what about
a fried egg on a hamburger steak?"

98
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:38,347
She said, "That's dinner food."

99
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:42,899
But I don't want no dang hamburger steak.

100
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:43,984
I get you.

101
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:47,240
I only craved hamburger steak until I was
in my second year of high school.

102
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,495
You're always right, Masuo.

103
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,958
-I wouldn't be so sure.
-What?

104
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,879
-[thumps]
-[Masuo] I tried to see it her way.

105
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:58,931
I said if she put a sausage with the eggs,
then I might eat it.

106
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,183
[oil sizzling]

107
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,565
Then she said, "That's breakfast food!"

108
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:04,692
[Hatsutaro chuckles]

109
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,280
You were arguing in circles.

110
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,619
But I stuck to my guns.

111
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:13,961
"Then forget the fried eggs!
Cook me up five or six sausages!"

112
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:16,423
-That's all topsy-turvy now.
-Huh?

113
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,891
What do you think my wife said, then?

114
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,394
-What?
-Huh?

115
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,860
"That's lunch food!"

116
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,445
[laughter]

117
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,451
What a joke!
She's such a ketta-kusowarui shrew.

118
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,042
A husband's got a right
to his own opinions.

119
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,211
That's right.

120
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,886
You're always right, Masuo.
Are you listening?

121
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:43,269
Why's she always gotta nag me?
That ketta-kusowarui shrew.

122
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:44,354
Quit shouting.

123
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:46,317
What exactly is "ketta-kusowarui," anyway?

124
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,074
Sorry.

125
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:55,126
I've just been wondering what
the "ketta" in "ketta-kusowarui" means.

126
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:59,594
You don't even know what that is?

127
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,556
Sorry.

128
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:03,936
Then?

129
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,981
"Us women got our own troubles."

130
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,442
"Like what?"

131
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,620
"There isn't any law that says
a woman can't nag."

132
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:13,956
[Hatsutaro] Are you kidding?

133
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:17,170
That's when I lost
my temper and stormed out.

134
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,717
I'm still all tight in the chest over it.

135
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:24,434
[Hatsutaro] She's got too much time
on her hands.

136
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,860
She's just having fun nagging.
and makin' things worse than they are.

137
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:31,490
I know. I'll go and tell her off.

138
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:33,954
Not at this hour. Isn't that right...

139
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,375
That's right.
Don't you dare. You're drunk.

140
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,045
How dare you!

141
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,807
I know better than anyone
whether I'm drunk or not.

142
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,061
Who do you think I am?
[wheezes]

143
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:47,940
I'm me!

144
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,069
Who are you? Me?

00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:51,280
[Hansuke laughing]

146
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:52,867
He's stinking drunk.

147
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,413
You'll never do
any good in that condition.

148
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,541
Ma'am...

149
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,171
[Hansuke] Wait, Hatsu.

150
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,008

Huh?

Well, if it isn't Hatsu's wife, Yoshie.

155
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,074
Can I share a drink with you?

156
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,830
I was about to have one myself.

It'll overflow.

No, it's totally gone.

165

Here, let me feel for it.

166
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,096
Oh.

167
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,313
Oh, it's beating properly.

168
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:14,655
[Yoshie] Hear it? Thump, thump.

169
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:17,536
[laughs]
Amazing.

170
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,082
It's practically knocking my hand away.

171

That's so amazing.

172

00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,263
How's your heart?

174
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,814
Why don't you feel it with your own hand?

175
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,035
Something wrong?

176
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,120
No.

177
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:42,293
Hatsu fell asleep
the moment he got to Masuo's place.

178
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,717
[Yoshie] You want a fried egg, too?

179

No. Thanks, anyway.

180

[Yoshie] Okay. Good night.

181

[Masuo groans]

182
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:57,992
I forgot.

183
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:03,294
About that "ketta-kusowarui,"
the "ketta" part comes from "kettai."

184
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,214
It means "weird."

185
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,557
In Kansai dialect,
they say, "You're so kettai."

186
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,859
Adding "kusowarui" makes it more intense,
so it means "the weirdest of the weird."

Yeah, it's okay.

-Huh?

Looks like it's gonna rain, Masuo.

201

You're in for it
if you don't come straight home.

-Coming.

208

You know, Mitsuyo, men are just
like children when they're drunk.

-That's for sure, Yoshie.
-[both laugh]

210

[Hansuke] From that day on,

211
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:33,474
Masuo and Hatsutaro mistakenly took
each other's home and wife.

212
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,229
A double affair?

213
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:42,116
Actually, it's not as sordid as that.

214
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,041
[both singing]

215

Thank you.

217
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:54,307
[Hansuke] That day, they had fun
and drank like usual after work.

218
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,186
-Later, Hatsu.
-[Hatsutaro] See ya tomorrow.

219
00:10:56,729 --> 00:11:00,612
But then Masuo went to Hatsu's place,
and Hatsu went to Masuo's place.

220
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:03,827
They're just so... calm about it.

221
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:06,749
They're not the least bit concerned.

222
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,755
It's just so bucolic.

223
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,515
But they're married couples.
Does this kind of thing even happen?

224
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,521
[Tatsuya] It ain't the same
as taking the wrong pay envelope.

225
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:21,403
When we were kids,
we sometimes accidentally took home

226
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:23,616
another kid's textbooks or PE clothes.

227
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,537
What about their clothes?

228
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,879
They seem to have
the same taste in clothes.

229
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:32,634
But the size is a little off.

230
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,934
-Yo, Masuo.
-Nice day, isn't it?

231
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:41,359
They've changed places.
They've changed places.

232
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:42,738
They've changed places!

00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,157
Any other changes?

234
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,413
Neither of them complains
about their wives anymore.

235
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,960
That makes sense.
[laughs]

236
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:53,425
And the wives have
stopped complaining about their husbands.

237
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:57,058
Those vegetables sure are expensive.
Don't you think, Mitsuyo?

238
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:58,937
Yeah, yeah. Thank you!

239
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,567
Fish is expensive, too.
Plain saury is a luxury.

240
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:03,613
Chinese people have learned
how tasty sauries are.

241
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,449
That's what Akira Ikegami on TV says.

It's disgusting. They deserve each other.

They're going to hell.
God will punish them.

they want to switch papas, too.

00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,652
Sprouts isn't on the bus!

323
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,029
[panting]

324
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:58,498
[Okabe] So she ended up staying here,
and eventually got with Ryotaro.

325
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,335
-That's hilarious!
-[laughter]

326
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,174
[shushes]
Ryotaro's a skilled brush maker.

327
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,515
He turned his place into a workshop
and makes quality brushes.

328
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,642
-Here?
-Yeah.

329
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,442
[Tatsuya] For Ryotaro,
who was a fan of Sprouts,

330
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,825
it's like his dream came true,
like he's living his dream.

331
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:19,708
Even though she sleeps
with all the guys in town

332
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,341
and has a baby every year,
he's still living the dream.

333
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:26,137
Sprouts!

334
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,559
[kids] I'm home.

335
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,270
Welcome home.

336
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:33,359
Dinner's almost ready, so wash up.

337
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:34,946
Okay.

338
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,496
[Okabe] In other words,
happiness is different for each person.

339
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,004
[sighs]

340
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,215
[Ryotaro] Careful, it's hot.

341
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,300
[kids] Let's eat!

342
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,385
[Ryotaro] Eat up.

343
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,264
-I'll eat tons.
-Good.

344
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:49,726
-I got a sausage.
-[sobbing]

345
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,688
Dinner's so yummy!

346
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:55,696
Tsutomu, stop crying.
You'll make Rika worry.

347
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,117
What's wrong, Tsutomu?

348
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:04,463
Dad, is it true
that none of us are your children?

349
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:07,427
Who says that?

350
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:08,514
Everyone.

351
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:09,808
Who's everyone?

352
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,398
Everyone. Everyone at school
and in the town.

353
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:15,987
Hmm...

354
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,118
What do you think, Tsutomu?

355
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,255
I know that I'm the father of all of you.

356
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,179
That's why I adore you
and treat you all with love.

357
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:37,487
But if you didn't love me
or didn't believe you're my child,

358
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,870
then I wouldn't be your father.

359
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,166
Isn't that right?

360
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,713
Okay, let's eat.

361
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,090
It's not just me!

362
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,596
Shiro and Mariko have heard it, too.

363
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,144
Our father is somebody else,
and we're the only ones who don't know.

364
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:55,357
They say a DNN test will prove it!

365
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,820
Huh? DN what?

366
00:17:58,196 --> 00:17:59,783
A DNN test!

367
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:00,868
[door slides open]

368
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:02,162
[Misao] I'm home.

369
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,208
-[Ryotaro] Welcome home.
-[door slides shut]

370
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,005
[kids] Welcome home.

371
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,349
People say all kinds of things.

372
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,731
But nobody knows the real truth.

373
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,906
If they say that again, tell them this,

374
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:22,954
"What about your father?"

375
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,423
I'd like to see the person
who can answer that question.

376
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:33,391
In other words, either you trust me,

377
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,188
or trust someone else.

378
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,317
If you don't like me,

379
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:42,451
then go believe that DNN or whatever.

380
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,333
So, who do you believe?

381
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,220
Dad!

382
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:53,724
Dad.

383
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:54,851
Dad.

384
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,270
I believe Mariko.

385
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,732
Her, huh?

386
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,654
-Guess I'm no match for her.
-[all laughing]

387
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,992
Oh, please.

388
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,079
[soft music]

389
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:09,087
What?

390
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:14,223
I've gotta eat for the baby, too.

391
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:16,770
Got a problem with it?

392
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,397
[kids laugh]

393
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:21,320
That's right. Mom's gotta eat for two.

394
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,907
Okay. Let's eat, too.

395
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,076
[kids] Let's eat!

396
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,249
[Hansuke] Happiness is different
for everyone.

397
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,380
We've got no right
to define it for others.

398
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,096
Isn't that right, Tora?

399
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,366
I'm going straight home today.

400
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:45,744
You never have.

401
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:47,999
Then make sure you stop me from drinking.

402
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:49,084
I have been.

403
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:50,671
[grunts]

404
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,096
Hey, what's that? Cut that out, Hatsu.

405
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:56,766
I can't open my eyes.

406
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,731
[Hatsutaro] Hey, that tickles, Masuo.

407
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,659
That tickles, Hatsu. What's your problem?

408
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:10,209
Cut that out! That tickles.
Stop it, Masuo.

409
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,965
Enough, dang it!

410
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,386
What's your darn problem?

411
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:16,681
Jerk.

412
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,184
I've had it!

413
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:40,186
[both singing]

414
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,152
[bar owner] Thank you.

415
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:49,454
[Hansuke] Okay. Tomorrow,
I'll come get you at 7:00 a. m.

416
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,920
-Good night.
-Yeah.

417
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,186
We drank a little too much today, Hatsu.

418
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,486
I sure hope it's sunny again tomorrow.

419
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,079
Okay, let's go home.

420
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:11,916
-Yeah, let's.
-Yeah.

421
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,551
I gotta pee first.

422
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,487
[groans]

423
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,171
Don't look at me like that!

424
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:37,593
Got a problem?

425
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:39,262
What time do you think it is? Huh?

426
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,187
Darn it. Look at yourself.

427
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:44,941
What a smell!

428
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:47,195
I'm home!

429
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:49,617
Good timing. Give me a hand.

430
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,957
Well, if it isn't Masuo.

431
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,126
Weren't you together?

432
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:55,921
[Hatsutaro] I'm not sure.

433
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:57,423
Okay.

434
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,306
Pull yourself together, Masuo. Let's go.

435
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:08,572
Well, if it isn't Hatsu.

436
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:11,451
Don't be like that. He helped you inside.

437
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:15,084
Wow. That's a big surprise.

438
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,673
[laughs, snores]

439

Thanks.

Yeah. Good night.

Hey, tell Yoshie hi.

-Yo.
-Good morning.

It's sunny.

-Weather's great today.
-Morning, Masuo.

448
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,938
Dang, it sure is bright.

449
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:10,361
-Make sure you come straight home.
-I know. It's a no-liquor day.

-Right, Hansuke?
-Hey!

-You forgot your lunch.
-Thanks.

-See you later.

00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:22,427
This weather is unbelievably good.
We'll get sunburned.

Yes, it is. It really is.

[Shima] Hello, everyone. I am Shima.

When do you sense spring has arrived?

465
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:11,818
When cherry blossom buds are growing?

466
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,738
When spring cabbage arrives?

467
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:16,201
Sorry, I forgot. This town has no seasons.
