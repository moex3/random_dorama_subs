00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:04,510
[Hansuke] You've gotten fatter.

3
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:07,223
[Tora] Hansuke, that's cat harassment.

4
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,310
[Hansuke] Get some exercise.
I'll leave this open.

5
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:10,395
Go on.

6
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:14,111
Wonderful weather, isn't it?

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,328
Tanaka, do you have the day off today?

8
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,125
A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

9
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,963
[Shima] Oh, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:26,971
I saw you at the entrance yesterday,
so I took liberties just now.

EPISODE 5
MY WIFE

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,354
I just moved in next door.

13
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:34,026
My name is Shima.

14
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:37,951
There's so much I don't know,
so please help me out.

15
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,120
[chuckles]
Okay.

16
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:45,257
-Now?
-Yes.

17
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:48,346
-[Shima] I'm Shima.
-[Hatsutaro] Shima-san?

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:51,311
Hello.

19
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,901
Sorry, but I'm fresh
out of business cards. I'm Shima.

20
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,112
SHIMA

21
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:57,197
Yes.

22
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:01,414
These are the public water faucets.

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,376
There's water in the houses,

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,382
but since I don't cook,
this here is enough for me.

25
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,802
-[Shima] I see.
-[Hansuke] And--

26
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:09,305
[Shima] Hello. I'm Shima.

27
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,892
I'm the council--

28
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,313
The laundromat is there, and for Wi-Fi...

29
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:16,361
[Shima grunting]

30
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,488
[Hansuke] For Wi...

00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,410
-For Wi...
-[Shima snorts, sniffles]

32
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,039
Sorry.

33
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:25,505
For Wi-Fi, everyone uses the router
at Tatsuya's place.

34
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:27,007
Magnificent.
[chuckles]

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,345
What does everyone do for a bath?

36
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:30,723
The baths here are tiny.

37
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,811
There's a public bath five minutes away.

38
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:35,440
And that flag is the symbol of this--

39
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,823
[Shima grunting]

40
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:43,331
[Hansuke] It starts suddenly,
and even Shima-san can't control it.

41
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:44,709
It's his...

42
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:46,337
What is it?

43
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,970
Habit? Routine?

44
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:54,938
He suddenly freezes up,
and one eyebrow raises.

45
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:58,069
Then he blinks really fast.

46
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,407
Next, each of his eyes

47
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,791
and his mouth go
into separate spasms of their own.

48
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,593
Simultaneously, something seems
to surge up his throat...

49
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,220
[snorts]

50
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,224
...and comes out his nose.

51
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,228
Sorry. Please continue.

52
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:16,774
Uh, where was I?

53
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:19,111
[chuckles awkwardly]
Sorry I can't help you.

54
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:20,740
[sighs]

55
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,077
[comical music]

56
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:27,377
When I was in university,
I was injured playing rugby.

57
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,758
-It must make you curious.
-No, no.

58
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:33,641
[Hansuke] I'm way more curious
about the noise he makes than his leg.

59
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:36,270
I am a real estate broker.

60
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,984
My business also helps
with the reconstruction.

61
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:42,992
I was suddenly transferred here
but couldn't find a place.

62
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,875
My sweet wife wanted to live in a hotel.

63
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:50,215
But the neighborhood
by the station is bad.

64
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,388
-The neighborhood here is way worse.
-[laughs]

65
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,350
This place is really great.

66
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:59,108
It's so nice and open
and everyone's so kind.

67
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:00,193
[grunts]

68
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:02,532
-[Hansuke] Is it happening?
-And the view is nice.

69
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,659
[Hansuke] Guess not.

70
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,625
My sweet wife really loves it here.

71
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:08,961
[Tatsuya] I'm skeptical...

72
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,007
You too?

73
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,844
Anyone who comes here

74
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:16,225
and blabs about themself
is most likely lying about their past.

75
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,311
Right?

76
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:19,189
I'm not sure about Shima-san.

77
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,237
-But his wife…
-You saw his "sweet" wife?

[Tatsuya] Ma'am, what are you doing?

80
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,420
They're rotten.

Oh, dear.

00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,017
Weigh this.

00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:41,818
Ma'am, I don't sell cabbage by weight.
The price is per head.

85
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:44,448
[murmurs]
Unbelievable.

86
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,660
Are you nuts?

87
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,335
You're including
all these rotten leaves in the price?

88
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,844
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Hey. Hey, what're you doing now?

89
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,391
[Shima's wife] I'm posting this.

Fine. Just take it. It's free.

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,375
-Now you've done it!
-[Tatsuya] Huh?

93
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,381
Why, you! Who said I wanted it for free?

94
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:16,303
I told you I would pay, you scumbag!

95
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:17,431
She's really mad.

96
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,017
-What happened?
-All of a sudden she...

97
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,439
Why, you! How dare you treat me
like I'm a problem customer!

98
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:24,194
Now you're really ticking me off!

99
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:25,280
[whimpers]

100
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,034
-She's scary!
-Okay, I'll weigh it!

101
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:32,879
[Tatsuya] But the real surprise
was when she put the leaves she tore off

102
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:36,093
into her shopping bag and walked off.

103
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:40,351
This town's full of freaks,
but she's a new type.

104
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:42,565
"New type"?
[laughing]

105
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:45,905
Even the ladies at the water said,
"Shima's a nice guy,

106
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:49,746
but I can't stand spasm-man's noise
and his beastly wife!"

107
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:51,541
[thudding]

00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,629
[Shima's wife] Odore!

109
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:56,217
-Okabe.
-You left the bathroom light on, odore!

110
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:58,012
[whispers]
It's your fault, Okabe.

111
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:59,682
[Shima's wife] Darn it, odore!

112
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,520
What's your problem, odore?

113
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,191
She's saying, "dancing dunce!"

114
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,443
"Dancing dunce"?

115
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,865
This is bad. The walls are so thin here.

116
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:08,951
"Dancing dunce"?

117
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:14,211
You should probably go over and apologize.

-[banging on door]
-[all grunting]

119

[banging continues]

120
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,370
Dinkin'?

121
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:34,836
"Dinkin'"? Oh, are we drinking? Yes.

122
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,463
-Want to join us?
-Hey!

123
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:37,633
Magnificent!

124
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:40,471
Wait. I'll be right back.

125
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:43,937
Then Shima-san brought over
expensive wine, caviar, and hard bread.

126
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:45,983
It was like a fancy party.

127
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:49,072
In temporary housing?
This guy's getting more mysterious.

128
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:51,452
[Shima] So, do you guys know

129
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:57,214
of a legal way to make good money
with a single magic marker?

130
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:00,136
-A magic marker?
-That's right.

131
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:05,396
Buy one at a convenience store
and go to Shinagawa Station.

132
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,275
Or Shin-Osaka Station in Osaka.

133
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,323
If you spend all day at the ticket gate,

134
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:14,540
baseball players,
and TV stars will pass through for sure.

135
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,838
"I'm your fan. Can I have your autograph?"

136
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:22,055
Then you sell it on the web.

137
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,142
-[Hansuke] No, no.
-[Okabe] No way.

138
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:25,854
I mean it.

139
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:29,862
For Emiko Kaminuma,
you can get up to 20,000 yen.

140
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:32,200
-No, no.
-No way.

141
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,246
[chuckling]

142
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,835
But then we figured something out.

143
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:42,095
For just an autograph,
it doesn't have to be the real thing.

144
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,942
We studied handwriting
and copied autographs all night long.

145
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,654
[chuckles]

146
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:55,706
For a while there,
my sweet wife did more Kaminuma autographs

147
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,960
than Kaminuma herself.

148
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,218
Understand?

149
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:04,347
-[Hansuke and Okabe chuckle]
-Do you understand?

150
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:10,318
If you abandon your pride,
you can make money in a million ways.

151
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,326
What a scumbag.

152
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,288
To be honest, I was disgusted.

153
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,839
[Hansuke] But Tatsuya,
the most suspicious, wanted to know more.

154
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,181
This has faded a lot,

155
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:28,814
but it's the autograph
of some pop idol when they visited.

156
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,820
-50,000.
-Seriously?

157
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:35,409
I've got a ball
autographed by Shinjo at home.

158
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,665
Do you need money, Yoda?

159
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,086
-His brother's in the hospital.
-Hey!

160
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,679
Why don't you come down to our office?
I can get you work.

161
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:46,390
But...

162
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:47,810
[laughs]

163
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,148
Now, we've branched out a lot.

164
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:54,824
We utilize open innovation, for example,
to start cafes in underpopulated towns.

165
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,203
-Cafes? Did you hear that?
-Cafes? Cafes?

166
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:03,090
Actually, our Young Men's Club
has a plan to open a cafe here.

167
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,303
Magnificent!

168
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:07,892
Let's do something together.

169
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,313
My business card.
Where's my business cards?

170
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:11,398
[grunts]

171
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,616
[Hansuke] And now,
Tatsuya is working at Shima's company.

172
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,037
But I don't get it.

173
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:20,458
It's not underpopulated,
because there's no cafe.

174
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,753
It's the other way around.

175
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,047
What about you?

176
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:24,842
About what?

177
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:26,470
Isn't it obvious?

178
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:29,142
You haven't sent me
any reports at all lately.

179
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:31,438
-Quit blowing me off.
-[thuds]

180
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,321
Who reads those things anyway?

181
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:36,950
I do.

182
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,960
But someone asked you for them
so you had me do them, right?

183
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,383
That town's gonna be torn down.

184
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:51,478
Don't make that face.
It's temporary housing, after all.

185
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,946
But... you said it so casually.

186
00:08:56,446 --> 00:09:00,998
None of them will leave easily
so we need dirt on them.

187
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,168
[softly]
I see.

188
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:07,595
The homeless and foreigners move in
all the time.

189
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:11,059
That Shima guy will just sublet his place.

190
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:14,859
Whoever lived there before
just might be dead anyway.

191
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,322
Thanks.

192
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:18,908
I'll look into him.

193
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,996
[somber music]

194
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,421
-No, no. It's okay.
-Take it.

195
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,968
Keep an eye on them.

196
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:30,056
I didn't finish again.

197
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:36,151
[purring]

198
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:43,332
Shrimp.

199
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,712
-Shrimp.
-[Hansuke] Tora.

200
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,133
Isn't that you, Tora?

201
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,471
What're you doing here, Tora?

202
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:52,141
Tora!

203
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,855
[shouts]

204
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,191
[cries]

205
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:59,406
[Hansuke] Tora didn't
come back home that day.

206
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,078
Tora!

207
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:05,251
It's open seating,
so sit anywhere you like.

208
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:06,879
-Okay.
-There.

209
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:12,306
[Hansuke] Shima-san seems to like Tatsuya,
so he's working pretty hard.

210
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:15,271
-Good morning.
-[employees] Good morning.

211
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:16,733
[Shima] Doing well?

212
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:20,741
[Hansuke] Tora?

213
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,751
Tora?

214
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:33,390
-Welcome home.
-[screams]

215
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:35,645
Are you kidding?

216
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,064
The window was open.

217
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:39,528
The front door was too!

218
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,741
The window is for Tora to come in.

219
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,333
I got this. It's really good.
It's a new product.

220
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,462
Thank you.

221
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,675
I delivered liquor next door.

222
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,303
To Shima's place?

223
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:54,349
They're having guests tonight.

224
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,769
Hey!

225
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,658
What? Is something up?

226
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,630
There's... a girl I like.

227
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:11,634
-Katsuko?
-What?

228
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:13,638
How did you know?

229
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,559
You're not trying to hide it.

230
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,644
[shushes]

231
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,525
[Okabe] That poor girl.

232
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,071
Her uncle's a drunkard.

233
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,700
[presenter] Now for the weather.

234
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,996
It better be sunny tomorrow.

235
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,668
The laundry is really piling up.

236
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:32,885
You're always complaining
about the weather.

237
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:36,684
Are you a meteorologist or something?

238
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,105
Or maybe an astronomer?

239
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,817
My shoulders are so stiff.

240
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,320
-[snickers]
-[groans]

241

[scoffs]

242
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:48,415
That's not pain caused by illness,

243
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,338
but pain caused by movement.

244
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:52,549
A little harder.

245
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,553
That's the way.
[sighs]

246
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,521
So sometimes I'd give her snacks
and chat with her.

247
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:05,157
Fine. Next time, I'll do it in secret.

248
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,788
Don't do that. Be out in the open with it.

249
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:10,000
[distant laughter]

250
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:11,796
That really was fun.

251
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,219
I realized and learned a lot
from today's discussion.

252
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,304
[Shima] This is it.

253
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:22,066
Hello! I'm home!

254
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:25,114
Actually, we should probably be going.

255
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,997
It's all right.
She's looking forward to this too.

256
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,834
[Shima] Hey!

257
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,005
Maybe she's at bath.

258
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:35,719
Is it okay?

259
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:37,723
Come in.

260
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,729
This place is nothing to be afraid of.

261
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,150
Come on in.

262
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,655
There. Have a seat.

263
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:47,993
[groans]

264
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:49,580
Take a load off.

265
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,291
Okay.

266
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,961
[Shima exhales loudly]

00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,096
[sniffles]

268
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,852
[exclaims]
There aren't any glasses.

269
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,271
I'll get them.

00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:03,649

-Sure.

[employee 1] I realized and learned a lot
from today's discussion.

275
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,509
[employee 2] I bet you did.

276
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:22,144
[employee 1] For innovation to work,
you need to respect the local residents.

277
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,271
[clattering]

278
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,357
You're here?

279
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:29,117
Get out here and greet everyone.

280
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:32,498
They are promising members of our team.

281
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,795
Come out. I'll introduce you.

282
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:37,509
[Shima's wife groans]
The signal here sucks.

283
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,262
Darn this cell phone signal.

284
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,309
This ticks me off.

285
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:48,531
It's all the fault of jerks showing up
in the middle of the night to mooch.

286
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,996
You know, Hamaguchi,
those Yakult Swallows sure aren't winning.

-Huh?
-[Shima chuckles]

288

[clears throat]
Uhm, this is my sweet wife.

289
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,847
[Shima] This is Igawa and Hamaguchi.

290
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,601
You've met Yoda, right?

291
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,063
No, we haven't met properly.

292
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,401
Sorry to drop in at night.

293

[Hansuke] "This would be the right time
for one of my spasms."

294
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,515
That's probably what Shima-san thought.

295
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:28,151
But it's always at times like this
that it doesn't turn up.

[exhales sharply]

297
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,376
I'm going to the bath. There's barazushi.

[door slams]

299
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,728
Okay, let's drink.

00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:48,316
Daiginjo sake.
[chuckles]

301
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,613
Let's start over.

302
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,659
Igawa got this first.

303
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,124
You just had a son, didn't you?

304
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,502
That's me.

305
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:00,257
Oh, that's right. We need to celebrate.

306
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,635
There.

307
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:03,848
There. Here you go.

308
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:05,768
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

309
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,193
There we go.

310
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:12,448
Once more.

311
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:14,410
Cheers!

[breathes deeply]

315
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,910
We should drink it warm.
It's cold tonight.

316
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,832
It's okay. I'll do it.

317
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:39,878
Thanks.

318
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:43,594
[Hansuke] All three of them
were moved to tears in their hearts.

319
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:47,476
Shima-san has a disability
and a health issue,

320
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:51,442
yet he's cheerful, happy, and polite.

321

But as he bustled
about to serve his guests,

322
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,206
all they could do was watch.

[Shima grunts]

324
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:06,347
Barazushi is a specialty in our home.

00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,270
You can't get started without eating it.

326

[chuckles]

327
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,781
Oh, right.

328
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:18,121
Do you know of a legal way
to make good money with a magic--

329
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:19,916
[Igawa] Selling autographs, right?

330
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,381
[Tatsuya] Sorry. I told them.

331
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:24,593
You did?

332
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,557
Forgery is a crime,
so you should be careful.

333
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,351
That was a long time ago.

334
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,314
I don't do that stuff now.

335
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:32,399
[awkward chuckle]

336
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:34,069
Shima-san...

337
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:37,242
-You know how to get soup kitchen food--
-Shima-san.

338
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,328
Yes?

339
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:44,841
Tonight, we're, like,
uninvited guests, right?

340
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,302
Why do you think that?

341
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:48,139
Isn't it obvious?

342
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:49,433
[grunts]

343
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,199
Did I say something to offend you?

344
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,328
No, no. You're a nice guy, Shima-san.

345
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,790
A really nice guy.

346
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:03,921
But... In fact, that's why I wonder...

347
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,302
about what happened earlier.

348
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,764
Earlier?

349
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,770
You introduced us
to your "sweet" wife, right?

350
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:16,320
That's why Igawa
and Hamaguchi greeted her.

351
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:19,285
But her attitude...

352
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,748
Now, now, Yoda. That's enough.

353
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,084
Sorry about that.

354
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,673
You shouldn't apologize, Shima-san.

355
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:28,344
That's right.
I'm not criticizing you, Shima-san.

356
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,348
In fact, I respect you.

357
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,352
How do I put this?

358
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,315
You feel righteous indignation?

359
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,364
I don't really get it, but sorry.

360
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:41,120
Like I said, you shouldn't be apologizing.

361
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,497
No, no, Igawa.

362
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:46,297
That's the kind of woman she is.
She's bad at expressing emotion.

363
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,800
It's way more than that!

364
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,721
Like I said, I'm sorry.

365
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,432
He's not mad at you.

366
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,518
Are you mad?

367
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,856
If he is, he's mad at you
for not getting mad.

368
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,067
That's right.

369
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,033
Forget how she treated us.
It was pretty bad though.

370
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:04,834
But what I won't stand for
is her attitude toward you, her husband.

371
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,546
She sure didn't show any respect.

372
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,550
She didn't even say "welcome home."

373
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,517
She complained about the signal,
threw the food on the table,

374
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,438
tossed the potato chips and seethed.

375
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,069
"Going to the bath." Slam!
What's with that?

376
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:19,614
I'm ticked off.

377
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,077
-What's with that?
-I said I'm sorry.

378
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:25,668
Like I said,
you should have gotten mad at her.

379
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:29,509
Your wife's treating us with contempt.

380
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,264
Even in this town...

381
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:35,186
In fact, because we live in this town,

382
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:38,819
we greet each other properly
and treat each other with respect!

383
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:43,453
Even Kuma and Roku-chan
and the homeless guys do!

384
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:45,415
I'm apologizing in her stead.

385
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:46,877
Quit apologizing!

386
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,089
Why do it for that woman?

387
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,634
It's pathetic!

388
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:54,559
Instead of apologizing to us,
kick that woman out of this house!

389
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:55,728
[grumbles]

390
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,774
Whoa! Stop it!

[Tatsuya] Shima-san!

392
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,159
Hey, how dare you say that? How dare you?

[panting]

396
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:10,298
Kick her out?

397
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:13,764
I wouldn't kick her out
even if she had hurt you,

398
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,477
but she hasn't done a thing to you!

399
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,649
[Hamaguchi] Cut this out, you two.

400
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,986
It's okay.
Let's listen to what he has to say.

401
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,155
She is...

402
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,159
She is my sweet wife.

403
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:30,088
To you guys, she may seem like
she's not worth dime.

404
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,096
But no matter what anyone says,

405
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,060
she is my sweet wife!

406
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,026
She's suffered through a lot.

407
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,032
She suffered for my sake.

408
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,957
She waited for famous people
at Shinagawa Station.

409
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:50,796
She lined up
at the soup kitchens countless times.

410
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,598
She put up with poverty so bad
that she had to do

411
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,142
those humiliating things.

412
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,062
So how dare you!

413
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:04,197
What right do you have
to tell me to kick her out?

414
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:09,333
What the heck do you know
about me and her?

415
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,961
[Hamaguchi] That's enough, Shima-san.

416
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:12,047
Let go of him.

417

That was inappropriate of me.

please forgive me.

Okay.

You, Young Men's Club,
have some barazushi.

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,382
What's going on?

[Tanba-san]
Tanba from building seven here.

492
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:09,897
Everyone thinks old folks know everything,
but there's stuff I don't know.

493
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,358
Like taking medicine.

494
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,863
When do you take it
if it's "before or during meals"?

495
00:24:13,947 --> 00:24:16,953
And nobody has any idea
when that homeless father and son arrived.

496
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:18,205
But that's normal.

497
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,000
Episode six is "A Home with a Pool."
