1
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:05,469
[Rich Man]
The best place would be on top of a hill.

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,391
[Rich Man's son]
Yes. I think you're right.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,520
A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

4
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,565
[Rich Man] Since ancient times,

5
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:15,280
the Japanese have always wanted
to build homes in low places,

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,328
such as at the foot of mountains
or in valleys.

7
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,502
[Rich Man's son]
Yes, you're right about that.

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:24,131
There is a good reason for that.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,433
There are a lot of earthquakes
and typhoons in Japan, right?

10
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,857
Selecting low places,

11
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,070
where disasters are rare,

12
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:38,285
is a necessity, in a way.

13
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:39,913
Yes.

14
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,086
It's a necessity,
so it has to be that way.

15
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:45,717
[Kuniko] There.

16
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:48,764
Oh, what good timing.
[soft chuckle]

17
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,893
There are exactly two left over.

18
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:57,907
Here you go.

19
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:00,705
Thank you.

20
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,796
[light music]

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,261
[Hansuke] Rich Man and his son live
in the garbage dump.

22
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:10,600
When it's your own home,

23
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,856
you can't be worrying
about ethnic characteristics.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,860
I don't think…

25
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:20,494
[Hansuke] They talk with each other about
the house that they'll build someday.

26
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:24,043
The boy doesn't go to school.

27
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,840
He is a little small
to be in middle school,

28
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:29,763
-but he speaks like a grown-up.
-[children chattering in distance]

29
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:31,934
Okay!

30
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:37,319
Question! What's for dinner today?

31
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:38,739
[Tora] Cat rice, obviously.

32
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:41,369
It's cat rice!

33
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:44,041
-[Hansuke singing]
-[Tora] How can you always get so excited?

34
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,878
It's called "cat rice,"

35
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:49,845
but cats only eat it because we feel
obliged to since it's named after us.

36
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:52,307
But I've never met a cat
who liked cat rice.

37
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,521
Taco-flavored rice is way more popular.

38
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:58,486
Now for the seasoning!

39
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,449
Yay! Cat rice!

40
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,914
-[Tora] Dang it! I can't stop eating it!
-[singing continues]

41
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:07,714
Cat rice! Cat-cat-cat-cat rice!

42
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:09,926
[Hansuke] Huh?

43
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:12,599
[Tatsuya] Cat rice! Cat rice!

44
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:16,314
Cat rice! Cat…
[panting]

45
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,567
Happy about something?

46
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:19,613
-[Hansuke] No.
-Really?

47
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:22,493
Even so, you're really upbeat. Amazing!

48
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,666
Cat rice. Cat rice. Cat-cat-cat…

49
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,712
-I make a presentation tomorrow.
-Yeah?

50
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:30,635
If it goes well,
we just might get a café here!

51
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,139
-That's great.
-Yes!

52
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:38,399
You know, Shima-san is really amazing.

53
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,251
Without him,
it may have ended as just a dream.

54
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:52,010
[Tatsuya] Welcome!

55
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:55,893
[elder 1]
When I watch TV all day like this,

56
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,943
I get the feeling that I can say
funnier things than they do on TV.

57
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,487
-[indistinct chatter on TV]
-"Of course!

58
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:05,203
You couldn't hold it if it was crunchy
in the middle and creamy on the outside."

59
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,291
[laughing]

60
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,756
Katsuko, I'm pretty funny, right?

61
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:13,469
[elder 2] I'm checking into the hospital.

62
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,390
Huh?

63
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:18,897
[Okabe] Liquor Shop Okabe here.
I've got a delivery.

64
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,612
They need to run tests.

65
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:25,160
The lump in my breast
seems to be getting bigger.

66
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:31,172
You'd better get that checked
from a medical point of view.

67
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,886
Are you tired?

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,769
Just as you ordered,

69
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,524
a case of Strong Shochu Highballs

70
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:44,156
and a two-liter bottle of shochu.
This is a free calendar.

71
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,494
Who needs that?
Give me an extra can of Strong.

72
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:50,085
Sorry, but this comes free
with the shochu.

73
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,339
-[elder 1] Then give me a free bottle.
-[elder 2] Sorry.

74
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,719
He's drunk.

75
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,397
It's 3,240 yen.

76
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:06,827
[whispering]
You can have this.

77
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,335
[Hansuke]
Rich Man and his son get up early.

78
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,053
[slow-paced music]

79
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:27,117
They collect the empty cans
before the trash truck comes.

80
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,248
-That's their morning routine.
-[cans clattering]

81
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,105
[Rich Man] When you build a house,
first you must decide on the front gate.

82
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,449
The front gate is like
the face of the house.

83
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:50,163
[Rich Man's son] You're right.

84
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,712
You can tell what a person is like
from their face.

85
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:58,262
Actually, that is not always true.

86
00:04:58,764 --> 00:04:59,849
You're right.

87
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,812
They say you can't judge a book
by its cover.

88
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:06,696
Actually, they're often
just what they appear to be.

89
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,159
-Which is it?
-Huh?

90
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,927
At any rate, we must first decide on

91
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,852
the front gate, the doorway, the entrance.

92
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,110
[Tatsuya] The entrance is designed
to resemble a Hawaiian bungalow.

93
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,487
And it's accessible for everyone.

94
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:30,201
[Shima] It looks nice and cool.
[chuckles]

95
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,621
What about that boat banner?

96
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:35,044
-It's the town symbol.
-[Shima] I like it.

97
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:37,007
But there's no sign.

98
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,346
[Tatsuya] Sorry, but I haven't come up
with a name for the café.

99
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,269
[soft chuckle]
Let's think of one, together.

100
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,983
[staff] Something easy to remember.

101
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:49,114
-[rain pattering]
-The gate should be European style.

102
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,745
How about Rococo style?

103
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:54,041
Yes, I like it.

104
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,005
Spanish is nice too.

105
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:01,138
English style is okay too.

106
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,482
But something more casual, more familiar
would be nice.

107
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,532
Oh, I've got it!

108
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,662
How about Station?

109
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,249
[all] "Station"?

110
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,422
It's a French word that means "station."

111
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:22,055
-Is this about Roku-chan?
-Right.

112
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,474
Dodes'ka-den.

113
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,729
[Shima] A train runs through that town.

114
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,860
If you're boarding, please hurry.

115
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,448
[Shima] But nobody rides it.

116
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:34,329
-I've often wondered why that is.
-All aboard.

117
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,543
-I think it's because there is no station.
-[imitates train chuffing]

118
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:40,049
If there's a station,
Roku-chan can take a break.

119
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,387
Right, Yoda?

120
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:46,437
I'll rework it
based on this station concept.

121
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:50,571
-Oui! Café de Station, très bien.
-[soft chuckle]

122
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:52,867
[Rich Man] Next are the outer walls.

123
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:57,083
Since the color of the walls determines
the building's overall character,

124
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,670
we must be prudent.

125
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,091
[Rich Man's son]
There are certainly many types of houses.

126
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,636
How about that one?

127
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:06,519
[sucks teeth]
Salmon pink, huh?

128
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,778
It makes me doubt their character.

129
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,784
[Rich Man's son] You're right.
It's rather unpleasant.

130
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,334
[Rich Man] And walls made of concrete
are no good. They have a pretentious air.

131
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,672
[Rich Man's son] Total nouveau riche.
How revolting.

132
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,181
[Rich Man] Harmony with the surroundings
is also vital.

133
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,266
[Rich Man's son] Yes.

134
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:30,274
[Rich Man]
However, beige is too unrefined.

135
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,030
[Rich Man's son]
It shows a total lack of thought.

136
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:35,994
[elder] Excuse me…

137
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,796
Little boy, buy some sweets with this.

138
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,257
[children chattering in distance]

139
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,350
[Rich Man's son] I'm sorry,
but we don't accept that kind of thing.

140
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,022
[Hansuke]
They never accept handouts of cash.

141
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:53,989
And they never ask for food themselves.

142
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:55,116
[elder] Then…

143
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,758
Thank you.

144
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:07,808
[Hansuke] They have
their own kind of pride and principles

145
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:10,354
they strictly adhere to.

146
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,868
I think there is a modern-style house
built with wood in the next town.

147
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,412
Let's go see it.

148
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:23,924
I would really love to go,
but I should be going to Miyashita Ginza.

149
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,763
The tempura restaurant is about to open.

150
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,644
[Rich Man] I see.

151
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:33,526
There's no need
to decide on the walls right now.

152
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:35,446
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,974
[Hansuke]
It was the boy's job to gather food.

154
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:51,436
[chef] Tonight, there is a banquet.

155
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,278
Come back around 9:00 p.m.

156
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:59,035
-Heat it up before you eat it.
-[Rich Man's son] Thank you!

157
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:02,333
[Hansuke]

[Rich Man] There will be two buildings,

The land between will be a garden.

Yes. We have
2,000 square meters of land, after all.

The big issue is the kitchen.

Should it be a simple Japanese style,

Thank you for this food.

[Hansuke]
The father never stopped talking about it.

As for the European home…

195
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,134
[Hansuke] It was as if…

196
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,389
he was dulling
his sense of smell and taste

197
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:17,854
so he wouldn't focus on the food
that he was eating.

198
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:21,361
However, very occasionally…

Goodness me. If it isn't roast beef.

00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,755
Yes. The fancy restaurant chef
gave it to me.

202
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,928
It's been ages.

203
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:38,145
It's been cooked perfectly rare.
[chuckles]

You can have mine too.

[Rich Man] What? Why?

206
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,198
I don't like undercooked meat.

207
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:49,292
Beef, my boy, is eaten raw in the West.

If I'm not mistaken,
in the Bavarian region of Germany…

[Rich Man] Now for the drawing room.

213
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,958
Of course, there must be
central heating and cooling.

214
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:16,471
You must want to go to sleep.

We'll do it tomorrow.

[Hansuke] Well,

227
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:28,365
I'm sure the father was distressed by it,

228
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:32,039
but about when they'd settled on
placement of the furniture,

00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,377

[Rich Man] Oh.

235
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,379
-That's vinegared mackerel.
-[cat meows]

236
00:13:57,006 --> 00:14:00,555
The sushi chef told me
that I must cook it before eating.

237
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,268
[soft chuckle]
He is clearly mistaken.

238
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:07,944
It is preserved with vinegar and salt
so it can be eaten without cooking.

239
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,619
But the sushi chef said…

240
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:14,958
[Hansuke] It didn't happen often,
but the son disagreed with him.

241
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:19,425
Yes. It's thick and delicious.

242

You're right. It's delicious.

00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,869
[Hansuke] That night,
both the father and son had a stomachache.

249
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,005
This isn't the vinegared mackerel.

Yes, you're right.

[both groan]

252
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:07,689
If it were the vinegared mackerel,
we would first get hives.

253
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:13,241
Then we would vomit.

254
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,663
Then what is it?

255
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,336
[Hansuke] The father's symptoms
subsided after three days.

256
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:24,138
However, the son grew
more emaciated with every day.

-At times like this, we must fast.

I'm not asking you
to go to Miyashita Ginza.

Or else it'll be too late!

00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,327
They've got nowhere else to go!

317
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,665
That's why they came back!

318
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,546
Leave them be, dang it!

319
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,638
[shouting]
But… But if he dies, what's the point?

320
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,394
[Tanba-san] I called a doctor.

321
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,652
Don't you worry.

322
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:27,035
I'm sure they don't have insurance,
but he'll still check him.

323
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:28,245
[door clicks]

324
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,226
What did you say?

325
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:45,739
Pool…

326
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,077
A pool?

327
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,588
There's… a pool.

328
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:56,176
Thank you.

329
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,944
[tranquil music]

330
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,225
[tranquil music continues]

331
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:44,941
[Hansuke] The doctor came.

332
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,241
But it was too late.

333
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:53,040
[music fades]

334
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:55,712
COMMUNITY MEETING FOR CONSTRUCTION
OF CAFÉ DE STATION

335
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,971
The meeting where Tatsuya explained
to the community about his café was held.

336
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,142
Ain't nobody else comin'.

337
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,979
Hurry up and get started!

338
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:06,233
[Hansuke] Only three people showed up.

339
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:11,201
Thank you, everyone,
for gathering here today.

340
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:13,080
[resident]
There are only three people here.

341
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,709
Uhm…

342
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,422
Uh, excuse me…

343
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,598
[staff 1] That was hard to sit through.

344
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,643
[staff 2] I'll call a taxi.

345
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,774
[crows cawing]

346
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,977
[rattling]

347
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:51,741
[Hansuke] Ultimately, Tatsuya's café

348
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,747
and the house with the pool

349
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,795
ended only as dreams.

350
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,007
[somber music]

351
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:04,600
Rich Man left the town
and started living under a bridge.

352
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,527
Oh, Katsuko.
[soft chuckle]

353
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,823
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

354
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:14,244
[somber music continues]

355
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,503
[Okabe] Did you lose a coin?

356
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:20,549
[Rich Man] I'd agree…

357
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:25,349
that having a pool with white tiles
in the middle of the garden would be nice.

358
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:31,069
However, there can be problems
with water supply and drainage systems.

359
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:36,079
But don't worry. I'm sure we can build it.

360
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,208
I promise.

361
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,091
You see,

362
00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:44,930
the only thing you asked me for…

363
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,481
-was to build a pool.
-[water lapping]

364
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:55,242
You should have…

365
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:59,585
asked for all the things that you wanted.

366
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,100
[Okabe] Okabe of Liquor Shop Okabe here.

367
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:09,897
I talked to Katsuko
when making deliveries again today.

368
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,818
Actually, I did all the talking.

369
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:15,617
I wondered if she was bored,
and when I looked, she was asleep.

370
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,702
She must be tired.

371
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:18,915
Episode seven is, "Ganmodoki."

372
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:20,000
Ganmodoki?

373
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,130
