1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,801
A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

2
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:09,603
[loud horns and whistles]

3
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:13,109
[Okabe] Katsuko, when's your birthday?

4
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:16,115
[cheerful music playing]

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,661
Wait. Let me guess.

6
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,334
I bet it's July.

7
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,756
EPISODE 7
GANMODOKI: PART 1 OF 2

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,843
Then, is it August?

9
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,433
Not September, right?

10
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:30,979
October?

11
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:33,358
It's October!

12
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:36,072
Then, are you a Libra?

13
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:38,410
Scorpio?

14
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,999
Oh, then your birthday's coming up soon.

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,463
[Hansuke]
No, it's not really coming up soon.

16
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:45,800
It's way off.

17
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:47,762
[Okabe] I wonder what I should get.

18
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,600
What would make her happy?

19
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,189
I doubt anything would make her happy.

20
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,485
Hey, don't say that about her.

21
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,949
She may not look it,
but she has many emotions.

22
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:01,915
When she's happy, her brow unfurrows.

23
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,420
When she's mad,
her nostrils flare a little.

24
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:07,969
When she's sad, she slouches a little.

25
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,180
When she's surprised,

26
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:11,267
she stumbles.

27
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,689
Nobody can see those tiny changes.

28
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:16,653
I know! Clothes.

29
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:20,536
Clothes? You're gonna buy her clothes
for her birthday?

30
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,793
I can't imagine how that would work.

31
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,339
I wonder what she'd look good in.

32
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,719
What's she usually wear anyway?

33
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:31,642
I don't know. I don't look at her clothes.

34
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:35,232
How old is she anyway?

35
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:36,860
I have no idea.

36
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:39,407
It took me three years
just to find out her birthday.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,916
Have her aunt
and uncle always taken care of her?

38
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:49,093
That's not quite the right nuance
for their relationship.

39
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,721
[Hatsutaro] "Nuance"?

40
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:54,437
You're amazing, Masuo.
You know some really big words.

41
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,898
[Hansuke] What do you mean?

42
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,946
Originally, after The What,

43
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:02,286
Katsuko and her mom lived together alone.

44
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,415
Yeah. She was a single mother.

45
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,002
[Man-to-Man's owner] Welcome.

46
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,045
But then one day,

47
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,597
her mom abandoned
Katsuko and left the town.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,185
She married some rich CEO.

49
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,901
Then her aunt moved in with her husband.

50
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:19,529
You mean she sublet it?

51
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:23,662
The uncle, Kyota,
was a middle school teacher,

52
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:26,167
but he drank too much and got fired.

53
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:29,256
Their income comes just from
Katsuko's work at home

54
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:32,179
and the money Katsuko's mom sends.

55
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:34,976
That's the "nuance."

56
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:39,903
So, the "nuance" is that Katsuko is
the one taking care of the aunt and uncle?

57
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,532
How dare you say such a thing!

58
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,453
Sorry.

59
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,249
-This guy's drunk.
-Huh?

60
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:51,510
[customer] We once bargained with her mom,

61
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:54,808
and said we'd send Katsuko
to high school if she increased

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,479
the money she sent every month.

63
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,149
[Hansuke] Is that him?

64
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,277
Then…

65
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,951
her mom, the CEO's wife showed up.

66
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,542
She reeked of perfume.

67
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:19,983
SIX YEARS EARLIER

68
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,864
SHINSHINMARU 88

69
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:24,576
[resident 1] Whose car is that?

70
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,874
[drum march playing]

71
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,586
[resident 1] That's quite a car.

72
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,508
[drum march continues]

73
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,261
[resident 1]
What's she here for?

74
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,941
Katsuko, it's your mother.

75
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,695
Come out and say hello.

76
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,874
[drumming continues]

77
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,295
Katsuko?

78
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,053
Is it really you?

79
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,646
Hmm.

80
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,232
[residents chattering]

81
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:02,944
[resident 2] That fancy way of

82
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:04,698
wearing a coat must be in vogue.

83
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,910
[resident 3] It's just on her shoulders.

84
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,498
[resident 4]
Her arms aren't even in the sleeves.

85
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,835
Dear me.

86
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,091
You look like a crushed ganmodoki.

87
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:16,345
[dispiriting bell chimes]

88
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:17,974
[Kyota] I know that

89
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:22,608
ever since that day,
you people, behind Katsuko's back,

90
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:26,073
you call her "Ganmodoki."

91
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:31,585
But the people here,
they never criticized that woman.

92
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:35,551
The same people who mock Katsuko
and call her "Ganmodoki"

93
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,766
don't feel any hostility toward
that arrogant rich snob,

94
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:41,730
and view her with admiration and envy.

95
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,109
Do you know why that is?

96
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,113
[Hatsutaro] We'll be going now.

97
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:49,579
-I'll pay, Masuo.
-Thanks.

98
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,373
-Come again.
-Excuse me.

99
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,879
You go ahead and sit down.

100
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,173
Sit down.

101
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:56,383
-Huh?
-Sit.

102
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,804
Tomorrow, 7:00 a.m.

103
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,264
-Okay.
-Thanks.

104
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:00,391
Thank you.

105
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,895
Thanks for the food.

106
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:06,487
Now, let's look at it psychologically.

107
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,702
Let's say that CEO's wife came here

108
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,124
handing out relief supplies,

109
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:14,754
and saying, "Hang in there,"

110
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:18,344
and shaking people's hands.
What would you think?

111
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,225
It would tick me off.

112
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:22,687
How come?

113
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,901
That kind of thing is hypocrisy.

114
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:33,416
People commit hypocrisy to affirm
their status and feel superior.

115
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,796
It even says so in the Bible.

116
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:39,386
"When you give to the needy,
don't let your left hand know

117
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,475
what your right hand is doing."

118
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,816
Right? Go on, drink.

119
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,943
Thanks.

120
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,576
The reason they aren't hostile to
that CEO's wife is

121
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,957
because she is just like
the people who live here.

122
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,753
Just like them?

123
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,634
She's one of them,
but she's a success story.

124
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:02,808
They also just might have
a bright future like she's got.

125
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:05,522
That's why they don't criticize her.

126
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:09,029
What about Katsuko?

127
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:10,490
She's the same as them.

128
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:12,285
That's why they mock her.

129
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,375
You could even say that they despise her.

130
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,670
But why?

131
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:21,178
Katsuko's so virtuous and dedicated,
so why are they like that to her?

132
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,265
Shouting at Tanba-san won't help.

133
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,144
That's so cruel.

134
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:27,608
Calling her
a rotten ganmodoki is so cruel.

135
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,486
Not "rotten." "Crushed."

136
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,618
She's hard-working,
gets up before everyone,

137
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,329
and even sweeps

138
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:37,753
in front of the neighbors' homes
though nobody asks her to.

139
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,801
Yeah, she's plain…

140
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,682
and unsocial…

141
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:47,397
But she's a nice girl
who doesn't bother anyone.

142
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,944
That's exactly the point.

143
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,244
What's the point?

144
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,708
We work and work, but are never rewarded,

145
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,754
and life never gets easier.

146
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:04,389
Katsuko is the embodiment of
our unfair lot in life.

147
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,393
She's personified poverty.

148
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,024
That's why she's hated.

149
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:14,660
Accepting her would mean
accepting our own poverty.

150
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:19,962
This is far enough.

151
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:24,387
[Hansuke] Her aunt Taeko was
to be hospitalized for three weeks.

152
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:27,477
Bye.

153
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,857
Don't push yourself too hard.

154
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,189
Non-woven masks, huh?

155
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,406
Can't believe it has to be done by hand.

156
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,995
If only you were…

157
00:07:58,038 --> 00:07:59,584
a little more attractive…

158
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,048
and had a more feminine body…

159
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,390
If you were more like a womanly woman…

160
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:09,394
[radio chatter in background]

161
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:12,025
…there are ways
you could make money more easily.

162
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,070
But the way you are…

163
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:18,705
folding masks into bellows is
the best you can do.

164
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,713
The little mask girl.

it's been awkward around Tatsuya.

Would it be like saying "stop"?

There's no time to worry about that!
We've gotta…

You're the one who reported them, right?

198
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:06,963
[Hansuke] I wonder if Tatsuya knows
that I'm reporting on the town

Tailor-made, huh?

Shima-san's actually pretty conservative.

He wants full-time employees

Probably Hansuke's shorts.

Your sunglasses are pretty weird too.

It's because we're not wearing masks.

00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,099
had a suit made for me.

328
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:51,772
I never got to wear it though.

329
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,734
Hold on! That's my suit.

330
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:56,615
And that's the money for my college.
Give that back!

331
00:16:58,661 --> 00:16:59,746
Got a problem with it?

332
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,839
[Tatsuya] So this time,
I'm making one with the money I made.

333
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,720
A nice one, tailor-made.

334
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:11,561
I ordered it, bought you presents,
then came home,

335
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:13,398
and you talk about Shingo.

336
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,410
So, you're absolutely right
about my look of, "Not again."

337
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,253
What's wrong with talking about him?

338
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,887
Am I not even allowed
to talk about Shingo?

339
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,432
That's not what I mean.

340
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,854
Other things come first.

341
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,526
First, we need to get on our feet again.

342
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,782
Then move to a bigger place.
Then Shingo can join us.

343
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,285
If we don't,

344
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,705
it'll just happen again.

345
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,090
You're…

346
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,516
so mean.

347
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,188
I know that!

348
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,442
But you see…

349
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:01,536
It's not that I hate Shingo.

350
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:06,045
What I hate is how you get so blinded
when it comes to Shingo.

351
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:08,257
When that happens…

352
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,892
I hate how I become.

353
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,395
Dang it!

354
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,361
This house is so dang small!

355
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:20,031
It's freakin' small!

356
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:23,706
There's nowhere to cool my head
after arguing with my mom!

357
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,085
[Tatsuya breathing heavily]

358
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:27,839
Tatsuya…

359
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,252
[Hansuke] Three weeks later,
Katsuko's aunt got out of the hospital.

360
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:51,385
USE WATER FROM THE OUTDOOR FAUCET

361
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,682
[resident 5] Yeah, it's really delicious.

362
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,351
-Hello there.
-There you are.

363
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,690
[Hansuke] Katsuko became even busier.

364
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:01,740
Her aunt was ordered to stay
in bed for another month.

365
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:06,290
So Katsuko had to make
hospital food for her every day.

366
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,629
I'm so sorry.

367
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,304
I intended to come straight back to work.

368
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,518
But the doctor…

369
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,109
Overdoing it is the worst you can do.

370
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,617
Both medically and for efficiency.

371
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:31,591
Katsuko, you'd better hurry.

372
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:35,181
You need to pick up
her medicine by 5:00 p.m.

373
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,439
Right?

374
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:45,410
It's been years
since I was able to relax this much.

375
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:05,074
[laughing and chattering]

376
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:08,915
Is that what I think it is?

377
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,711
It's done!

378
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,840
The tailor-made suit. Show me.

379
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:15,930
-No way! No way!
-[Hansuke] Just let me see.

380
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,642
I've gotta show it to my mom.

381
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:20,188
Hey, mister full-timer. Let's drink!

382
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,275
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

383
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,614
-Cheers!
-Cheers! Cheers!

384
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:28,287
Oh no, Hatsu. This says "Strong."

385
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,456
Bring it on!

386
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:33,297
We'll see just who's stronger, dang it!

387
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,761
Have you even paid? I bet you haven't.

388
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,765
We'll pay after we drink, dang it.

389
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,727
Pay before you drink, dang it.

390
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:43,610
Maybe I'll buy some champagne today.

391
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:46,950
[Okabe exclaims]

392
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,714
It sure is unusual
for you to come to the shop, Katsuko.

393
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,222
What's up?

394
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,101
Running an errand?

395
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,573
I heard your aunt was discharged.

396
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:09,787
That's great. Have you put on some weight?

397
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,417
Sorry! That was rude, wasn't it?

398
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,630
Gee, I'm sorry.

399
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:17,343
The other day
I went to a department store.

400
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,389
Everyone in the city was wearing masks.

401
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:22,563
Everybody was wearing
the masks you fold, Katsuko.

402
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:26,487
When I saw that, it made me happy.

403
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:37,425
Is she okay?

404
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:41,726
I mean, she's slouching more than usual.

405
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:44,106
Really?

406
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:46,276
-You think so?
-Yeah.

407
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:03,979
I'm home.

408
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:47,440
I'M SORRY.

409
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:48,610
[Mrs. Yoda] Ryu.

410
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:53,536
Turn around and face me.

411
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:55,666
I've gotta fix this.

412
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,468
[somber music]

413
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:03,932
[Mrs. Yoda] Okay, let's go.

414
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,835
KANEHIRA BATH

415
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:22,051
Unbelievable!
How come I didn't notice sooner?

416
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,143
No point in hiding it.

417
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:28,355
Who was it, Katsuko?

418
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:33,867
Who was it?

419
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,553
[Hansuke] Katsuko

420
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:45,347
was pregnant.

421
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,813
[somber music continues]

422
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,284
[doorbell rings]

423
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,205
[Okabe] Liquor Shop Okabe.

424
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,334
I've got a delivery.

425
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:08,937
[resident 6] Did you hear?
A young lady's been visiting Hansuke.

426
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,943
[resident 7] Naughty boy! But that's
not all. Katsuko's gonna have a kid.

427
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,072
[resident 6] That crushed Ganmodoki?
Naughty girl!

428
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:16,744
[resident 7] And that goofy liquor
shop kid's started playing guitar.

429
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:18,540
-No way!
-[resident 6] This town's going nuts.

430
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,000
What's the world coming to?
