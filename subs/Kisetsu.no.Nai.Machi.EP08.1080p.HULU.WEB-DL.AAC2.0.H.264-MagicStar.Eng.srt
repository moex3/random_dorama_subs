00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,042
"Café de Station"?
What language is "station"?

6
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:43,879
[resident] It means "station" in French.

7
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,844
-[residents] Really?
-[Yoshie] Do we need a cafe here?

8
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:50,893
-There's not even a dollar store.
-We need a dollar store more than a cafe.

9
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:53,106
-Or a Donki.
-Or a net cafe.

10
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:57,197
TENYA. I'd go there every day.

11
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,078
Not a TENYA. They're my competitor.

12
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:01,790
Yamada Udon.

13
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:04,170
With a net cafe on the second floor.

14
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,380
KUSHIKATSU TANAKA.

15
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,217
Like I said, not fried food.

16
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,763
Something besides fried food.

17
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:13,021
What's the point of a fancy cafe
when we don't even have Yamada Udon.

18
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,148
Who needs fancy?

19
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,695
To hear these unreserved opinions of yours

20
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:20,828
is why we're having
a community meeting next month.

21
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,085
Please attend this time.

22
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,422
[residents] Huh? A community meeting?

23
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:28,594
What's that all about?

24
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:29,930
What's that for?

25
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,265
[Yoshie] Oh, don't!

26
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,646
[resident 1] Don't bother them.

27
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,733
-[resident 2] Get back over here.
-[Mitsuyo] Don't go.

28
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:36,985
[Tatsuya] Oh, Hansuke.

29
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:39,365
Wanna drink?

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,789
-[resident 1] Oh my!
-[Mitsuyo] She came out.

31
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:43,874
[Tatsuya] Huh?

32
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,053
Hello.

33
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:54,646
So, that's what's up, Hansuke?

34
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,274
No, it's not like that.

35
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:58,904
[Mitsuyo] "Like that"? Like what?

36
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:02,787
[Hansuke] Our relationship
isn't what you all think it is.

37
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:06,837
Really? But your prefab
sure was doin' a lot of shakin'!

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,214
[residents cackling]

39
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,845
[Hansuke] Cut out that vulgar laugh.

40
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:14,978
But you were really gettin' it on
in the middle of the day.

41
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,063
[residents laugh]

42
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:19,153
Okay, I think I'll be going.

43
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:21,199
-[Hansuke] No, it's--
-Bye.

44
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,203
[Hansuke] Sorry.

45
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,712
Wanna come inside?

46
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:28,964
[Tatsuya] No, I'll go home.

47
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,595
How come?
You finished work, so let's drink.

48
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:35,101
Mom's getting dinner ready for me.

49
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,439
-[Hansuke] I see.
-Maybe another time.

50
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,117
The community meeting, right? Got it.

51
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,245
Bye.

52
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:46,457
[resident 1] Hurry up and go after her.

53
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,546
-[resident 2] What're you waitin' for?
-[resident 3] Get goin'!

54
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:49,631

00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,600
Naw, that's kinda creepy.

[receptionist] Here is the bill
for today's visit.

63
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,590
It comes to 8,060 yen.

64
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:33,301
You've gotta be kidding.

65
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,142
Week nine? That was two months ago
when I was in the hospital.

66
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:40,733
That bastard of a husband. How disgusting!

67
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:43,279
I hope the scumbag goes to hell.

68
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:44,574

71

There's no point in getting mad at you.

73
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:00,271
We made it.

00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,111
We made it, Beyonce.

75
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,452
Beyonce, you sure have grown.

00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:12,714
Tora.

79
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,303
You know what? I think it's time to go.

80
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:18,349
[Tora] No, it's not!

00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:22,525
-You tryin' to get rid of me?
-Feel that nice breeze, Tora?

[quirky music]

Tora, the weather's really great.

[Tora] Huh? What's with that?

85
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,875
You want me outta here?

86
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,294
No way!

87
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:35,008
-Why don't you people leave?
-Go, go, go, go.

00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:36,135
Go, Tora.

89
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:37,764
[Misao] That shop clerk's back.

90
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,224
That's his ex-girlfriend.

91
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,897
The embers have caught fire again.

92
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,445
-Huh? What's that mean?
-A flame lit once burns again easily.

93
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:47,324
Look. They kicked out the cats.

94
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:48,577
[resident] Poor things.

95
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,913
[residents] Poor things.

96
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,833
[Kuniko] They even kicked out the cats.

97
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,461
[Yoshie] Why can't they leave them be?

98
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,551
They told us to get out.

99
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:59,389
[residents] Those poor things.

100
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,728
Those two are so naughty.

101
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:05,736
By the way, did he give her
that present? The white cardigan.

102
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:07,155
Okabe?

103
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,368
I'm not sure.

104
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:13,961
My manager's such an a-hole.

105
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:16,465
Where I work now.

106
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:19,514
Is that so?

107
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,394
Yeah. A total a-hole.

108
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,695
I blocked them on LINE,
so they cleared out my locker.

109
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:27,864
What?

110
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:29,868
What an a-hole.

111
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,078
I know, right?

112
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,332
A-hole.

113
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,504
[Hansuke] She's always had a foul mouth.

114
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,134
So she comes over and spills

115
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:39,386
all her complaints.

116
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,850
Then goes home once she feels better.

117
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,649
I'll bring you a coffee maker next time.

118
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,906
[Hansuke] I've been accumulating
lots of appliances lately.

119
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,078
So it's not like
the gossiping housewives think?

120
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:53,289
No.

121
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,588
We both hate the same things.

122
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,717
The food we dislike,

123
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,721
and TV shows we dislike,

124
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:03,184
and people we dislike,
are almost all the same.

125
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:06,065
We started dating
because we had such fun complaining.

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,902
That's rare.

127
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:10,616
Isn't it usually that way?

128
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,166
It's a lot more fun
to talk about the stuff you dislike

129
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,836
than the stuff you like.

130
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,299
We can build trust too.

131
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,596
[Mikki] You should get back together.

132
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,015
No.
[chuckles]

133
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,519
I bet she wants to.

134
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,188
No, she doesn't.

135
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,986
I was awful to her.

136
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,535
FOUR YEARS EARLIER

137
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,123
Guess who is pregnant.

138
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:42,262
[Hansuke] We lived together,
so I thought it might happen eventually.

139
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,769
But when it did,
I so totally lost my cool.

140
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:49,861
It's only at times like that when things
like The What and my dead family

141
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,698
-go through my mind.
-[mumbles]

142
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,664
-I need to do things right.
-Wait. Hold on.

143
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:59,046
-I need to do right by you.
-Beyonce.

144
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:02,469
-And do right by Beyonce too.
-It's the cat.

145
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,058
-The cat?
-She's pregnant.

146
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,143
[Tora meows]

147
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:08,355
Sorry.

148
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:16,163

-[Beyonce meowing]

[Tora and Beyonce mumbling, meowing]

151
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,427
-Sorry.
-[wheezing laugh]

152
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:25,557
The cat? The cat?

153
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,060
[laughs]

154
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,816
I totally thought…
[cackles]

155
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,822
After that, it was awkward being together.

156
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:34,700
And that's why you escaped here.

157
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,002
Please don't tell Tatsuya and Okabe.

158

[doorbell rings]

159
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,342
Liquor Shop Okabe.

160
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:47,768
Okabe here.

161
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,949
[Okabe] I'm here for the empty bottles.

162
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:56,661
[Taeko] Okay.

163
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:00,544
[Kyota] You don't have to announce it.

Katsuko.

165
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:08,685
Sorry, but can you go to the market
in Nakamachi and buy leeks?

166
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,961
And a Sasagawa yokan.

167
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:24,299
[Kyota] Yokan?

168
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:29,434
I wonder why women always want
to eat all that extra sugar.

What'll we do?

173
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,258
Let her have it, or abort it?

174
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:52,146
Oh!
[chuckles]

175
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,608
Working remotely again today?

176
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:57,490
Sorry, but my brother is so noisy,
I can't concentrate at home.

177
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,745
I don't mind. Take it easy.

-Sure.

Huh?

I bet you suspect me,
but I swear I didn't do it.

187
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,218
What I want to know is
what we'll do with it. That's all.

188
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,224
Of course.
We'll figure out who did it later.

189
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:35,149
That's exactly why I'm denying it.
I swear it wasn't me.

Though we're not blood relatives,

she's still my niece…

193
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:42,205
"Munch munch"?

194
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:45,461
An uncle and niece would never…
Enough of your munching!

195
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:49,219
-Should we let her have it?
-There's no way we can.

196
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,181
She's still a child.

-Ethically, in fact, forensically, it's--
-Talk in a way I can understand.

Abort it, right?

00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:01,619
How can you be so vulgar?

200
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,502
That's right! If you want to
say it like those supermarket tabloids do.

201
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:07,171
We don't have the money.

[scoffs]
Now it's a financial problem?

203
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,348
We'll have to borrow from my sister.

204
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:16,774
You'd better believe it.
She's Katsuko's real mother, after all.

Katsuko is…

210

in really bad shape.

211
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,604
Please come with me to the liquor shop.

[Hansuke] That night,
when her aunt Taeko came home,

222
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,571
her uncle Kyota had been drinking.

223
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,073
What's the situation?

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,039
Did Katsuko really stab
the boy from the liquor shop?

225
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:32,759
You went to the hospital, right?
How's the boy?

226
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,599
I'll tell you in a sec.

227
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,395
I've been thinking about it.

228
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:44,867
If Katsuko really did stab that boy,
there's only one reason why.

229
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,581
I bet you agree.

230
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:48,833
There's only one reason.

231
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,379
-That boy--
-Okabe.

232
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,467
That Okabe,

233
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:58,018
he's the one who did that to Katsuko.
Right?

234
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,024
[Taeko slurping]

235
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:02,360
Amazing.

236
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:05,282
Your own niece

237
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:11,671
went and stabbed someone, but still,
you want to satisfy your hunger.

238
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,639
Before a woman worries
about psychological matters,

239
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:20,145
she's always thinking
about physical needs.

240
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:24,404
Okabe says he didn't do it.

241
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,993
[Taeko slurping]

242

I love Katsuko.

244
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,386
So it made me sad.

245
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:41,187
She works so hard that she looks like
she could collapse any second,

246
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:44,026
but still, people call her a rotten--

249
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:53,755
So I gave her eclairs and ice cream bars,

250
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,802
and ate them with her,

251
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:01,645
while I asked her riddles
or we played word games.

252
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,528
She must have hated that.

253
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:10,370
Well, you were awfully zealous,
but not enough to make her stab him.

00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,751
-That's right. Ow!
-Sorry.

255
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,717
She must have thought I'd done something
that someone else had done to her.

256
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:20,265
Even if it was a mistake,
a crime is still a crime.

257
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,523
[Hansuke] Will she go to prison?

258
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,238
The punishment won't be light.

259
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,829
[detective] It's different though
if you don't press charges, Mr. Okabe.

260
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,373
I won't press charges.

261
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:34,545
I mean, I know she didn't mean it.

262
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:40,013
[Hansuke] The police detective told
Katsuko's aunt exactly what Okabe said.

263
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:44,898
See? He's only saying that
because he's guilty.

264
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:45,984
Isn't that right?

That boy's digging his own grave.

267
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,541
They say the man who did it

268
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,421
can be charged with assault
and forced intercourse.

269
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:59,093
That's for sure.

270
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,765
He's the victim before the perpetrator.

271
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:05,188
The police told me
that you should turn yourself in.

272
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,109
Apparently,

273
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:10,533
Katsuko has something she wants to
tell the police with you there.

274
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:15,877
If you don't turn yourself in,
they say they'll come and take you in.

275
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,672
You've gotta be kidding!

276
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:18,799
Why me?

277
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,137
What proof do they have that I…

278
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,099
How should I know?

279
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,272
When she heard that Okabe didn't die,

280
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,947
she said she had something to say
and wanted you to come.

281
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:31,659
It's a lie.

282
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,246
It sounded like

283
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,252
the police had already heard
what she had to say.

284
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,340
Lies! Lies! All lies!

285
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,219
Taken in by the police?

286
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:42,639
That's absurd!

287
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:44,350
I swear I'll fight this!

288
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,270
[Taeko] What's the matter?

289
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,358
Are you saying Katsuko's lying?

290
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:52,199
Then quit getting so worked up.

291
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,328
Just go to the police and talk to them.

292
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:57,167
I'm not the least bit afraid of
the darn police.

[Kyota] Darn that filthy hussy!
How dare she bite the hand that feeds her!

294
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,516
They can't prove it.

295
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:05,685
You know why?

296
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:08,858
Because it's a lie.

297
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,655
[Hansuke] Her uncle Kyota gulped down
the last of the liquor,

298
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:15,120
dashed out of the house, and disappeared.

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,213
A few days later, they caught up to him
when he tried to sell the masks for money.

Welcome.

304
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,106
[Hansuke] He said
that he wouldn't press charges,

305
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,695
but Katsuko was held
in custody for two months,

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,785
and got an abortion
at the police hospital.

[resident 3] Why a dollar store?

324
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,676
[Misao] 'Cause everything's a dollar.

325
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,304
[resident 4]
Walmart's got too much stuff.

326
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,141
[resident 5] That's right. It's crazy.

327
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,895
[resident 6] That's what's good about it.

328
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:32,650
Sorry about complaining all the time.

329
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:33,736
It's okay.

[Hansuke] Mm?

332
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,625
…isn't there anything that gets you mad?

333
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,258
You can tell me.

334
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,264
I'll listen.

335
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,479
Right?

336
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,943
There's nothing really.

337
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:57,951
That can't be true,
especially living here.

338
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,581
Isn't there someone you dislike?

339
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:04,756
No, there isn't.

340
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,891
Since I came here,
most everything is funny, so I don't mind.

341
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:13,691
Does it mean you've become optimistic?

342
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:19,744
When I became pessimistic about
how pessimistic I am,

343
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:22,917
I must have ended up becoming optimistic.

344
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:26,967
I'm glad to hear it.

345
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,762
Yeah.

346
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:34,481
Bye.

347
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,836
[Hansuke] After that,
she stopped showing up.

348
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,317

349
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,249
You're back.

350
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,963
Why didn't you come and see me?

351
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,854
I don't really get it.

352
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:19,531
Why did you do that?

353
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,256
[Katsuko] I'm sorry.

354
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:31,303
[Okabe] No, I'm not angry.

355
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:34,519
I just want to know why.

356
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:41,198
I intended to die.

357
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,618
Huh?

358
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,163
You did?

359
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,670
Huh? That makes no sense.

360
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:53,181
If you wanted to die,
what's the point of stabbing me?

361
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:57,774
I don't know how to put it.

362
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,742
I don't understand it myself.

363
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:06,791
But…

364
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,631
I was afraid.

365
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,510
Afraid?

366
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,728
When I thought I would die…

367
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:23,282
I was afraid
that you would forget about me.

368
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,959
After I died,

369
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:33,302
I was sure you'd soon forget me.

370
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,641
That scared me.

371
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:41,611
Being forgotten by you…

372
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:46,453
frightened me so badly,
I couldn't stand it.

373
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:53,342
I still don't really understand.
