00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:03,423
A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

2
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:07,389
[Hansuke] Tanba-san's place is
at the far end of the town.

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:09,101
TANBA

4
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:10,980
His door is never locked.

5
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:13,109
His place is pure Japanese style.

6
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:16,241
It's small,
but there's even an elevated alcove.

7

EPISODE 9
TANBA-SAN

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,334
Welcome.

10
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:26,010
[Hansuke]
All the residents rely on Tanba-san.

11
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,429
You're first.

12
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,271
Lately, Hatsu's been kinda distant.
[sighs]

13
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:33,233
You think he and my wife…

14
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:34,736
[Hansuke] When faced with problems.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,451
I accidentally dropped
Masuo's favorite sunglasses in the toilet.

16
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:39,621
-[chuckles]
-[Hansuke] At happy times.

17
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:43,253
Roku-chan's found something
he likes more than trains.

18
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,424
-Power shovels.
-[Hansuke] At sad times.

19
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,261
My filling fell out again.

20
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:48,764
[Hansuke] When irritated.

21
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,643
I love her so much, I can't sleep.

22
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:53,189
I want to see her so badly, I tremble.

23
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:54,943
Have you felt like that?

24
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:58,283
-[Hansuke] Or when they just want to talk.
-Are you okay?

25
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:02,709
I've been council president for 13 years,
and now I've finally found love.

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,923
You're single?

27
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:10,683
Everyone calls me "council president".
I bet they don't even know my name.

28
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,188
Do you know my name, Tanba-san?

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,484
Council president.

30
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:18,365
She called me by my name from the start.

31
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:20,953
[council president]
She was a news anchor in Saga or Oita,

32
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,456
-and is Miss Dekopon.
-[wailing in distance]

33
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,961
She led a sheltered life,
so she had to use a dating app--

34
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:27,257
-Shush!
-[rattling in distance]

35
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:30,055
[council president]
What is it? What happened?

36
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:31,558
[resident 1] Same as always.

37
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:34,021
Kuma's gotten drunk
and is going on a rampage.

38
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,819
-[Kuma groans]
-[Hansuke] He's got a sword!

39
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,908
It's the great Muramasa sword,
a memento of his grandpa.

40
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,622
-[resident 2] Watch out!
-[residents screaming]

41
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,878
[resident 3] What's happening?
What's going on?

42
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:47,757
[resident 4] Watch out!

43
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,763
It ain't no lie!

44
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:53,894
I killed a guy with this
and went to prison for it!

45
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:56,399
-Why'd he get like this?
-His hamster died.

46
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:59,573
His hamster? Hamsters die all the time!

47
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:00,992
It was suicide.

48
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,912
-[Hansuke] The hamster killed itself?
-Mm. Mm.

49
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:06,085
It was so stressed out
that it jumped into Kuniko's frying oil.

50
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,589
-Kuma!
-[residents yelp, whimper]

51
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:10,887
I know it's difficult,
but you must give it a proper burial.

52
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,557
-[resident 1] What's that?
-Ham Cutlet.

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,101
"Ham Cutlet"?

54
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:17,024
-[screams]
-[resident 2] Watch out, Tanba-san!

55
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,819
[resident 3] Watch out, Tanba-san!

56
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,197
Outta my way, gramps!

57
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,996
Outta my way or I'll slice you up!

58
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:28,379
Want me to take over?

59
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:31,135
[breathing heavily]
Huh? What?

60
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:36,062
I'll take over for you.
It's too much for you to handle alone.

61
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,107
I'll take over for you.

62
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,121
[Kuma breathing heavily]

63
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,556
[Tanba-san] It's all right now.

64
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,977
It's all over.

65
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,693
[residents murmuring]

66
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,283
[Yoshie]
Oh, so that's what it was all about.

67
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,955
I thought Tanba-san
had struck a nerve or something.

68
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:10,673
When he said he'd take over…
[sniffles]

69
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,469
It wasn't like I was pounding mochi.

70
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:16,768
I couldn't just say,
"Go ahead. Thank you."

71
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,112
I mean,
I lost my temper and flew into a rage.

72
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,245
To be honest,
I didn't know how to control my feelings.

73
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,047
It felt like he understood
what I was going through.

74
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:33,677
[Kuma] I was so ashamed.

75
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:37,351
-[resident 1] It's Tanba-san.
-[resident 2] Hello.

76
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,522
[resident 3] Who is Tanba-san anyway?

77
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:42,194
Rumor is he was handsome
when he was young.

78
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:43,989
One of those flashy street dancers
in Harajuku.

79
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:47,162
[resident 4] Wasn't he a Tokyo Olympic
torch bearer in the '64 Olympics?

80
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:50,043
How old is Tanba-san anyway?

81
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,799
62?

82
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:54,886
Or is it 63?

83
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,182
It says you were born in Showa Era 24.

84
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:00,480
Is that right? So, how old am I?

85
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,944
Your blood pressure is normal.

86
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:04,279
How are you feeling?

87
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:05,700
Pretty good.

88
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:08,539
I'm glad you come every month, Hattori.

89
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:12,003
It must be hard to get comfortable
living in temporary housing.

90
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,886
No. I'm just killing time until I die now.

91
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,099
What'll you do about your coffin?

92
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,978
You can't lay one down in here.

93
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,443
If I can't lie down in it, I'll sit in it.

94
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,198
I'll grasp my knees like this.
[chuckles]

95
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,537
This is the Recovery Public Housing.

96
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,292
The elderly get priority for moving in.

97
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,423
No, thanks. I'm still only 62.

[Tanba-san] It's not in there.

103
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:22,854
Those are my work tools and porn videos.

104

[rattling]

105
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,991
If you want money, it's over here.

106
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,253
This is all I've got now.

107
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,469
My pension arrives
at the end of the month.

108
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:41,600
Come back then. Oh.

109
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:45,064
You can have these too.

110
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,820
Come in the front next time.

111
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:50,366
That way is much less suspicious.

112
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,247
[playful music]

113
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,753
Take care.

[Roku-chan] Hey! You thieving cat!

You're hard at work, Roku-chan.

119
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,596
Yeah.

120
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,432
It's the end of the fiscal year.

121
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,395
Construction jobs are backed up.

122

Liquor Shop Okabe…

00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,454
Okabe here!

125
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,849
I'm ready.

126

[Okabe chuckles softly, squeals]

127
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:51,238
Oh, my. I like it. Is that your twin look?

128
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,827
It's called coordinated outfits, Auntie.

129
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,248
-[Taeko] I ain't your auntie.
-[awkward chuckle]

130
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,419
See you later.

131
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,006
See you.

132
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,766
[calm music]

133
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,419
You're first.

134
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:24,972
Everything in my life sucks.

135
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,611
I can't take it.

136
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:37,623
My life is totally over.
[sighs]

137
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:43,969
I want to start all over again.

138
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,522
I haven't seen your mom lately.

139
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:50,941
She left.

140
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,110
Huh?

141
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:56,201
When she heard Shingo was getting out
of the hospital, she got restless.

142
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,249
She took my little brother and sister
and left.

143
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,675
I'm living alone
in that three-room prefab.

144
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:06,890
Is that right?

145
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:11,566
Sorry that I didn't notice.

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,279
Everyone's got
their own troubles to deal with.

147
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:21,753
Shima-san's been good to me,
so I might become a full-time employee.

148
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:24,049
I had a suit made,

149
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,098
but when I came home to show it to Mom,
the place was empty.

150
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:30,729
I'll never be able to wear a suit.

151
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,031
The one my second dad had made,

152
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,828
Shingo took it from me.

153
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:43,880
Shingo takes everything I love
just when things are looking up.

154
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,678
But you're a sensible man.

155
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,558
It's enough to destroy my confidence.

156
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,982
I worked hard.

157
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,739
I wanted the four of us
to move out of here

158
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:00,789
and live in a three-bedroom place
that's not a prefab.

159
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,674
I guess…

160
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:10,141
that's not what Mom wanted.

161
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,938
[indistinct chatter]

162
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,654
[employee] Please think about it.

163
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:18,658
[Mrs. Yoda] Excuse me.

164
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,704
Are there wheelchair-accessible rooms
in this apartment?

165
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:22,833
[employee] Yes. Please look at this.

166
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,547
-Here you go.
-[Shingo] Wow.

167
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,467
-See? Look how huge it is.
-[somber music]

168
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,553
[employee] Here.

169
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,974
[Shingo] Yeah. Akane, you'll be in charge.

170
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:33,980
-We'll come by and check it out.
-Great.

171
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,942
-[employee] I look forward to seeing you.
-[Ryu] Thank you.

172
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,445
[Shingo] This is good news.

173
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,491
[Mrs. Yoda] Let's go, Akane.

174
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:42,998
Let's go. I can hardly wait to see it.

175
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,378
-[Mrs. Yoda] How about Sunday?
-[Shingo] Sounds good.

176
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,050
-[Mrs. Yoda] Wanna see it?
-[Shingo] Yeah. Looks good.

177
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,223
She wanted to live
with everyone else except me.

178
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,853
[inhales deeply]

179
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:57,318
Mom hated me.
[sighs]

180
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:02,286
She should have told me.

181
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,544
I would have gotten out of her life.

182
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:08,465
You shouldn't think like that.

183
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,639
You're about to become
a full-time employee.

184
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,020
[Tanba-san] What's wrong?

185
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,448
[Hamaguchi]
Illegal occupation, subletting,

186
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,619
and malicious use has run rampant,

187
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,623
causing trouble for local authorities.

188
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,005
So final discussions
to clear out the place are going to begin.

189
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:31,303
There are 15 households still remaining.

190
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:33,348
Our goal is to clear them out by March.

191
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,186
Get serious.

192
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,440
[Hamaguchi] It's not a goal.
It's imperative.

193
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:38,651
Isn't that right, Shima-san?

194
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:44,622
Well, the government originally offered
to provide the housing for two years,

195
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,836
but it's been 13 years now.

196
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,846
-Right.
-[Tatsuya] Before I knew it,

197
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,602
I was in charge of the project
to clear people out.

198
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,729
OCCUPIED TEMPORARY HOUSING

199
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:01,196
[Tatsuya] We'll be holding discussions
with each household to get out by March.

200
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,952
[somber music]

201
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,837
[Tanba-san]
I guess our time really is up now.

202
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:14,013
They never intended to build
a café in the first place.

203
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,480
I could never kick people out.

204
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:21,069
I love everyone here.

205
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:24,618
Roku-chan and Hatsu and Masuo

206
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:27,874
and Katsuko and Kuma
and of course you, Tanba-san.

207
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,878
I know nobody has anywhere to go.

208
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,634
Wait…

209
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,767
I don't have anywhere to go either!
[breathes heavily]

210
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,109
I even went and saved all that money
to move into a condo.

211
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,950
[voice breaking]
I'm such a loser.

212
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,165
[sniffles]

213
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:52,674
[in normal voice]
Therefore, I came here today…

214
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,513
to tell you goodbye.

215
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:00,774
Dying here would only cause
everyone here trouble,

216
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:03,403
so tonight,
I will jump in front of a train.

217
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:05,491
[breathes deeply]

218
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,328
Thank you for all your help.

219
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:09,708
[Tanba-san] Hold on a minute.

220
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,683
[rustling]

221
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,070
Wolfsbane.

222
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:28,036
[Tanba-san]
You know it, right? It's deadly poisonous.

223
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,671
If you eat a gram of its root,
you'll die for sure.

224
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,762
If you're serious about dying,
then this is the best way to do it.

225
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:43,358
Don't you dare go dying
where nobody can see you.

226
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,697
You're not a cat.

227
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,957
Everyone should be made aware of…

228
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:56,886
why a fine young man like yourself
decided to die.

229
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,810
If they don't, there'd be no point.

230
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,908
How long before I die?

231
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,327
It's quick.

232
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,247
You won't even suffer.

233
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,216
Should I take it all?

234
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,468
Yes, that would guarantee…

235
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:20,140
[gasps]
What?

236
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,691
-[groans]
-How do you feel?

237
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,285
How do I put this?

238
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:34,168
There's a kind of earthy smell.

239
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:35,797
[retches]

240
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,847
If there's anyone you want to see,
you should see them.

241
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,851
Huh? What?

242
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,480
There's time for that?
[breathes heavily]

243
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:46,067
-You should lie down.
-Huh?

244
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,113
Wait. What?

245
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:54,041
SHINSHINMARU 88

246
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,755
[Tanba-san] How are you feeling?

247
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:57,924
Well…

248
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:00,763
Hansuke.

249
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,182
[Tanba-san] Hansuke?

250
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:07,944
I can't believe
I forgot to mention their names earlier.

251
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,490
Hansuke and Okabe.

252
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,829
-Want me to get them?
-It's okay.

253
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:16,294
I don't want them to watch me die.

254
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,762
[Tatsuya exhales slowly]

255
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,895
Now I can see Dad.

256
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,651
The one who made your suit?

257
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,990
Not that one. The first one.

258
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,833
My real dad who died in The What.

259
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,633
-For some reason, lately…
-[indistinct chatter]

260
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,512
-…he's been in my dreams.
-[soft music]

261
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:44,977
[Tatsuya] Only Dad…

262
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,439
You did great! This is amazing!

263
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,653
…ever said, "You're doing good.

264
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,493
You're amazing."

265
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,834
It's kind of weird,

266
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,130
but, like we're friends,

267
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:02,052
we drink,

268
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:04,473
and we talk…

269
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,273
in my dreams.

270
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:16,205
That's only possible while you're alive.

271
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,168
Huh?

272
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,215
Your father exists in your mind.

273
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:26,769
Therefore, your father only lives
while you're alive.

274
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:29,775
And if I die?

275
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:34,492
[Tanba-san] He'll disappear.
When you go, he goes too.

276
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:38,416
[gasps]

277
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,170
[sharp gasp]
How long has it been?

278
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,468
Only about five minutes have passed.
What's wrong?

279
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:45,097
[retches, coughs]

280
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,854
-That's a vase.
-Don't you have something?

281
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:51,944
-Like what?
-Don't you have something for this?

282
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:55,075
You mean an antidote?
Are you sure? You won't be able to die.

283
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,369
I don't want to die!

284
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:58,791
I don't want to die! Hurry!

285
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,797
-[Tanba-san] Uh, just a minute.
-[grunting]

286
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,801

-[breathes heavily, retches]
-[clattering]

288
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,401
HELP!

289
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:13,779
[Tatsuya] What are you doing?

290
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:15,825
-Take some Seirogan.
-What?

291
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,329
Are you insane, you geezer!
You wanna kill me?

292
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:19,916
[Hansuke] Tatsuya! What's wrong?

293
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,339
-Did you eat vinegared mackerel?
-[Tatsuya breathing heavily]

294
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:25,845
Don't touch me! Why did you come?

295
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:26,930
You called for me!

296
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,853
That's no reason to come!
[breathing heavily]

297
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:32,357
Hansuke, what's the antidote
for wolfsbane?

298
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,153
Wolfsbane? Wolfsbane?

299
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:35,781
-It's too late.
-There isn't one.

300
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,619
-[screams]
-I typed in "wolfsbane antidote",

301
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,246
but it said "none".

302
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,752
-We have to pump his stomach.
-Pump his stomach?

303
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,423
Oh, no. When I typed in "pump stomach",
it says "hell".

304
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:46,762
-[retching]
-Pull yourself together, Tatsuya!

305
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,016
What's wrong? Vinegared mackerel?

306
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,101
Wolfsbane.

307
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,231
Thank goodness.
I thought he got a parasite.

308
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:53,609
[both] It's not okay!

309
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,070
Why'd you eat wolfsbane?

310
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:57,449
-Leave me be!
-Huh?

311
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,746
Hurry up and tell them!

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,587
Tell them someone's gonna die!
[breathing heavily]

313
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,302
[Tatsuya]
This is a list of all the residents left

314
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,429
in temporary housing.

315
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,977
In the "reported by" column,

316
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,939
that's your name, isn't it?

317
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:14,943
Shinsuke Tanaka!

318

[Okabe] What do you mean?

00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,661
[Tatsuya] He's a spy.

320
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,548
He's been reporting everything
he learns about us to them for money.

321
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,764
What? Hansuke was?

322
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,267
Is that true?

323
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,816
When I told him about the homeless,

324
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:39,033
the next day, those workers came in
and tore down their cardboard house.

325
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:42,331
Right around then,
this guy bought a rice cooker.

326
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:45,546
[Tatsuya] How do you feel about that?

327
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:47,842
What do you mean?

328
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,055
Don't you feel guilty?

329
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:53,520
[Tatsuya] With the money you made
from destroying someone's home,

330
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:55,273
you made some nice rice

331
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,112
and ate it with your cat!

332
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,785
I didn't think about
the consequences then.

333
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,707
I just reported what I was told to.

334
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,128
In fact, the guy who hired me didn't care.

335
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:08,132
And the guy who hired him is Shima-san.

336
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:09,678
What do you mean?

337
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:12,391
[Hansuke]
Mikki and Shima-san are in cahoots.

338
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:13,977
Look!

339
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,898
[Okabe] The dolphin mark.

340
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:20,156
The dolphin mark is on the bags
of masks you carry every day, Katsuko.

341
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,369
They're all subsidiaries of No Season.

342
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:24,707
-What?
-Report to them.

343
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:25,876
Now!

344
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:30,051
Tatsuya Yoda was abandoned
by his family and drank poison.

345
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:31,638
One more place is empty!

346
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,851
-I will not!
-Why not?

347
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,773
Because your story doesn't make money.

348
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,990
I reported it, but I didn't make a dime.

349
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:44,329
Your story got me five napa cabbages.

350
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:47,335
But you're still my precious friend.

351
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:51,553
-Tatsuya!
-Tatsuya!

352
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:52,972
Katsuko, get some water.

353
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,477
[Tatsuya] Oh, no. I'm blacking out.
[breathes heavily]

354
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:58,692
No, I don't want to die.

355
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:01,197
That's right. It'd be stupid to die!

356
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,829
Selling out my friend
for five napa cabbages wasn't worth it,

357
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:08,127
so I quit doing it.
That's why Shima-san came here himself.

358
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,423
You've gotta be kidding!

359
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,264
That's a pretty lame friendship!

360
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,647
-I'm sorry!
-That won't cut it!

361
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:20,861
You're short on brains, Hansuke!

362
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:24,661
It's your fault that I was put in charge
of clearing people out!

363
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:25,746
Ow! Ow! Ow!

364
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,710
-Tatsuya, don't die!
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

365
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:31,758
[Hansuke] Throw up!

366
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,098
[Tatsuya] I can't take anymore!

367
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,726
[Hansuke] Throw up!

368
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,398
[Okabe] Katsuko,
this isn't the time for that.

369
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,901
I don't wanna die!
[sobs]

370
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:44,032
-I don't wanna die!
-[Hansuke] Throw up, Tatsuya!

371
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,871
-What's that about hyacinth?
-[Tatsuya whimpering]

372
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:48,457
Hyacinth?

373
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,919
Hyacinth.

374
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,590
Hyacinth…

375
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,134
Hyacinth.

376
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,848
[Katsuko] This is hyacinth.

377
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:56,933
[Tanba-san] Hyacinth?

378
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,229
It's not wolfsbane?

379
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,358
-[Katsuko] It's hyacinth.
-Hyacinth.

380
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:03,572
Hyacinth root?

381
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,370
Tanba-san!

382
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,502
[Tanba-san] Huh?

383
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,800
[comical music]

384
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:15,804
[Hansuke] Tatsuya's suicide attempt…

385
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:17,850
failed.

386
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,860
Did you have a fun date?

387
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:27,703
[soft chuckle]

388
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:30,458
Sorry.

389
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,045
SHINSHINMARU 88

390
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,924
[Hansuke] For a while after that,

391
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,554
their peaceful
yet boring daily lives continued.

392
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,103
It was only this big.

393
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,773
-[whistle blowing]
-That scared me.

394
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,902
Good morning, water-faucet ladies.

395
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:46,991
This is my sweet wife,
the council president's wife, Harumi.

396
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:50,624
It's nice to meet you.

397
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,714
Excuse me, please.

398
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:55,466
[exclaims, chuckles]

399
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,722
She is Miss Dekopon, after all.

400
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,015
Be kind to her.

401
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,938
She's my sheltered wife,
so I won't be letting her out much.

402
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:03,107
[hisses]

403
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,986
-Then leave her inside.
-[chuckles]

404
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:06,071
-[resident] That's right.
-[whistle blows]

405
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:09,662
[robber] I came inside here,
then opened that up.

406
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:14,212
But then he said
there's nothing there and got up

407
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:16,341
and gave me his wallet.

408
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,887
Did you hear that?

409
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,183
[Tanba-san] Nobody's that nice.

410
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:21,351
That's for sure.

411
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,063
He doesn't look rich either.

412
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:24,942
Hey, hold on here.

413
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:27,782
Try to remember what happened, mister.

414
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,161
You gave me the porn videos from there.

415
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:31,413
-[Tanba-san] Are you insane?
-[knocking on door]

416
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:34,294
[Hattori]
Hattori here from the Support Center.

417
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,589
TANBA

418
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:39,764
[employee] It's been a long time.

419

[grunts]
Lowering the arm.

420
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:50,118
It's the power shovel nut!

421
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,748
-[Shiro] It's the power shovel nut!
-[imitates engine whirring]

422
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:56,714
[Shima] We've met before,

423
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,094
but I'm Shima from No Season.

424
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:04,772
This March marks 13 years since The What.

425
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,695
[Shima] This is
the only temporary housing remaining.

426
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:10,534
[Hattori] The Recovery Public Housing
is right near here.

427
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:13,414
If everyone moves there together,
you won't be lonely.

428
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:18,090
Of course, wounds don't always heal
with the passing of time.

429
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:20,512
However, by having the courage

430
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,100
to look toward the future
and make a new start,

431
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:27,191
older people like you, Tanba-san,
can be an example to others.

432
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:31,366
[Shima] Then even if people can't forget
their pain, they can at least overcome it.

433
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,624
[Tanba-san] Silver is in trouble.

434
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:36,376
Excuse me?

435
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:38,673
[Tanba-san] That's Sankichi Sakata.

436
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,265
It's past the point of no return.

437
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:47,148
But you'll move it out of the way.

438
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:58,295
This might just change
how my life goes now.

439
00:22:58,337 --> 00:22:59,339
Thank you.

440

[wheezes, sneezes]

00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,140
Sorry.

442
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:11,614
All right.

443
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:15,539
I'll leave.
