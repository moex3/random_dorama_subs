SHINSHINMARU 88

2
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:08,141
[Hansuke] Tanba-san agreed to
the offer to move out.

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:09,561
Oh, Tanba-san.

4
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,189
-[Tanba-san] Hi.
-[chuckles]

5
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:13,569
Write something on it.

6
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:16,407
[news reporter 1] It's that time
of year again.

7
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,665
The day marking 13 years since The What.

8
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,417
At this temporary housing,

9
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:24,131
steps are being taken
to finally move everyone out.

10
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:26,177
Talks with residents are making progress.

11
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,597
SPECIAL REPORT
13 YEARS LATER, EVICTION TALKS BEGIN

12
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,687
Some of the residents
are set to move out today.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,068
-See you later. Bye.
-[Yoshie] Call us if you need anything.

14
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,364
Tora, get down, you dumb cat.

15
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:38,410
[breathing rapidly]

16
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:41,709
[meows]

17
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,213
-See you later.
-[Hansuke] Bye.

18
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:46,885
-Take care of yourself, Tanba-san.
-[Yoshie] See you around.

19
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:51,729
-Eat properly, Tanba-san.
-Goodbye, Tanba-san.

20
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,566
-See you.
-Bye.

21
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,370
Thirteen years, huh?

22
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,673
I've been here for exactly a year.

23
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:10,098
PLAYING SHOGI WITHOUT PAWNS
IS PLAYING A LOSING GAME OF SHOGI

24
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:12,645
[news reporter 2] Even now,
disaster victims are forced to live

25
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,190
destitute lives in temporary housing.

26
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,317
AT ITS PEAK, 30 FAMILIES LIVED HERE

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,363
Thirteen years after The What,

28
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:20,578
what are the residents thinking now?

29
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:23,458
[Hansuke] Tatsuya works with
an intermediary

30
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,130
going to each home making offers.

31
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:29,428
Neither the national nor local governments
can force you out.

32
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,852
But Tanba-san left.

33
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,313
What's Masuo saying?

34
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:36,902
[Igawa] Everyone receives
50,000 yen for vacating.

35
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:39,741
That's nothin'! It's only a month's rent
at the Recovery Public Housing.

36
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,285
And two masks.

37
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,789
[Mitsuyo] You can keep 'em!

38
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:48,592
We'll leave, if we can live
across from Hatsu in the new place.

39
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,347
It's not that nice?

40
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:54,646
I had a look inside,
but the shower pressure was weak.

41
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:58,027
-And the tatami mats were gaudy.
-And they want 50,000 yen for rent?

42
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,155
Good morning.

43
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:01,200
Hello.

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,954
You making progress?

45
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:05,835
Next, we've got a meeting
with the construction company.

46
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,047
There are a ton of issues.

47
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,509
We'll go to Building Four.

48
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:11,137
You sure better.

49
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,646
And I thought he was a nice guy.

50
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:18,193
Looks like it might rain today.

51
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,905
Too bad he's behind all of it.

52
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:21,742
Yeah.

53
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,750
A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

54
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,254
[Hansuke] The first one
who displayed opposition

55
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:30,091
was someone unexpected.

56
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,344
I can't do this.

57
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:34,726
I already barely make enough
to support a family of eight.

58
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,103
How could I pay rent?

59
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:41,698
Children are calculated at two-for-one,
so yours is a family of five.

60
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:42,825
Huh?

61
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:47,167
If you economize,
it's not an unreasonable amount to pay.

62
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,419
We'll assist you.

63
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:52,637
How dare you drop in all of a sudden
and tell us to leave this month.

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,433
Are you devils?
You may as well tell us to die.

65
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:59,149
[Igawa] The government provided
this interim housing as temporary relief

66
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,778
until families got on their feet.

67
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,576
Can't you see? We're not on our feet yet.

68
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,372
-Then quit having babies.
-Cut that out, Hamaguchi.

69
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:08,209
Sorry.

70
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:11,382
In this time of shrinking population,
I admire you.

71
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,719
But from our view--

72
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:15,015
-You understand how it is, right?
-Huh?

73
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,102
You support your mom and two siblings.

74
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,897
[Ryotaro] It's not easy, is it?

75
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:23,156
Actually… they all left.

76
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,534
You're kidding?

77
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,162
Got out early, huh?

78
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,709
You and your Young Men's Club,

79
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,548
you said you'll make us a cafe and stuff.

80
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:34,763
But now you're on their side,
pressuring us to get out.

81
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:35,973
You traitor!

82
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,854
Aren't you getting
child-support payments, ma'am?

83
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,106
Mikki.

84
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,574
[Mikki] I had you people investigated.

85
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,578
Tsutomu, Shiro. Go play outside.

86
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,498
[Mikki] They're not your kids, right?

87
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,335
Hey, cut that out.

88
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:54,301
Their real fathers are
all residents here, right?

89
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:57,600
-You're really something, ma'am.
-[Tatsuya] Cut it out!

90
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:01,817
If each of their fathers paid
10,000 yen a month,

91
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,946
you could pay that rent.

92
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:05,658
Right, Sprouts?

93
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,496
Are you deaf? Go play outside! Now!

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,125
They don't have to go.

95
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,343
I'm sure you kids know

96
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:19,476
who your real father is and who's a liar.

97
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,230
Isn't that right?

98
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:24,445
Ryoko, tell them your father's name.

99
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,494
Ryotaro Sawagami.

100
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,169
What? Are you kidding?
She's clearly half Japanese.

101
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:33,839
That Indian laborer's her dad.

102
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,760
Nobody asked you!

103
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,429
-[Tatsuya] Whoa, stop!
-Nobody asked you!

104
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:39,099
-Get out!
-[Hamaguchi] Stop it!

105
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:40,226
[Ryotaro] Get out right now!

106
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,523
[Mikki] I only addressed
the elephant in the room.

107
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:46,531
[Hansuke] That night, Misao Sawagami,
aka Sprouts,

108
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,831
left the town with just her baby.

109
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:58,889
[in Hindi]
Farewell.

110
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:03,147
[Hansuke in Japanese] The Immigration
Bureau arrested Ryoko's father

111
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:06,195
for the crime of illegal employment.

112
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:07,990
Farewell.

113
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,455
[in Hindi]
Farewell.

114
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:17,175
[in Japanese]
It's not your fault, Hansuke.

115
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,179
No, it definitely is.

116
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,560
[Tatsuya] Sooner or later,
it would've come out.

117
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:23,939
Just nobody ever told anyone.

118
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,364
You're wrong.
Staying silent is a great thing.

119
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:30,661
Ignoring it is kindness.

120
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,750
How can you stay silent?
People like Roku-chan and Kuma

121
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,132
and Sprouts aren't normal.
We want to talk about them.

122
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,386
And you'll get paid if you report it.

123
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,436
I was being arrogant.

124
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,025
Since I'm a good and proper person,

125
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,739
I can do whatever I want
to people who aren't.

126
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:50,784
I felt that way inside.

127
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:53,707
So I want to apologize to everyone.

128
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,047
Everyone? Who?

129
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,432
Everyone's gotta leave because of you!

130
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,146
Tanba-san,

131
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,359
and Hatsu and Masuo

132
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:08,987
and Roku-chan

133
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,824
and Katsuko.

134
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,922
Huh? Is that right, Katsuko?

135
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:26,021
That CEO's wife, her mom,
said she'll take her in for a while.

136
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:28,860
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:31,866
What are you apologizing for?

138
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,246
It is a shock though.

139
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:37,460
It's only a matter of time
before the complainers leave.

140
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:40,718
The ones who don't pay taxes,
the ones on welfare illegally.

141
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,847
Look and you'll find dirt on all of them.

142
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,686
That's why nobody talked.
Not because they're kind!

143
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,441
Why are they being kicked out?
What'll be built here?

144
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,863
[Shima] Memorial Stadium.

145
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,869
It'll open this summer.

146
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:56,081
We'll hold a festival
to celebrate the reconstruction.

147
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,208
NANI ROCK FES. 2024

148
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,920
[Okabe] That's really scuzzy.

149
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,175
The headliner will be Maximum the Hormone.

150
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:02,595
Wait. Hold on here.

151
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,768
This place is too small for a stadium.

152
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:11,236
[Shima] That's why it's being built on
the waterfront where access is better.

153
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,660
The performers' dressing rooms,
a parking lot,

154
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:17,165
and porta potties will be located here.

155
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:20,004
You don't need this space for that.
It could go anywhere!

156
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:26,183
Porta potties
and dressing rooms for a festival?

157
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,730
You're kicking everyone out for that?

158
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:33,322
Tanaka, I'll admit
that this is a nice place,

159
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,951
but it's not a utopia.

160
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:38,667

Tanba-san went to live in a nursing home.

You can't live here!

324
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,714
No! I like it here!

325
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:06,425
Why do you like it here?

326
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,764
It's where Mom and Dad met.

327
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,229
[emotional music]

328
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,941
[inaudible singing]

329
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,485
[inaudible cheering]

330
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:21,122
[Mariko] We were all born here.
This is all we know.

331
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,042
So we don't wanna go anywhere else.

332
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,342
Even if it is better than here,
I don't want us to split up!

333
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:32,185
We talked it over yesterday
and made up our minds to stay here!

334
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:33,939
Mariko…

335
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,068
I understand.

336
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,156
I understand how you feel.

337
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,623
This place is all I've got too.

338
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,671
My whole family died.

339
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,886
All I had was my cat when I came here.

340
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:51,015
And you know what?

341
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,812
My family abandoned me.

342
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,943
So we understand.

343
00:17:57,695 --> 00:18:01,620
It's called temporary housing,
but to all of you, it's not temporary.

344
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:06,462
But this doesn't involve Katsuko, right?

345
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:08,550
Yes, it does.

346
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,932
When we're hungry, we'll eat her.

347
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:13,351
-What?
-Eat her?

348
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,729
We won't eat her.

349
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:16,858
We're not going to eat her.

350
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:19,614
She meant to say
that we'll have her cook for us.

351
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,868
We're not going to split up.

352
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:25,835
You're lying! Now that Mom's gone,
if we're kicked outta here,

353
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,882
there's no way we'll be able
to live together again.

354
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:31,847
Yeah, if you weren't my children.

355
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,813
Of course,

356
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,694
I know I'm your father.

357
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:42,910
But if you don't believe that,

358
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:48,421
then have the man who you think is
your real father take care of you.

359
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:49,883
Hey!

360
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,887
What about you, Dad?

361
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,353
I'll have to live alone.

362
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:00,445
It's unfair to take care
of just one of you.

363
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:04,579
Either all together, or split up.

364
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:06,541
It's either one.

365
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,627
No!

366
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,379
No, no!

367
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:10,799
All together is best!

368
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,720
We're all your kids, Dad!

369
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,516
-[Tsutomu] Dad!
-[Mariko] Dad!

370
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,310
-Thank you, you guys.
-Dad!

371
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:18,356
Ryotaro Sawagami.

372
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:20,903
[Ryotaro] That's right. Ryotaro Sawagami.

373
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:28,125
What'll I do?
I don't wanna leave here either.

374
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,213
You've got no choice.

375
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,635
I doubt there's anywhere better than this.

376
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:37,018
-You've only been here a year.
-But I've gotta go, right?

377
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,398
Yep.

378
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:43,072
Do I go out quietly
or do I go out fighting?

379
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,283
Fighting?

380
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,707
-[screams]
-Whoa! You scared me!

381
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,878
I've had enough of this!

382
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:53,092
-[Tatsuya] Hey! Stop! Stop!
-[Hansuke] Outta my way!

383
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,723
[screaming]

384
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,647
Back off! Back off, you scum!

385
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,483
Back off!

386
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,406
This is mine!

387
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,162
This belongs to me! It's mine!

388
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,416
[indistinct chatter]

389
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,504
-Hey!
-Let go!

390
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,967
[worker] What do you think you're doing?

391
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:22,067
What the heck have you done?

392
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,864
[screaming continues]

393
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,876
[Tatsuya] Quit filming!
You're trespassing!

394
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,880
[Mitsuyo] Stop it! Stop it!

395
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,178
[Kuniko] Roku-chan's missing!

396
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:38,391
[Tatsuya] One at a time, please!

397
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:40,186
Roku-chan's missing!

398
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:43,192
My husband got drunk
and set fire to Shima-san's place!

399
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,696
Hansuke!

400
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,702
-Hansuke!
-[Mitsuyo] This way!

401
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,962
[distant whooping]

402
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,383
[boisterous laughter]

403
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,097
-[Hansuke] Shima-san!
-[Masuo] At last, you came out.

404
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,309
At last, you came out.

405
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,815
It'll be fine.
They're tearing it down anyway.

406
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,694
-This'll make it easier.
-My sweet wife!

407
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,658
-Have a drink.
-My sweet wife's inside!

408
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,831
What? Why didn't you say so sooner?

409
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,210
No, Shima-san!

410
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,050
Oh no! What have I done?

411
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:19,014
-Hatsu, what have I done?
-Fire extinguisher!

412
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:20,559
Get a fire extinguisher!

413
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:22,312
You need the fire department.

414
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,986
The wind's pretty strong,
so it'll burn quickly.

415
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,656
Huh?

416
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:31,790
Hurry up and call the fire department.

417
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,670
[exclaims]

418
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:36,131
Roku-chan?

419
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:39,429
-[Hansuke] Shima-san!
-[screaming]

420
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:40,724
Hansuke!

421
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,106
-[Shima's wife] I've got no choice now.
-[Yoshie] Huh?

422
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,986
[shouting]

423
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:54,126
Oh my God!

424
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:58,175
Dodes'ka-den. Dodes'ka-den.

425
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,098
[uproarious shouting]

426
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:10,951
-Dodes…
-[distant shouting]

427
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,334
Watch out! Watch out!

428
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,715
Okay! Bring it on!

429
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:20,596
I don't know how.

430
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,896
I don't know how to stop it!

431
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,275
-Roku-chan!
-Roku-chan!

432
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,906
-Roku-chan!
-[uproarious shouting]

433
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,665
[shattering, crashing]

434
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:36,126
Mom!

435
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:39,842
-Mom…
-[explosion]

436
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,267
I'm sick of this!

437
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,321
Trains are better after all.

438
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,787
Hey!

439
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,458
-Mom! Mom!
-Roku-chan!

440
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,588
Mom! Mom!

441
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,218
-Are you hurt anywhere?
-No.

442
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:03,974
[resident 1] Hansuke! You okay?

443
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,898
[Tatsuya] Hansuke!

444
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:10,194
[resident 1] Is he dead?

445
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:12,282
[Tatsuya] He's alive! Hansuke!

446
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:14,369
[clamoring]

447
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,833
[crying]

448
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,047
[resident 2]
It's all burning down. Oh, dear!

449
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:30,694
-[sneezes]
-[all gasping]

450
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:46,601
[Katsuko starts laughing]

451
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,173
Awesome!

452
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,052
Awesome!

453
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:08,185
[cheering]

454
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:18,623
[Tatsuya] Awesome!

455
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,923
We did it!

456
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,770
[Hansuke] And that's how
we went out fighting.

457
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:39,790
SQUATTERS IN TEMPORARY HOUSING
BURN AND RIOT

458
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:43,756
The riot that day got replayed
again and again on tabloid TV shows.

459
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,470
It went viral for a week on social media.

460
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,182
[Tatsuya] You're trespassing!

461
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,352
[Hansuke] Who said you could film, dammit?

462
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:53,610
Long after that,

463
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:58,410
the former residents never spoke about
how they lived in that town.

464
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,790
Even if they crossed paths,

465
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,880
they would absolutely never
talk to each other.

466
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:07,220
It was an unwritten rule.

467
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,265
Don't interfere with

468
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:12,606
former friends hiding their past
and blending into society.

469
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:14,860
See how it looks in the mirror.

470
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:19,787
That's lovely. Are you looking for a top?

471
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,291
-[gleeful shouting]
-Dodes'ka-den. Dodes'ka-den.

472
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,462
Dodes'ka-den.

473
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:30,015
The event commemorating reconstruction
was ultimately never held.

474
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:36,821
The town without seasons no longer exists.

475
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:40,912
There is one thing that they did learn.

476
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,587
There is no worse way to live.

477
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:48,385
But there is also
no more human way to live.

478
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:51,851
I see.

479
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,525
Personally, I like it.

480
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:57,904
But it can't be published like this.

481
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:04,417
[editor] Mr. Tanaka?

482
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:07,758
Yeah, you're right.

483
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,555
The characters are captivating.

484
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,435
Like the homeless father and son
and train crazy Roku-chan.

A TOWN WITHOUT SEASONS

486
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:16,399
People like that don't exist.

487
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:19,656
But ethically,

488
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:23,080
"ganmodoki" and "sprouts" won't do.

489
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,796
Disrespecting women is a problem.
I liked those though.

00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:32,766
Next time, please write something
heartwarming where nobody gets hurt.

492
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,396
Thank you for coming all this way.

493
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:37,943
Thank you.

00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:40,406

495
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:53,599
PLAYING SHOGI WITHOUT PAWNS
IS PLAYING A LOSING GAME OF SHOGI

496
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:55,394
[laughs]

00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,955
THE END
