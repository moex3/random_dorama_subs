1
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:12,913
Mr. Rohan?

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,449
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,884
Mr. Rohan?

4
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,919
Mr. Rohan?

5
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,889
Come back!

6
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,037
How was it, Mr. Rohan?

7
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,940
Wonderful realism, isn't it?

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,279
This VR is so real, it's hard to believe
you're not actually underwater.

9
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:50,651
The manufacturer has absolute confidence
in its realism.

10
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,121
Not only has it attracted various media
outlets, we, as an advertisement agency

11
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,790
will launch a large-scale
advertisement campaign.

12
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,992
And this is where you come in.

13
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,896
Mr. Kishibe Rohan, you are very popular
among all generations.

14
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:08,268
Success is in our hands
if we have your endorsement.

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,537
That's why we visited you today.

16
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,174
Of course, we understand you're busy.

17
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,744
We have a few ideas of our own already.

18
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:18,879
For example--

19
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,282
Highly recommended by the Kishibe Rohan!

20
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,017
Rohan-approved!

21
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:28,088
Everyone from Pink Dark Boy shed tears!

22
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,656
They all cried!

23
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,827
We are very fortunate that
you showed interest in this product,

24
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,998
and that you were able to try it
for yourself.

25
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,669
We'd love to hear your honest opinion.

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,973
What did you think? No need to be polite.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,745
It's interesting.

28
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,781
The picture quality is much better
than it used to be.

29
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,919
I'm very interested in its possibilities
for entertainment purposes.

30
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,587
-Mr. Rohan, how perceptive!
-But--

31
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,656
-I expected no less!
-But…

32
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,994
I was able to breathe just fine,

33
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,063
and I didn't die.

34
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:15,602
Well, we don't want to cause any deaths.

35
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,140
Is it realistic when I can breathe
and don't drown underwater?

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,910
No, no.
This device isn't for inducing fear.

37
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:28,415
It's a lighthearted way
to experience the world.

38
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,719
You can easily write a manga
using this device as material.

39
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,190
You honestly think the Kishibe Rohan

40
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:43,397
would write manga
based on such arbitrary material?

41
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,232
What?

42
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,101
No matter how bizarre the story--

43
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,806
no, because it's bizarre--
it needs reality at its core,

44
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,442
or the readers will stop reading
right away.

45
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,544
That's why I always aim
for the real thing.

46
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,446
I seek out material seriously.

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,014
But…

48
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,017
death,

49
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,387
and the pain leading up to death--

50
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,491
This is one realism
I haven't been able to pursue.

51
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,996
I don't mind experiencing death.
But if I died, how could I write about it?

52
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,334
So I'll read about it instead.

53
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:26,406
I can experience the writer's reality
secondhand.

54
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,042
Fantastic.

55
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,612
Thank you for your comment.

56
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,481
Now, excuse us.

57
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:40,253
We'll cook up a comment
and apologize later.

58
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,489
Hold it.

59
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,130
Are you trying to deceive my readers?

60
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,134
That's not our intention.

61
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,302
Excuse us.

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,505
Heaven's Door.

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,342
Let the door to your mind now open.

64
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,978
What is this?

65
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,115
What in the…

66
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,628
This is a talent
that I have been gifted with.

67
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,133
I can change a person's memories and soul
into a book for me to read.

68
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:38,445
The human body remembers everything
that has ever happened to it.

69
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,783
Even if a person forgets,
the body does not.

70
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,021
These are 100% real memories
that can't be found in any interview.

71
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,089
I HEAR HE'S DIFFICULT

72
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,760
This reality is what breathes life
into my work,

73
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,830
providing only the finest entertainment.

74
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,499
WE'LL COOK UP
HIS COMMENTS LATER!

75
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,943
"Use Rohan's comments as they are."

76
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:16,917
The orders I write down
can never be disobeyed.

77
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:23,023
I can only see this as a gift from heaven,
but it's not as important

78
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:29,829
as my talent that uses them
as material for manga.

79
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,412
ROHAN

80
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,163
Yes, I've been cooped up for days.

81
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,235
I can't believe

82
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,404
we aren't allowed to cover stories
in person.

83
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,573
SIX MONTHS LATER
JULY 7, WEDNESDAY

84
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,244
What?

85
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,613
No way.

86
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,850
I can't feel out the interviewee
on an online meeting.

87
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,789
Don't drink, Bakin.
I'll get you new water.

88
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,592
There.

89
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,328
What?

90
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,932
No, not "Dokin," "Bakin."

91
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,402
Right. Little Bakin.

92
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:47,007
I never thought you were
the kind of person to get a dog.

93
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,242
Did my snacks arrive?

94
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,712
Yeah, though Bakin didn't like them.

95
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,913
Really?

96
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,983
He might be a puppy,
but he's a picky eater.

97
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,820
Oh, Mr. Rohan,
can we switch to video call?

98
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,255
Sure.

99
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,595
So, about the issue
I brought up the other day…

100
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,467
The new character for Pink Dark Boy:
Hot Summer Martha.

101
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,138
I thought hard about it again.

102
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,407
You say my design is plagiarism.

103
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,474
No.

104
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:27,147
They say there's an issue
with the three-circle design.

105
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,784
It may lead to copyright problems
down the road.

106
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:35,488
Getting complaints may be just
an urban legend,

107
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,823
but there is a possibility.

108
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,227
If it leads to problems,
you'd get lots of hate and slander online.

109
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,464
-Slander…
-So, I'm telling you,

110
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,167
we ought to change its design.

111
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,868
Izumi.

112
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,539
You've become a bit boring.

113
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,274
What?

114
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,976
When did you learn to tread so carefully?

115
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,879
Listen. If there's anyone on earth

116
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,683
who accuses me of plagiarizing designs,
tell them this:

117
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,819
Three circles is a design
that ancient Celts

118
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,988
would have doodled
on their bathhouse walls

119
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,023
without batting an eye,

120
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,559
monkey brain!

121
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,763
Mr. Rohan,
we're discussing a manga character here.

122
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,433
Two big, round ears aren't allowed.

123
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,436
Not to mention its black color.
They're practically identical!

124
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,540
Izumi,

125
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,612
those circles you called ears…

126
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,951
they're eyes.

127
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,320
What?

128
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,558
Mr. Rohan!

129
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,063
Mr. Rohan!

130
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,267
-I'm crazy about you!
-Thank you. How kind.

131
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,002
You're in my--

132
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,274
You're in my yard.
You can't just walk over.

133
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,710
-Mr. Rohan, I'm your biggest fan.
-That's very sweet.

134
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,246
My babies love you too.

135
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,516
Thanks, but I gave them my autograph
the other day, remember?

136
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,286
Anyway, please don't trespass
on my property.

137
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,756
I got scolded…

138
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,425
Will do.

139
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,771
Mr. Rohan, how did one of your fans
get a hold of your address?

140
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,840
I ran into her at the vet clinic.

141
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,242
Wow. You have to be on guard.

142
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll come over now and tell her off.

143
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,681
It's not that serious.

144
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,417
Nowadays, it can lead to serious trouble.

145
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,954
Let's change your locks
and install cameras.

146
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,255
I'll arrange it now.

147
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,623
I said it's fine!

148
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,696
Argh!

149
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,199
Mr. Rohan?

150
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,402
It's all because of this mask.

151
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,772
How much longer
do we have to keep this up?

152
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,008
Oxygen isn't getting to my brain.

153
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,611
Mr. Rohan, are you okay?

154
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,213
The recent events

155
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,783
have taught me that I'm the kind of man
who does his own research.

156
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,520
Visit the land,
touch the soil and feel the breeze,

157
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,157
join the crowd, and at times,
even lick rotten foods.

158
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,692
That's my manga.

159
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,696
Mr. Rohan, I understand.

160
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,731
Once the mandate lifts,

161
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,767
let's go anywhere, even overseas,
for material.

162
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,839
Mr. Rohan, where are you going?

163
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,741
Taking Bakin out on a walk.

164
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,288
He hasn't been himself lately.

165
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,358
I get he's under a lot of stress, but…

166
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,730
But I have to do something about this.

167
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,699
We're in trouble
if Pink Dark Boy gets canceled.

168
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,770
Oh, and order the locks.

169
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,474
BEWARE OF MUDSLIDE

170
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,814
Everything is stagnant.

171
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,122
The gears just don't mesh.
They don't turn well.

172
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,359
It's as if I'm walking through
a dark tunnel.

173
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,696
Am I despairing?

174
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,668
Maybe this is what
the others call depression.

175
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,805
It's as if I'm suffocating.

176
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,542
I can't go anywhere.

177
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,147
It's not that I'm refusing to move.

178
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,982
I'm just…

179
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,251
completely paralyzed.

180
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,124
What's wrong?

181
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,894
You become restless
whenever we come to this path.

182
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,296
Is something bothering you?

183
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,367
You're okay.

184
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,670
We'll steer clear of that path.
We'll go this way instead.

185
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,891
Is there something over that way?

186
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,306
How did we…

187
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,052
This shrine--

188
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,588
Has it always been here?

189
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,079
Incredible.

190
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,016
There was a different sacred tree
on the grounds,

191
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,019
but this one looks more dignified.

192
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,622
Is this one sacred also?

193
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,896
Strange.

194
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,467
It's cared for.

195
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,203
Rather,

196
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,238
it's sealed.

197
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,991
A mirror.

198
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,734
But why is it…

199
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,337
here?

200
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,211
Hey.

201
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,547
Do you feel it too, Bakin?

202
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,687
They're working for the first time
in a long time.

203
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,093
The wheels are finally turning.

204
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,131
What was that?

205
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,367
Are you okay, Bakin?

206
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,977
We'll set out
for a full-out research tomorrow.

207
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,321
Story materials are to be found outside.

208
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,257
That's for certain.

209
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,370
I HAVE NEWS!

210
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,274
Hot Summer Martha's first appearance
is tremendously popular.

211
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:27,146
I'll drop off your manuscript
around 3:00 p.m. today.

212
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,482
My manuscript?

213
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,987
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 7

214
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,132
Give me a break.

215
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,536
Look at this mess, Bakin.

216
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,573
Hold on.

217
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,612
I don't believe this.

218
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,247
Did you grow fangs already?

219
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,750
Of course not.

220
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,526
Don't cause too much trouble.

221
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,247
Mr. Rohan!

222
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,351
The latest volume of Pink Dark Boy
is selling like hotcakes!

223
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,655
The Hot Summer Martha arc
is a massive success.

224
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,424
Izumi, have you made any changes
to my manuscript?

225
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,394
I scanned it in.

226
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,029
That's not what I mean.

227
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,531
How did you get a hold of it--

228
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,801
No, who finished my manuscript?

229
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,137
Did you come in and grab my manuscript?

230
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,738
Also, this!

231
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,009
See that?

232
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,914
You had a designer do it, huh?

233
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,717
Well, yes.

234
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,787
I got a designer's help.

235
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,889
Is there a problem?

236
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,426
Yes, there's a problem!

237
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,429
This Hot Summer Martha design!

238
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,366
You changed the design to four circles!

239
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,870
You have no right to do this
just because of potential complaints!

240
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,307
Why are there four circles?

241
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,576
Wait a minute.

242
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,380
We discussed this design change.

243
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,585
I gave the manuscript back to you
after the printing process.

244
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,021
This happened…

245
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,891
about two weeks ago.

246
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,006
Are you okay, Mr. Rohan?

247
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,575
-Mr. Rohan?
-No!

248
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,244
I said no biting!

249
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,253
Hey, Mu-chan, stop.

250
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,456
What in the--

251
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,959
How did you get in?

252
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,494
Who are you?

253
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,562
Mr. Rohan.

254
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,665
What are you doing in my house?

255
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,368
Is that our next toy?

256
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,871
You're so dirty. Who will be the pitcher?

257
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:15,741
Mr. Rohan, you naughty man.

258
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,280
You're-- You were in my yard earlier.

259
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,816
What are you doing here?

260
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,684
-Pee time.
-What…

261
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,291
What on earth is going on?

262
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,093
This must be a dream.

263
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,608
"October"?

264
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,266
This manuscript…

265
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,369
I spilled ink on it today.

266
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:21,240
But the page has been completed.

267
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,311
The story, characters' lines, the layout…

268
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,748
Everything is my work,

269
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,418
save Hot Summer Martha's design.

270
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,686
I'm sure of it.

271
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,988
But…

272
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,358
I swear I didn't write this.

273
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,262
Then…

274
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,465
who did?

275
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,267
I borrowed your shirt.

276
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,602
Heaven's Door.

277
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,887
SEPTEMBER 23
I LOVE YOU, MR. ROHAN

278
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,789
SEPTEMBER 25

279
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,924
What in the world?

280
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:12,992
SEPTEMBER 29

281
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,428
Heaven's Door does not tell lies.

282
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,997
Meaning,

283
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,101
those days she spent with me are real.

284
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,569
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MR. ROHAN

285
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,241
This can't be true.

286
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,310
And…

287
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,518
These dates…

288
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:57,970
OCTOBER 7, THURSDAY

289
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,191
Thank you for stopping by.

290
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,061
But we're closed for the day.

291
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,563
We open at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

292
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm only passing through.

293
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,269
It's just more shrine grounds in the back.

294
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,705
This entire area belongs to the shrine.

295
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,910
I'm in a rush. Excuse me.

296
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,816
Is something the matter?

297
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,584
Is something the matter?

298
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,289
Is there something troubling you?

299
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,157
Is there something troubling you?

300
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,432
You are Kishibe Rohan, the manga artist.

301
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,236
Mr. Rohan, who lives nearby.

302
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,907
-Is something wrong?
-Is something wrong?

303
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,684
Tell me what you know

304
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,953
about the big tree behind the shrine.

305
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:22,988
I believe it's sacred.

306
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,623
-The divine tree?
-The divine tree?

307
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:25,958
Well, to be precise, no.

308
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,994
But there's a shrine at its base.
It's enshrined and in good condition.

309
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,296
What? You don't mean you took a peek?

310
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,298
Or that you went inside?

311
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,134
-Did you?
-Go inside?

312
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,842
I see.

313
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,212
So it was yours.

314
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,785
Was that August? No, July?

315
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,921
Yes, three months ago.

316
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,825
You came out of the back,
passed through the shrine grounds,

317
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,460
and walked off like a ghost.

318
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,529
I watched you walking off.

319
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:10,736
Looking back, that was Yabubako-Hoshi.

320
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,705
It must have been.

321
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,444
Hold on.

322
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,412
I don't understand a thing.

323
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,281
Mr. Rohan?

324
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,750
Are you in trouble?

325
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,219
Mr. Rohan, are you…

326
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,355
in big trouble?

327
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,291
Yes, I'm in trouble!

328
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,828
Three months flew by,
but I don't recall any of it!

329
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,895
No, no.

330
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,933
I would not say that time has flown.

331
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:45,904
It was all done by Yabubako-Hoshi,
who lives in the tree.

332
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,707
What are you saying?

333
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,076
-Shall we go, then?
-Do you wish to go?

334
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,990
This tree is 800 years old.

335
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,161
The shrine was built about 500 years ago.

336
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,331
Indeed, it's been about 500 years

337
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,934
since our ancestors enshrined this tree.

338
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,641
I believe you saw the mirror inside.

339
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,110
An old mirror on a pedestal.

340
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,312
I did.

341
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,516
The reflection you saw of yourself
was actually Yabubako-Hoshi.

342
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,653
It came out the moment

343
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,657
you were reflected in the mirror.

344
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,293
It took your place.

345
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,296
Took my place?

346
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,433
That's not right.

347
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:52,771
Yabubako-Hoshi took your place
and lived as you.

348
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,140
According to the legend,

349
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,344
Yabubako-Hoshi returns to the mirror
in three moon cycles.

350
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,447
Three cycles of the moon, or three months.

351
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,652
It was a blink of an eye for me.

352
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,756
Time is not constant.

353
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:15,661
There's no difference between
a split second and three months.

354
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:18,597
Just like the tale of Rip Van Winkle…

355
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,100
Who turned into an old man
at the end of the story.

356
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,071
But…

357
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,708
I can't accept this.

358
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,777
This makes no sense.

359
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,514
We may look the same, but he isn't me.

360
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,382
But he is you, Mr. Rohan.

361
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:42,754
Yabubako-Hoshi reflects
the yin to the yang.

362
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,058
He is your shadow.

363
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,393
Yin and yang.

364
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,129
They are the two sides of the same coin.

365
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,700
You did whatever you wanted
for the last three months.

366
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,902
That's what this means.

367
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,438
But in reality,

368
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,242
it messes up most people's lives,
just like yours.

369
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:07,145
This is why our ancestors blocked
the entrance and sealed the shrine.

370
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,384
I see.

371
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,124
I've stepped into a sacred territory

372
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:23,562
no one is allowed to enter.

373
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,771
I see what I've done.

374
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,806
I am…

375
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,809
truly sorry.

376
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,848
Now,

377
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,586
tell me how to undo this mess.

378
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,321
Undo this mess?

379
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,156
Undo this mess?

380
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,025
By "undo," do you mean

381
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,627
you want to go back in time,
from October to July?

382
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,264
You want to travel back in time?

383
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,732
That's right.

384
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,634
Yes, that's exactly it.

385
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,404
Yabubako-Hoshi is ruining my life!

386
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,605
Mr. Rohan.

387
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,976
The line between good and evil
is very blurry.

388
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,681
What is considered good, and what is evil?

389
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,751
It all depends on how you see it.

390
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,322
Yabubako-Hoshi is your shadow.

391
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,993
It may have relieved some of your stress.

392
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:33,498
What if you think of it as a dream
and embrace the yin and yang?

393
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,100
Good and evil.

394
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,008
Listen closely.

395
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,646
That was never my issue to begin with.

396
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,551
Four circles!

397
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:01,460
Something I didn't draw is circulating
under my name.

398
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,729
This is unforgivable.

399
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,765
That's the only thing I can't tolerate.

400
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:11,036
I couldn't care less about
the good and evil of society.

401
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,272
Is there a way to undo this or not?

402
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,675
Hurry up and tell me.

403
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:21,446
It's impossible to rewind the clock
back to July.

404
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,850
You cannot travel back in time to July.

405
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,090
I told you, didn't I?

406
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,060
Let's just cut this tree down.

407
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,097
Father, the head priest
ought not say such things.

408
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,036
What brought you here in the first place?

409
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,845
There's an intersection I usually walk by.

410
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,115
But on that day, I took a turn.

411
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:04,589
You need to proceed with caution.

412
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:10,328
Since ancient times,
it's dangerous when roads cross like this.

413
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:16,001
A little chance is all it takes
to run into those not of this world.

414
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,603
For example, a Tsujigami yokai.

415
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,908
It may be revered as a god, but Tsujigami
brings bad luck to intersections.

416
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,378
It has always been bad--

417
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,313
the four-way crossroad.

418
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,322
No use crying about it now.

419
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,793
From what you told us,
it's not so much about the time you lost,

420
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,695
it's about your manga, correct?

421
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,464
That's right.

422
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,466
Then we know of one way.

423
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,435
The enshrined mirror.

424
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,439
Rotate the mirror so that your reflection
does not cast upon it.

425
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,844
The mirror sits on a pedestal,
so I suggest you rotate the entire thing.

426
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,381
Rotate it 360 degrees to the left…

427
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,984
three times.

428
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:13,425
All of Yabubako-Hoshi's actions
will be undone.

429
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,628
Undone?

430
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,597
That means--

431
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,832
You won't get back the lost months.

432
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:27,806
Only the results of Yabubako-Hoshi's
actions will be severed from this world.

433
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,407
The actions will be sealed.

434
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,977
Yabubako-Hoshi's actions will disappear

435
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,446
if you rotate the mirror
counterclockwise three times.

436
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:37,849
But why…

437
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,552
three times?

438
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,521
We don't know.

439
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,290
But so it is conveyed.

440
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,128
Throughout the world, the number three

441
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,999
is considered a lucky
and harmonious number.

442
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,102
It's a balanced number,
known for stability.

443
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:01,006
Three is a good number.

444
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,347
Three.

445
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,586
Not four.

446
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,791
You mustn't forget.

447
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,128
Do not cast your reflection
onto the mirror.

448
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,031
Enter the shrine from behind.

449
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,537
Make three counterclockwise turns
with the mirror

450
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,440
and watch that Yabubako-Hoshi
does not see you.

451
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:43,048
This will undo everything it did.

452
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,333
-The caller is unable to answer…
-Strange.

453
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,703
Lately, Mr. Rohan hasn't been
answering my calls at all.

454
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,541
The Hot Summer Martha
figurine sample is ready.

455
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,176
I'll bring it to you now.

456
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,332
Is it…

457
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,601
finally over?

458
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,611
Good evening. It's me, Izumi.

459
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:51,983
Oh, right.

460
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,631
Mr. Rohan?

461
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,534
Your entrance is a complete mess!

462
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,706
Mr. Rohan?

463
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,574
Are you here?

464
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,936
Fantastic.

465
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,578
Still,

466
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,781
something feels a bit off.

467
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,226
Izumi installed this.

468
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,995
When did she get it done?

469
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,666
Bakin?

470
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,503
It's okay.

471
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,540
Bakin!

472
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,466
That mirror…

473
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,537
I rotated it three times

474
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,374
without casting my reflection!

475
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,643
But…

476
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,027
It's happening again.

477
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,535
FRIDAY, JANUARY 7

478
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:31,603
How?

479
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,672
Three months have passed!

480
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,643
Did I fail?

481
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:44,182
My image was reflected on something else,

482
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,552
which was then reflected onto the mirror.

483
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,263
JANUARY 7, FRIDAY

484
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,698
This can't be happening.

485
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,703
It's now a figurine!

486
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,774
Four circles…

487
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,663
Mr. Rohan.

488
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,798
Catch!

489
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,773
Is he Yabubako-Hoshi,
the one that took my place?

490
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,460
Izumi…

491
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,730
Are you all right?

492
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,133
Get a hold of yourself!

493
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,040
This is bad.

494
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,780
How…

495
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,016
You injected something…

496
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,685
No, someone else did this.

497
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,154
Who did this to you?

498
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,458
Was it…

499
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,160
me?

500
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,165
Mr. Rohan?

501
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,238
Tell me, Mr. Rohan.

502
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,875
This woman--

503
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,946
somehow she got a hold
of a spare key to the house.

504
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,182
How did she get it?

505
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,752
Hey.

506
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,187
How did she get it?

507
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,289
Stop!

508
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,060
This sly thief

509
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:15,800
sticks her neck
in other people's business.

510
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,504
She sat at your work desk
like she owned the place.

511
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,940
She put her fingerprints

512
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,377
all over the beautiful
Hot Summer Martha figurine

513
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,213
without disinfecting or wearing a mask!

514
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:33,618
Why?

515
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,987
Tell me, Mr. Rohan.

516
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:40,558
What gives her the right to do
whatever she wants in this room?

517
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,430
Izumi…

518
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,267
She has nothing to do with this.

519
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,870
We need…

520
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,774
to call the ambulance right this minute.

521
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,176
She's already…

522
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:02,647
Mr. Rohan, there's no way
I'm raising this baby by myself.

523
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,127
It can't be true!

524
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,595
Okay?

525
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,465
No…

526
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:25,002
I'm going to be with you for ten years,
20 years, 50 years,

527
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,673
and forever and ever.

528
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,049
Nope.

529
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,855
Three more minutes.

530
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:49,560
Or will it be five more minutes
before she dies?

531
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,097
We've got a few minutes to kill.

532
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,734
I know.

533
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,905
Your magical talent.

534
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,874
Wanna try it?

535
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:10,081
You know, I have an idea what it does.

536
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,718
I know you can read people's minds,
Mr. Rohan.

537
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,388
You do this motion…

538
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:20,992
with your hand.

539
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:25,429
I've had a near-death experience before.
I was in a car accident.

540
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,903
Hypnosis?

541
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,472
Mind reading?

542
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:38,776
Hey. Do you want to read my mind?

543
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:43,915
It's full of love and adulation for you.

544
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,584
I love you.

545
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,864
Never mind.

546
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:03,401
Not very fair only you get to read
other people's minds, is it?

547
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,669
I love you.

548
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,139
Please.

549
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,976
She only stopped by…

550
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,213
for… work.

551
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,218
Please.

552
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:21,953
Let her live.

553
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:26,390
Why should I?

554
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:30,127
Mr. Rohan,

555
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,530
I'm the only one you need.

556
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,433
That's why you loved me.

557
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,668
Isn't that right?

558
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,074
No.

559
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:46,544
We're going to sit here until she's dead.

560
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,047
You and I,

561
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,850
we'll be accomplices.

562
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,288
And we'll spend the rest of our lives

563
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:02,360
sharing our little secret together.

564
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,730
I love you.

565
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,599
Our baby,

566
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,736
you…

567
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,671
and me.

568
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,643
It'll just be our happy little family.

569
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:23,014
Okay?

570
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,521
Do you… see this?

571
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,290
This is…

572
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,060
my gift.

573
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,200
I call it Heaven's Door.

574
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:20,705
There's only…

575
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,507
truth…

576
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,543
written…

577
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,815
on here.

578
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,985
Aren't you curious?

579
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,828
Don't you want to confirm my love for you…

580
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,500
or the lack of it?

581
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,472
Know whether I've betrayed you…

582
00:47:56,507 --> 00:48:00,244
or… trust you?

583
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,013
You just might

584
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,217
learn…

585
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,821
the truth for yourself.

586
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:52,096
But promise me…

587
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,299
that once you're done…

588
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,503
you obey my orders.

589
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:29,166
Turn Yabubako-Hoshi's mirror
counterclockwise three times.

590
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,772
This will undo…

591
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,476
all of Yabubako-Hoshi's actions.

592
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:52,823
I don't know
what kind of a shadow she released.

593
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,792
Even so,

594
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,062
it was my responsibility to see

595
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:03,534
that she didn't cause any trouble.

596
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:07,872
DON'T COMMIT ANY CRIMES - I WILL
KILL ANYONE WHO GETS IN MY WAY

597
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,180
Though he was…

598
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,149
just a shadow,

599
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,686
that Yabubako-Hoshi…

600
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,959
He is my dark side.

601
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,239
Why am I sleeping here?

602
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,812
Sorry, Mr. Rohan. Looks like I dozed off.

603
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,652
Oh, no. I have submissions today.

604
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:59,089
Mr. Rohan, I'm leaving your sample here.
Don't forget to check it out.

605
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,157
I'll be off.

606
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,065
Bakin!

607
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,868
Let's go to the dog park
with my Maron sometime.

608
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,904
See you.

609
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,233
Four circles…

610
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,338
It didn't change.

611
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,945
Hot Summer Martha's design…

612
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,850
had nothing to do with Yabubako-Hoshi?

613
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,454
This means…

614
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,197
Izumi Kyoka…

615
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,835
That woman…

616
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,340
Hurry up and show me!

617
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,010
-Hurry up!
-Yeah, hurry it up!

618
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,679
What a sick enemy!

619
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,381
Hot Summer Martha!

620
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,783
There's no way it can be defeated.

621
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,185
There!

622
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:38,856
It's awesome!

623
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,126
Let me read the next page!

624
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,962
-Hurry up!
-Turn the page!

625
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:48,399
Hurry!
