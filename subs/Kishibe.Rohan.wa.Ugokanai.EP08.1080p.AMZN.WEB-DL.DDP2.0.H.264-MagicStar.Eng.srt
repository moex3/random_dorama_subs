1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,409
The new character for Pink Dark Boy:
Hot Summer Martha.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,147
They say there's an issue
with the three-circle design.

3
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,150
This Hot Summer Martha design!

4
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,988
You changed the design to four circles!

5
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,324
Why are there four circles?

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:29,363
It was all done by Yabubako-Hoshi,
who lives in the tree.

7
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:35,135
It came out the moment
you were reflected in the mirror.

8
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,071
It took your place.

9
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,809
Yabubako-Hoshi took your place
and lived as you.

10
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,413
Make three counterclockwise turns
with the mirror.

11
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:51,351
This will undo everything it did.

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,922
Four circles?

13
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,892
It didn't change.

14
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,296
Hot Summer Martha's design

15
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,867
had nothing to do with Yabubako-Hoshi?

16
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,870
Izumi Kyoka…

17
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,474
that woman…

18
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:37,564
Are you… Mr. Kishibe Rohan's editor?

19
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,667
Yes?

20
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,171
At the café…

21
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:53,347
You always have the Pink Dark Boy meetings
at the café down the hill, right?

22
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,618
Thanks for reading it.

23
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,522
Sorry. I can't get his autograph now.
I'm on my way to work.

24
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:10,597
Why does Hot Summer Martha have
four circles instead of three?

25
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,238
Because it looks stronger, I guess.

26
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,706
Bye.

27
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,217
You're still here?

28
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,754
I've already submitted
this week's manuscript,

29
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,557
and the meeting for the one-shot
is tomorrow.

30
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,630
Mr. Rohan, are you still mad

31
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,466
about Hot Summer Martha?

32
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,775
You told me it was okay
to leave it up to the designer.

33
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:02,843
No.

34
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,415
It's not your fault, Izumi.

35
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:16,389
I thought it was weird when you said okay
after being so against it.

36
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,060
Back then, you were acting differently,

37
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,829
and we couldn't meet due to remote work.

38
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,232
Thinking about it now,

39
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,936
I should've talked to you in person
about it.

40
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,276
Why don't you create a new character
with three circles?

41
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,014
Hot Summer Martha's brother,
Hot Summer Brother!

42
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,584
As long as the color isn't black,
the team might approve it.

43
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,719
Izumi.

44
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,356
Oh, yeah. Earlier…

45
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,576
I want to speak with Kishibe Rohan.

46
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,045
Sorry, but this is where I work.

47
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,713
I don't like surprise visits.

48
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:18,118
Why doesn't Hot Summer Martha
have three circles?

49
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,389
You're that kid!

50
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,693
PINK DARK BOY 95

51
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,662
Aren't these eyes?

52
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,133
Considering Hot Summer Martha's
abilities and body,

53
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,137
I can't find a reason for having
another eye here.

54
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,975
In other words, it's not necessary.

55
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,646
And there's no beauty
in having four circles.

56
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,849
Look at it. Doesn't it look messy?

57
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,721
Having three makes it
simple and beautiful.

58
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,825
Hot Summer Martha would've been perfect
with three circles.

59
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,531
Make it three.

60
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,933
It's still not too late.

61
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,936
Everything works if it was three.

62
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,373
It should be three. Three.

63
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,117
Thanks for your thoughts.
I'll take it into consideration.

64
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,795
Mr. Rohan,
you should install a security camera.

65
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,466
Huh? Wasn't there one before?

66
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,701
He must have followed you.

67
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,138
But what a strange kid.

68
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,642
So opinionated and logical.

69
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,280
What he said was… right.

70
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,117
I guess.

71
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,619
He has to be a huge fan of mine.

72
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,255
He's read Pink Dark Boy multiple times.

73
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,959
If he didn't perfectly understand
my preferences and style,

74
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,762
he couldn't have analyzed it like that.

75
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,565
But is three such a perfect number?

76
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,939
Which one is more stable?

77
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,007
Huh?

78
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,981
Well, out of the two, the triangle.

79
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,283
The center of gravity looks more stable.

80
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,517
Exactly.

81
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:09,089
Three is the simplest and most stable.

82
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,590
It's a special number

83
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,494
that has symbolized harmony and strength
since ancient times.

84
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,231
Amaterasu bestowed
the Three Sacred Treasures.

85
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,433
Christianity has the Trinity.

86
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,837
There's also "The third time's the charm."

87
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:30,343
Anyway,
he understands my original intentions.

88
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,315
Mr. Rohan, why don't you reconsider having
a Hot Summer Martha with three circles?

89
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:39,953
You think it's that easy to change
what I've already approved and published?

90
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,055
That's why you should make it her brother.

91
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,493
What about a sister?

92
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,097
With cute colors like pink and yellow.

93
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,234
Enough!

94
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,103
-Put it down.
-Yes.

95
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,773
-Open it.
-Yes.

96
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,185
What's in here?

97
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,121
-Isn't it cute?
-Go do your job.

98
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,558
Geez!

99
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,831
But it looks like he's back to himself.

100
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,903
The meeting for the one-shot is tomorrow!

101
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,335
Three is perfect.

102
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,671
Three is perfection.

103
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,406
Kishibe Rohan.

104
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,374
I won't forgive you.

105
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,110
Ever.

106
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,611
DANGER

107
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,012
It should be three.

108
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,916
Three, three, three--

109
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,022
Three.

110
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,459
Rock.

111
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,428
Scissors.

112
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,533
Paper.

113
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,472
It's perfect.

114
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,670
Mr. Rohan, let's play rock paper scissors.

115
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,908
Rock, paper, scissors.

116
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,680
The three moves makes it the perfect duel.

117
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,015
Rock, paper…

118
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,436
Hold wrists at a perfect 90-degree angle.

119
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,773
Keep all fingers straight and unbent.

120
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,950
Place palms forward.

121
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,153
While maintaining wrist placement,

122
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,056
bend each finger, one at a time.

123
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,892
One, two,

124
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:45,198
three, four, five.

125
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,004
And now open them again, one at a time.

126
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,669
Look at the time already.

127
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,113
Hey, taxi!

128
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,849
Hey, you!

129
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,951
Why are you cutting in?

130
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,787
What? Are you half asleep?

131
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,324
I'm the one who got the taxi.

132
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,859
What did you say?

133
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,327
Got a problem with that?

134
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,629
Then…

135
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,766
let's decide who'll take this taxi…

136
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,675
with rock paper scissors.

137
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,176
Rock paper scissors!

138
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,122
You lose if you're too slow.

139
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,460
Ready? Rock, paper--

140
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,628
Heaven's Door.

141
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,299
Sorry. Can you wait about 30 seconds?

142
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:12,178
There's something strange about this kid.

143
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,222
"Oyanagi Ken.
Eleven years old. Sixth grade.

144
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,558
Likes math and writing.

145
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:31,097
Enjoys pointing out his teacher's math
and spelling mistakes.

146
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,400
Favorite manga: Pink Dark Boy.

147
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,768
Has all the volumes.

148
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,605
Considers volumes 28 and 40
as masterpieces.

149
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,307
Has read them at least 20 times.

150
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,710
Dislikes bell peppers and red bean buns.

151
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,447
Favorite food: fatty meat.

152
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,250
Has never pooped at school."

153
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,623
Well, he's a little pushy,
but naive like a kid.

154
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,392
Was it my imagination?

155
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,960
I don't see any problems.

156
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,173
"Likes rock paper scissors.

157
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,476
Has strong urges to play
rock paper scissors.

158
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,812
Starts the game with scissors."

159
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,949
This kid

160
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,819
really just wants to play
rock paper scissors.

161
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,627
Let's start.
You lose instantly if you're too slow.

162
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,296
If we tie, we play until someone wins.

163
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,165
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, let's do it.

164
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,900
I just need to play, right?

165
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,870
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

166
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,605
Satisfied? See ya.

167
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,614
I lost.

168
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,469
Huh?

169
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,740
What are you doing? That's my seat.

170
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,743
What? Your seat?

171
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,812
You haven't sat down yet.

172
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,282
Besides, have you ordered?

173
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,285
No, you haven't.

174
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,222
Which means this isn't your seat.

175
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,091
-It's mine.
-What's with you?

176
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,095
You've been getting in my way.
Didn't I say I'd consider your opinions?

177
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,098
Let's decide whose seat this is
with rock paper scissors.

178
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,433
Rock paper scissors.

179
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,536
Welcome. Excuse me.

180
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,072
-Orange juice.
-All right.

181
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,609
Sir, we don't have any tables available.

182
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,077
Wait a minute.

183
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,447
I'm the one who got his seat taken.
He's the one in the wrong.

184
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,482
No!

185
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,186
-I sat here first!
-This kid!

186
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,790
-This is my seat!
-Can't you just give him your seat?

187
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,726
He's just a child.
Aren't you acting childish?

188
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,794
Shut up!

189
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,663
You've got me mad now.

190
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,800
Fine. I'll play rock paper scissors.

191
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,369
I just have to play, right?
Rock paper scissors!

192
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,506
That's more like it.

193
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,277
You lose if you're too slow.
If we tie, we play till there's a winner.

194
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,579
-I know. Stop repeating it.
-Here we go!

195
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,381
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

196
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,285
Yes! I won, I won! Take that!

197
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,256
This is the first time I'm this happy
to win rock paper scissors.

198
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,726
Now get out of the way, kid.

199
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,297
Mr. Rohan…

200
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,666
You think I'm acting childish?

201
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,036
Everyone?

202
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,238
Nope!

203
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,208
It's the best feeling to beat a kid.

204
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,580
Cancel the orange juice. Make it iced tea.
Izumi, let's start the meeting.

205
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,249
I found my inspiration just now.

206
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,251
What?

207
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:13,919
Leave.

208
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,122
Leave.

209
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,691
Leave!

210
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,071
Mr. Rohan, you're really tough on kids.

211
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,141
He's only in elementary school!

212
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,011
You never know how and when
rumors will spread in this age.

213
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,282
You'll be in trouble if
"popular manga artist makes children cry"

214
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,950
spreads all over the Internet.

215
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,088
I don't believe kids are pure
and innocent.

216
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,157
They are the embodiment of evil

217
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,959
and think they'll be forgiven
just because they're kids.

218
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,463
That part of you is really stubborn.

219
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,366
Isn't that kid a fan of yours?

220
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,468
Well, he is a weird kid.

221
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,769
You…

222
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,239
Our meeting is done.
Why don't you go home?

223
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,241
You've got other manga artists to see.

224
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,277
-But--
-Rock, paper, scissors.

225
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,513
You played paper. It's my win. Bye.

226
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,184
Geez.

227
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,043
BOTANICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA

228
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,792
These plant illustrations can be used
as reference material.

229
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,431
This bookstore isn't bad.

230
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,503
7,500 yen.

231
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,239
Did I bring enough?

232
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,911
Excuse me. I'd like to buy this book!

233
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,447
Stop. You!

234
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,152
Should we decide with rock paper scissors?

235
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:29,355
Fine.

236
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,824
You lose if you're slow.

237
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,728
If it's a tie, we keep playing, right?

238
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,268
Here I go.

239
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,271
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock!

240
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,542
Quit messing around.

241
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,611
Don't come near me again!

242
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,118
I won.

243
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,021
Look! It's paper.

244
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,156
I won.

245
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,891
I finally won!

246
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,428
This makes one win, two losses.

247
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,333
What's with this kid?

248
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,241
What's going on?

249
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,843
This is…

250
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,456
Does he…

251
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,693
have the same kind of gift I do?

252
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,466
But why?

253
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,235
This is amazing!

254
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,806
I feel a beautiful and amazing power
pouring into me.

255
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,608
This is bad.

256
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,477
I'm getting more and more powerful!

257
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,046
Heaven's Door.

258
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,988
Why…

259
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,924
does this kid have such power?

260
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,949
"I can't attack Kishibe Rohan."

261
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,401
"I got Pink Dark Boy volume 95

262
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,403
after waiting in line since morning.

263
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:58,470
So lucky.

264
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,574
So excited for the first appearance of
the strongest enemy, Hot Summer Martha.

265
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,043
It finally appears!"

266
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,145
What's this?

267
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,913
"Something's wrong.

268
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,318
Did Kishibe Rohan really draw
this character?

269
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,953
I can't believe this.

270
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:21,393
Four circles isn't beautiful at all.

271
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,863
It would've been perfect if it was three.

272
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,777
It took all my courage
to ask him directly,

273
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,513
but he just turned me away.

274
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,617
I had so much respect for him,
but this is the end for Kishibe Rohan.

275
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:46,952
What a disappointment.

276
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:52,024
Kishibe Rohan has no right
to draw Pink Dark Boy."

277
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,376
"Three.

278
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,412
The perfect number. Three.

279
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,749
Rock. Scissors. Paper.

280
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,854
I want to play rock paper scissors
with Kishibe Rohan.

281
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,489
I really want to.

282
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,925
I'll beat Rohan with rock scissors paper

283
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,429
and make him unable to draw manga."

284
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,450
I'll never forgive you for drawing
such a character.

285
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,755
You should never draw manga again.

286
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:00,759
That's why I'm going to win.

287
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,063
I'll beat you with rock scissors paper.

288
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,932
Rock scissors paper…

289
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,305
Rock paper scissors
isn't a game of chance.

290
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,276
It's about your will to win.

291
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,547
Winning rock paper scissors is

292
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,284
winning with the power of your heart!

293
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,922
If I defeat you at rock paper scissors,

294
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:35,127
it means my spirit is stronger than yours.

295
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,364
What… are you talking about?

296
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,672
I will overcome you.

297
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,747
I CAN'T ATTACK KISHIBE ROHAN

298
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,082
I CAN ATTACK KISHIBE ROHAN

299
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,189
He changed Heaven's Door.

300
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,395
First to win three duels wins.

301
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,732
So if I win two more times,

302
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,603
all your powers will be mine.

303
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,706
Then…

304
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,943
you will never draw manga.

305
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,847
This…

306
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,650
little brat!

307
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,333
A third of your power is now mine.

308
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,770
That won't work on me anymore.

309
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,995
What exactly is…

310
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,504
An X.

311
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,240
"Ten" in Chinese writing.

312
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,315
Don't tell me that's…

313
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,751
You need to proceed with caution.

314
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:45,524
Since ancient times,
it's dangerous when roads cross like this.

315
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,693
It has always been bad--

316
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,896
the four-way crossroad.

317
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,833
Tsujigami.

318
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,236
Mr. Rohan.

319
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,976
Looks like if I don't play
rock paper scissors,

320
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:43,081
you'll do whatever you want with me.

321
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,451
You finally understand.

322
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,258
Fine.

323
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,930
I'll play rock scissors paper.

324
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,133
Good!

325
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,536
Good?

326
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,306
What are you laughing at?

327
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,242
I just…

328
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:15,080
wonder if you understand your situation.

329
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,318
You're the one with one win, two losses.

330
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:22,921
You can't afford to lose again.

331
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,692
Do you understand
you're standing on the edge?

332
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:31,596
If you lose the next match,

333
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,367
it's over for you.

334
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,771
Of course I know that.

335
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,644
But I will still overcome you.

336
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,283
All right. Do your best.

337
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,051
But I'll say it again:

338
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,388
I have the luxury of two more chances.

339
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:59,891
The one standing on the cliff is you.

340
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,896
Are you putting pressure on me?

341
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,065
Maybe.

342
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,404
Now, shall we play?

343
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,072
No, not yet.

344
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,746
Actually, I'm thinking about
what move to make.

345
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,617
Didn't I just win with paper?

346
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,788
It's human nature
to want to use something else,

347
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,726
but maybe that's a childish strategy.

348
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:40,565
But it doesn't look like
you have a naive personality,

349
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,970
so I was thinking it's also a good idea

350
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,539
to be sly and play paper twice in a row.

351
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,795
Okay, I've decided.

352
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,665
Let's go!

353
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,801
Rock, scissors, paper, shoot!

354
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:16,868
What?

355
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,237
I did it! I won with paper!

356
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,340
I beat your spirit once again!

357
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,810
With this, it's now two wins, two losses!

358
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:38,056
Looks like you can't stand up.

359
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,994
Should we take a break?

360
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,704
No.

361
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,373
There's no need.

362
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,210
When I win…

363
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,548
I should be looking…

364
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,421
down at you like this as you lose.

365
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,659
That's good.

366
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,898
We're now even,
with two wins and two losses.

367
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,669
That means you and I are both
standing on the edge.

368
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,139
But, you know, Mr. Rohan,

369
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,945
it doesn't feel like I'll lose at all.

370
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,818
You see, think about it.

371
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,690
Even if we both have two wins and losses,

372
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:50,161
I've won twice in a row after two losses.

373
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,899
It's the opposite for you.

374
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,003
You've lost twice in a row.

375
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,376
You are now…

376
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,113
in a slump in this duel.

377
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,015
Mr. Rohan.

378
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,019
I'll say it again.

379
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,022
You're now…

380
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,025
in a slump!

381
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,869
You've gotten better…

382
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,140
at pressuring your opponent.

383
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,343
No.

384
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,446
It's the truth.

385
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:48,119
It's true that you've lost twice in a row.

386
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,658
That's just the truth.

387
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,963
But if you're saying that,

388
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,335
I'll tell you another truth.

389
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,110
In the next round…

390
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,550
you won't be able to…

391
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,189
use paper.

392
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,059
Well, I wonder.

393
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,330
Come on.

394
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,567
Hey, now. Wait a minute.

395
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:39,604
You just said I was in a slump.

396
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,909
I've used rock twice and lost.

397
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,446
Rock is now an unlucky move to me.

398
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,648
Am I wrong?

399
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,487
Do you think I'll use the unlucky rock

400
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:01,826
in this important, last round?

401
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,931
Use the unlucky rock three times in a row?

402
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:15,774
Since you said I was in a slump,

403
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,076
you can't use paper.

404
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,878
Because if you did,

405
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,948
then you'll be admitting
that I'm not in a slump.

406
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:28,853
I'll stick with it.

407
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,190
No, you won't.

408
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,145
Let's go, Kishibe Rohan.

409
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,713
Rock paper scissors…

410
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,651
shoot!

411
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,152
What?

412
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,090
It's a tie.

413
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,860
After all that I said,

414
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:13,264
he still has the guts to use paper!

415
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,867
What strong spirit!

416
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,270
I won't lose.

417
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,240
I'm on a winning streak.

418
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,678
Not good. I can't predict what he'll do.

419
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,247
I'll use paper again.

420
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,751
Four in a row! I'll stick with paper!

421
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,488
Argh! Use my instincts. Rock!

422
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,624
I'll make the unlucky rock lucky.

423
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,760
Paper!

424
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,094
There's only rock!

425
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,032
Let's go! Shoot!

426
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,877
My knee's losing strength.

427
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,714
What? He's moving differently.

428
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,585
He's going to use scissors!
I can't go with paper!

429
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,466
Looks like

430
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:28,106
this is no longer my unlucky rock.

431
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,245
The one losing his luck…

432
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,850
Kid!

433
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,689
Don't you think…

434
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,058
it's you?

435
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,204
Hey, Miss!

436
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,655
Hey, Mr. Rohan. Let's test our luck.

437
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:24,829
Since she knows you,
she should come if we call her.

438
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,499
But if luck is still on my side,

439
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,936
she won't come over.

440
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,305
What?

441
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,342
Hey, Miss!

442
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:40,545
Come play rock paper scissors
with me and Mr. Rohan!

443
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,847
Why are you--

444
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,516
You should call her over too.

445
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,187
Those two are still together!

446
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,856
Come quickly!
Let's play rock paper scissors!

447
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,361
Rock paper scissors?
Are they still fighting?

448
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,164
Mr. Rohan is really so childish.

449
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:10,875
But I can't be doing this.
I have to pick up Mr. Jugo's manuscript.

450
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:12,844
Sorry!

451
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,581
Be nice to him, Mr. Rohan!

452
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,517
And you should go home soon!

453
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,023
Yes!

454
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,525
Looks like my luck is still better.

455
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,530
I'd be invincible

456
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,334
even at Russian roulette
with five bullets in six chambers.

457
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,531
Look! Even if I do this!

458
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,925
Now, let's have our final round.

459
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,077
What are you doing?

460
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,979
Let's get started already.

461
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,582
I've already started.

462
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,751
Just like this.

463
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,620
I'll be using this.

464
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,959
-What do you mean?
-It's exactly what you see.

465
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,494
I've already decided.

466
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:11,662
This is what I'll use.

467
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,564
It's you who needs to start.

468
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,835
Stop joking.

469
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,637
This isn't a joke.

470
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:26,044
You've got luck that will help you win.

471
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:32,050
Hurry up and choose your winning move,
so we can duel.

472
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:38,055
You'll change to rock at the last second.

473
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,527
All your plans are useless.

474
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,397
I'll tell you one thing.

475
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,569
You said you'll overcome me,

476
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,473
but I've lived longer,
so I'll give you some advice:

477
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:02,547
Beating someone isn't hard.

478
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,682
It's harder to--

479
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,817
You ready?

480
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,653
It's harder to…

481
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,759
overcome yourself.

482
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,864
I will overcome my own luck.

483
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,869
No matter what you say,

484
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,206
I will not be losing.

485
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,047
Let's go! Let's play!

486
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,082
Rock, scissors, paper…

487
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,122
shoot!

488
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,429
But I should've played scissors.

489
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,101
With this, I have three wins, two losses.

490
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,606
Your rock is the unlucky rock.

491
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,542
Why?

492
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:16,287
You hate this Hot Summer Martha.

493
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,658
You have a strong hatred
for the four-circle design.

494
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,093
When you see it,

495
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:26,564
you always turn red,
clenching your right fist.

496
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,171
In other words, when you get angry…

497
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,777
you unconsciously make a fist.

498
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:46,284
Don't look down on a manga artist's
power of observation.

499
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:52,490
You relied only on your luck.

500
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,394
I changed my luck with my own strength.

501
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:01,699
That's what it means to overcome yourself.

502
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:09,774
Shut up!

503
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,710
That was a battle of words!

504
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,246
You won by cheating!

505
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:16,714
You coward!

506
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:19,517
Let's play another round!

507
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:30,962
Sure.

508
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,033
I'll play.

509
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,170
All right!

510
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,038
I'll overcome you!

511
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,940
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

512
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,943
Shoot! Shoot!

513
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,046
I can't win.

514
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,392
Not yet.

515
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,661
Not yet!

516
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,664
I haven't lost yet!

517
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,501
My spirit will not lose to you!

518
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,639
I'll win.

519
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,108
I'll definitely win!

520
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,678
I won't lose!

521
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,991
Rock, paper…

522
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,928
Wow! I like you, kid!

523
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:42,500
I have a weakness for drama
and courage like yours.

524
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,359
I lost.

525
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,431
I've been utterly defeated.

526
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,038
SHISHI JUGO

527
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,339
Mr. Jugo!

528
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,310
Mr. Jugo!

529
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,081
He's not in! Again!

530
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:08,219
And he tells me to come on time!

531
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,155
He's too carefree!

532
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:14,291
Aren't you a smart boy?

533
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:19,597
Lately, you only visit
when it's time to walk Bakin.

534
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,967
That's not true. It's just a coincidence.

535
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,401
Right, little Bakin?

536
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:26,737
Oh, sure. I believe you.

537
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:32,042
Oh, Mr. Rohan, was everything okay
with the rock-paper-scissors boy?

538
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,878
He seemed very stubborn.

539
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,180
Yes. No problem.

540
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,282
That's good.

541
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,352
Did you give him something? An autograph?

542
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:43,988
Kind of.

543
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,756
Good boy!

544
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,293
That was really…

545
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,897
due to the Tsujigami?

546
00:48:55,232 --> 00:49:00,070
A demon that lives in a four-way
intersection and plays tricks on humans.

547
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:04,241
It should have been sealed,

548
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:10,948
but if something caused it to appear

549
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,686
and resonated with the strong emotions
of a human

550
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,825
and played a prank
that amplified those emotions…

551
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,333
Have you heard of
tsuji-ura street fortune-telling?

552
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,168
Tsuji-ura fortune?

553
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,404
Not backstreet?

554
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,041
Tsuji-ura is an ancient Japanese form
of fortune-telling.

555
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:41,645
A four-way intersection is also
an intersection with the spirit world.

556
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:45,049
So conversations from people walking by
have a strange power.

557
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,952
For example, when you want to know
your love fortune

558
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:51,989
and you hear "My shoelaces are undone,"
your love life isn't good.

559
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,459
If you hear "There's gum on my shoe,"
your love life will be good.

560
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,194
Wow.

561
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:02,433
But it sounds like a stretch.
It relies too much on coincidences.

562
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:05,169
Most fortune-telling is
deciphering coincidences.

563
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,505
It's bad luck
if a black cat crosses your path

564
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,140
and good if the tea stalk is
floating upright.

565
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:11,709
That is true.

566
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,379
But where is that special intersection?

567
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,481
It doesn't have to a particular one.

568
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,385
Then let's tell our fortunes here!

569
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:27,391
I want to travel overseas.

570
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,060
Impossible! That's impossible!

571
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,598
Why? You promised!
Going to a haunted house!

572
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,833
Never!

573
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,001
Why not?

574
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,637
Didn't you say it wasn't scary?

575
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:44,742
Let's go.

576
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:51,348
Even so, Japanese people
came up with a lot of things.

577
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,550
It's not just Japan.

578
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:56,620
Strange and mysterious things are found
all over the world.

579
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,424
The stories of the curse of King Tut
and the ghosts of London Tower

580
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,393
are still talked about today.

581
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,495
There's an association of vampires
in Italy

582
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:07,831
with 2,000 registered vampires.

583
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:13,103
There could be something hiding
behind the things we take for granted.

584
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,241
There are stories all over the world.

585
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:20,244
All over? Sounds good.

586
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,413
Let's go abroad for the next one.

587
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,950
It's been so long since I visited Taiwan
or Hong Kong.

588
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,484
Bangkok is good too.

589
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,253
Kuala Lumpur is also--

590
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:32,389
Mr. Rohan!

591
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,492
The new chapters will be
about intersections.

592
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,529
I want to start on it right away,
so please leave.

593
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,197
Geez!

594
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,905
It's good he's feeling better now.

595
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:02,219
Hold wrists at a perfect 90-degree angle.

596
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,522
Keep all fingers straight and unbent.

597
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,732
Place palms forward.

598
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:19,870
While maintaining wrist placement,
bend each finger, one at a time.

599
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,308
One, two, three, four, five.

600
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,779
And now open them again, one at a time.

601
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:32,649
One, two, three, four…

602
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,736
Stories are found all over the world.

603
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:32,576
Paris!

604
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,521
The Louvre Museum.
