1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,400
FISHING PROHIBITED AREA

2
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:12,667
What a bust.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,433
That was some tight security.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,934
I knew it.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,433
Reaching the other side of Hyogara Rocks

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,467
is nearly impossible.

7
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,567
There were more security cameras
than I could count.

8
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:33,433
I would've loved to get my hands on
just one abalone.

9
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,567
Though it won't be that hard
to scam that foreigner.

10
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:38,800
I agree.

11
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:42,467
He easily believed me when I said we have
hookups in the fishing union.

12
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:46,200
It looked like he would hand over
a million yen for one abalone.

13
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,900
All that money for abalone?
Must be a real dimwit.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I know.

15
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,600
Let's find some other ones
at another spot close by.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,266
That man doesn't know a thing
about this area.

17
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:02,600
If we pull a poker face and say
it came from Hyogara Rocks,

18
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,000
he won't be any wiser.

19
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,166
That's smart!

20
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,600
Boss, I swear you're a genius!

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,767
Oh stop it, I'm no genius--

22
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,533
You there! Pipe down, will you?

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought I'd finally get to see them.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,433
Now they're hiding.

25
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,367
Just unbelievable.

26
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,033
-Excuse me?
-What?

27
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:37,166
Is that Kishibe Rohan?

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,066
What do you mean?

29
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,166
I was hard at work.

30
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,266
I came to do a live drawing
of the rare Japanese mitten crabs

31
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,734
said to inhabit this area.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
These creatures are delicate

33
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:55,734
and only come out for a short span of time
in the early hours of the day.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,166
I quietly camped all night to see them.

35
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,567
They were finally beginning to emerge…

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,633
-when you came along.
-Right.

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,767
Live drawing? Well, pardon our intrusion.

38
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,266
Here's an idea though.

39
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:16,333
What if instead of going through
all that trouble, you Google them?

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,734
Boss, he's the famous manga artist,
Kishibe Rohan.

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,133
-He's a well-known celebrity!
-Wait, manga?

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,367
Manga, though?

43
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,567
Then what's the issue here?

44
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:30,867
More reason for a quick Google search.

45
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,133
What are they called again?
I'll pull it up on my phone.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,100
-It's for manga--
-You honestly think the Kishibe Rohan…

47
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:44,433
would be satisfied referencing
some stock photo on the Internet?

48
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,000
Come again?

49
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,300
My vocation is creating manga art.

50
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,667
Reality is the most important thing
in a work of manga.

51
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,333
That's why I dedicate myself
to finding authentic material

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,467
in the name of pursuing realism.

53
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:02,333
That goes for a critter
that appears on a single panel too.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,333
Its color, shape, scent, and…

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
taste.

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,600
The entire manga would be a lie

57
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:23,100
if I don't express the realism
I experience with my own body and senses.

58
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:29,333
A manga approached
with half-baked research…

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,667
is nothing but an offense to the readers.

60
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,734
Well, we'll get going.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Hold it.

62
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:44,767
You two.

63
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:47,467
You're interesting.

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,533
Let me use you two as my reference.

65
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,133
Perhaps one day,
you'll make good material for manga.

66
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm interested
in what you were about to do.

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Weren't you…

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,166
going to poach?

69
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,200
I don't have the faintest idea
of what you mean.

70
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,667
Ridiculous.

71
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,734
-Our cover's blown.
-Time to go.

72
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:17,934
Heaven's Door.

73
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,200
Let the door to your mind now open.

74
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,633
What's happening to me?

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,533
This is an ability of mine.

76
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:49,700
I can read people's memories and thoughts
in the form of books.

77
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:58,200
The human body remembers everything
that has ever happened to it.

78
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,600
Even if a person forgets,
the body does not.

79
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:07,133
These are 100% real memories
that can't be found in any interview.

80
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,700
This reality is what breathes life
into my work,

81
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,667
providing only the finest entertainment.

82
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,567
I CAN DO IT
WITH MY DIVING SKILLS

83
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,834
I can't have thieves like you
get in my way ever again.

84
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,367
The orders I write down
can never be disobeyed.

85
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,533
SURVEIL THE SEA FOR ROHAN

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,967
Surveil the sea for Rohan.

87
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:38,500
I can only see this as a gift from heaven,

88
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,367
but it's not as important as my talent

89
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:46,233
that uses them as material for manga.

90
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,433
AUG 14 MAN MISSING
SWEPT OUT TO SEA

91
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,200
AUG 19, 2019
SUSPENDED SEARCH FOR MAN

92
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,500
WHO WENT MISSING WHILE DIVING

93
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,066
AUG 10, 2006 - WENT MISSING
WHILE SWIMMING WITH PEERS

94
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,367
AUG 14, 1954 TWO MEN MISSING

95
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:30,066
LAST SEEN ENTERING SEA
YESTERDAY MORNING

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Mr. Rohan!

97
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,700
Sorry I'm lagging behind.

98
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,633
I spaced out
and went all the way to your house.

99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,166
Work's been crazy busy in prep
for the Bon holiday next week.

100
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,834
Things have been so hectic.
I've barely slept all week.

101
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
And my tooth has to start hurting now.

102
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:59,266
I don't even have time
to go see a dentist.

103
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,700
-For you, Miss?
-Milk tea.

104
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,767
Certainly.

105
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,033
Oh, man, it stings.

106
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:14,700
So, do you always get
deliveries and takeouts?

107
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:17,133
I've got no time to cook.

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,934
By the time I'm home, I'm wiped.
It's too much hassle.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,066
Embrace food as medicine.

110
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
What's that?

111
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:27,867
Prevention starts with
a conscious effort to eat a balanced diet.

112
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:31,667
Your body will naturally
learn to fend off diseases.

113
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,467
Since you already
don't eat a balanced diet,

114
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,767
a few hectic days
are enough to wreck your health.

115
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:41,300
What am I supposed to do
working in this industry?

116
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,633
Let's get on the same page.

117
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,367
You wanted me to come out here,

118
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,066
me, who is in the midst of
a popular serialization,

119
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:50,100
because you had a favor to ask?

120
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,900
Was it, "Can I schedule in
your next one-off?

121
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:58,433
How about a mystery horror
themed around food? Ha ha!"

122
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
Does that sound right?

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Someone with your atrocious eating habits
is unfit to supervise such a story.

124
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,900
You nailed it.

125
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,300
So why don't we go grab a delicious bite?

126
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,600
-What?
-Let's say, an early lunch.

127
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,600
Hey, hey, hey.

128
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,400
We haven't even started our meeting.

129
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,200
No formal offer either, I was--

130
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,100
I spotted a sign on the way to your house.

131
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,333
It wasn't there last week.
This restaurant must have recently opened!

132
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,166
It's rare to see an Italian restaurant
in a place like this.

133
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,333
Italian restaurant?

134
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,333
Italian cuisine is known
for its health benefits.

135
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,166
Doesn't it go along with
"Embrace food as medicine"?

136
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,367
We'll continue our meeting there.

137
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,367
Not sure when you found this sign,

138
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,100
but this was your plan all along,
wasn't it?

139
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,600
-Over there!
-Listen, you.

140
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:08,266
500M AHEAD

141
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,500
I admit it.

142
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,300
This place wasn't here before.

143
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:16,100
There aren't many
residential houses out this way.

144
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,000
An Italian restaurant in a secluded area.
Rather surprising, don't you think?

145
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,300
It must be one of those trendy
hole-in-the-wall places!

146
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,300
I have high hopes for this one!

147
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,567
AN ITALIAN MAN
APPROACHED US ABOUT ABALONE

148
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,567
"An Italian man who relocated
to an old mansion.

149
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,934
An Italian restaurant.
A strange Italian man.

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,433
He's seeking the legendary abalone,
willing to pay any price.

151
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,066
Whimper of a dog from the kitchen.
Questionable experiments."

152
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,400
Here we are.

153
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,100
What a large mansion.

154
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,700
I don't see how this can go wrong.

155
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,467
Now close it.

156
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,533
Yes, sir.

157
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Strange.

158
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,166
The sign said it's open, but…

159
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,667
Maybe they're in the back?

160
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,700
Great interior design.

161
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,233
This is weird.

162
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,300
There's only one table.

163
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,200
But there's so much room.

164
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,467
That's because I do everything by myself.

165
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:40,800
Welcome to my Trattoria.
Please take a seat.

166
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:03,033
So, are you from Italy?

167
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Yes, ma'am. I'm Tonio Trussardi.

168
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm from Napoli.

169
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,967
Tonio, where's the menu?

170
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,033
Menu?

171
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,433
You're talking about la lista.

172
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
-Yes.
-There's none.

173
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,533
What?

174
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
The dish will vary
depending on the customer.

175
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,433
It's because I examine each guest
and decide on their courses.

176
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,200
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

177
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,767
It seems…

178
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,767
you only slept three hours last night.

179
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:57,967
Additionally…

180
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,633
you have a cavity.

181
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:10,533
It's on the right side,
the second molar from the back.

182
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,734
How can you tell?

183
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,567
I can tell everything about your body
simply by examining both of your hands.

184
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,033
Your turn now.

185
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,867
Your intestinal lining is irritated.

186
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
There's more.

187
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,600
Your shoulder is stiff.

188
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,333
It's the right shoulder.

189
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,867
Is that right?

190
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,667
Yes.

191
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,567
That's impressive.

192
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,934
Could you be the famous Kishibe Rohan?

193
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:54,100
-Yes I am.
-No!

194
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,667
Your work, Pink Dark Boy,
is cherished in Italy too.

195
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,900
I'm a lifelong fan myself.

196
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,667
-World-famous, Mr. Rohan.
-Zip it.

197
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,867
Oh, pardon my rudeness.

198
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,066
There's no time to chitchat.

199
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,266
I should be flipping pans in the kitchen.

200
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:15,867
You two are my very first customers.

201
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,967
Let me give you special treatment.

202
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,533
I've never been to a restaurant
without a menu.

203
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
What a strange restaurant.

204
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,500
I wonder what dishes he'll make.

205
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:42,767
Mr. Rohan?

206
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,133
What is it? Is it the toothache?

207
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,066
This water…

208
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,266
I've never had such delicious water
in my entire life!

209
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,967
It's refined, yet refreshing
all at the same time!

210
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:07,800
If I must say, it's befitting of
a princess plucking a harp in the Alps.

211
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,900
Or the first sip of water after wandering
in the desert for three whole days.

212
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,033
You're right.

213
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,066
Just exquisite!

214
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,867
Wait…

215
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,667
It's so delicious, I'm tearing up.

216
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,166
I can't hold them back,
they keep pouring out.

217
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:47,967
Izumi?

218
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,533
What's happening to you?

219
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,467
My tears!

220
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,033
-My tears!
-One moment, please.

221
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,567
Please calm down.
This reaction is only temporary.

222
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:16,633
This water is 50,000-year old
melted snow from Mt. Kilimanjaro.

223
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:22,400
It cleanses out your eyes
and treats sleep deprivation.

224
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,467
This didn't happen to you, Mr. Rohan,

225
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,433
because you got
a full night's rest last night.

226
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,600
What do you mean?

227
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,133
Mr. Rohan.

228
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,133
I feel refreshed.

229
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,767
It's like I slept on the most
comfortable bed for 10 hours straight.

230
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,200
I feel revitalized.

231
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
For you.

232
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,567
Why did I gush out like that?

233
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,967
I feel great though.

234
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,800
Mr. Rohan, do you really have
a sour stomach and a stiff shoulder?

235
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,133
Yes. I've been playing too much

236
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,667
with the frisbee you got for Bakin
without my knowledge.

237
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,166
As for the indigestion,

238
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:30,967
I blame the greasy Chinese food I had
with your bosses last night.

239
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:35,600
Wow, even you have bouts of malaise.

240
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:11,667
The antipasto is
mozzarella and tomato caprese salad.

241
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:18,000
Italians were the first to incorporate
tomatoes in their cuisine.

242
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,867
No one can compete
when it comes to using tomatoes in a dish.

243
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,867
This isn't a lousy boast.

244
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,967
I take pride in it.

245
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:37,600
I serve the kind of recipes that
are passed down from mother to child.

246
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,600
Dishes that have accompanied
the ebb and flow of Italian history.

247
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Pride, right.

248
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,667
Sorry to insist after
you've poured your heart out to us,

249
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:53,934
but will you take the first bite,

250
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
right this minute, right here?

251
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:09,800
Yes, sir. My pleasure.

252
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:33,100
Well then. Enjoy.

253
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,867
Absolutely fantastic.

254
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
This dish…

255
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,633
As simple as it seems,
its flavor is rich and deep.

256
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,633
The cheese and tomato
complement each other perfectly.

257
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,567
It's a Simon and Garfunkel duo.

258
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,500
Tetsuya Chiba's manga
of author Ikki Kajiwara's Ashita no Joe!

259
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,333
Precisely so.

260
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,934
The flavors work in harmony
to reach new heights.

261
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,967
Thank you. I'm honored
you regard my dish so highly.

262
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,567
My shoulders…

263
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:47,867
Mr. Rohan?

264
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,533
What just came off?

265
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,700
That's your dead skin.

266
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,433
Dead skin?

267
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:16,667
All that peeling just means that
the increased metabolism

268
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,467
is improving your blood circulation.

269
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,834
It itches!

270
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,700
Mr. Rohan!

271
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,133
It won't stop!

272
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,433
You're almost there.

273
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,400
Mr. Rohan!

274
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
It feels light.

275
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:31,200
It's as if a balloon is
lifting up my shoulder.

276
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,800
The stiffness…

277
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,367
It's gone!

278
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:44,800
I'm ever so glad.

279
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,800
It's amazing, but…

280
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,934
also frightening.

281
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,800
The Primo Piatto is
spaghetti alla puttanesca.

282
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,767
Is something the matter?

283
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,100
-Tonio.
-Yes?

284
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,367
I've never had water and caprese
quite like yours,

285
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
but…

286
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,734
I'm getting full.

287
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:50,367
I think I'm ready for the check.

288
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,800
I don't really like spicy peppers.

289
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,500
Don't worry,

290
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:03,266
even people who can't handle spicy
can still enjoy my pasta.

291
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,033
I'm so sorry.

292
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,700
I understand.

293
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,533
I'm sorry my cooking didn't satisfy you.

294
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,600
Don't bother with the payment,
it's on the house.

295
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,867
Izumi, could you…

296
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,133
wait here for a minute?

297
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:50,734
Sorry.

298
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,633
I couldn't hold myself back.

299
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,667
It's good. It's too good.

300
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,567
I don't even like peppers.

301
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,967
What can I say, it's addicting.

302
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,667
It's like I'm drawn to it,
and my appetite gets all worked up.

303
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,767
The more I eat, the hungrier I get.

304
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
This must be…

305
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,200
your cavity.

306
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:45,767
Izumi.

307
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:50,100
-Jaw! My jaw!
-Hey!

308
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,600
A new tooth grew in!

309
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,667
Impossible.

310
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,233
How can this even happen?

311
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,200
What's happening to me?

312
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,700
What's this?

313
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,533
I know it.

314
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,567
They are found only by the Sea of Okhotsk
in the Kamchatka Peninsula.

315
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,333
Poisonous whelk.

316
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,867
It's highly poisonous,
and the locals don't eat it.

317
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:37,834
Its ingestion is prohibited.
It's a banned shell.

318
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,500
Poisonous?

319
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,567
Did we just ingest food made with poison?

320
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,333
That's what it seems like.

321
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:54,200
The water and even the caprese?

322
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,300
I knew it was irresistible.

323
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,166
Is your tooth all better now?

324
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:08,633
Tonio…

325
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:12,967
Is this some sort of
sick human experiment?

326
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,066
Please tell me--

327
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,100
you don't plan on killing us.

328
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:30,233
Now, I brought the main dish,
stewed lamb and mushroom.

329
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:38,934
These mushrooms…

330
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,133
Devil's porcini.

331
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:45,834
These are sourced
from the Czech-Polish border.

332
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
-Are they poisonous?
-Of course.

333
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:49,400
You're kidding!

334
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,867
The poison in the mushroom…

335
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,433
Muscarine, anatoxin, trichothecene…

336
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,200
It's an exhibition of poison.

337
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,600
Ingestion causes indigestion,
seizure, vomiting,

338
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,166
and in some cases…

339
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,734
death.

340
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:09,133
It's as you say, Mr. Rohan.
You sure are knowledgeable.

341
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,166
Mr. Rohan?

342
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,867
You can't, Mr. Rohan. Don't!

343
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:08,166
Mr. Rohan!

344
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,266
Mr. Rohan?

345
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,934
Are you okay, Mr. Rohan?

346
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,934
Talk to me. Are you okay?

347
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,300
I've never felt better.

348
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:20,700
What?

349
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,967
I feel full, but also--

350
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,834
light and refreshed all at once!

351
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,667
I'm glad to hear.

352
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,500
How the…

353
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:33,066
But, the poison…

354
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,133
At times,

355
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,900
poison acts as medicine.

356
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,233
Poison acts as medicine?

357
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:47,066
Nitroglycerin, the main ingredient
in bombs, is used to treat angina.

358
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:52,500
Morphine, used to make illegal drugs,
is used in anesthesia and pain relief.

359
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,667
In other words…

360
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:57,066
even deadly poison

361
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,467
can become life-saving medicine
if used correctly in the right dosage.

362
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,367
Tonio must be an expert

363
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,967
in all sorts of toxins from animals
and plants around the world.

364
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,934
He uses just the right amount
to heal sicknesses.

365
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,133
Embracing food as medicine.

366
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:21,100
He is really
a master of medicinal cuisine.

367
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,300
He's trained in all schools of herbology,
from Eastern medicine,

368
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:31,834
Africa's wildflowers and plants, and
the art of medicine men in the Amazons.

369
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:37,066
So you've figured out
my secret ingredient.

370
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,266
It didn't come all at once.

371
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,934
Though, I had a gut feeling
it's something like this.

372
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:50,934
The final dish was completely up to luck.

373
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:58,967
The Sicilian basil on the caprese is fake.

374
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,600
This herb is highly poisonous,

375
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,800
but when paired
with olive oil from the Rhodes,

376
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:10,133
the toxin is neutralized as one's
metabolism is drastically increased.

377
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,867
The chemical reaction between tetramine,
the whelk's deadly poison,

378
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:19,633
and the capsaicin in Nicaraguan peppers

379
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,633
form a compound with mind-blowing
antibacterial properties.

380
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,934
As for the main dish, by serving
devil's porcini with lamb from Normandy,

381
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,400
the dish releases digestive enzymes

382
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,500
that get rid of harmful gut bacteria.

383
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,967
It's the best defense against
stomach irritation.

384
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:43,667
I didn't get any of that,
but it sure sounds awesome.

385
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:51,900
Did your dog have an upset stomach too?

386
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,734
How did you guess?

387
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:01,367
You see, my Angelo scarfed down
too much food

388
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:04,100
and upset his tummy.

389
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:10,066
For two whole days, I fed him
the same lamb dish you're eating now.

390
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,300
Thanks to that,
he's back to being a happy puppy.

391
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:15,700
Tell me,

392
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,967
how did you know what was wrong with us?

393
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:22,767
It's all because of…

394
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,967
a miracle I experienced.

395
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
A miracle?

396
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:33,800
It was five years ago.

397
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:38,300
I had accidentally drank
a dangerous amount

398
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,600
of scorpion venom in Mexico.

399
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,066
I lost consciousness
and suffered from high fever.

400
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:50,633
But miraculously,

401
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,400
the fever suddenly subsided

402
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,333
after a week of bed rest.

403
00:34:57,433 --> 00:35:00,100
When I woke up,

404
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,667
I had somehow gotten this strange ability.

405
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,433
Now, I can tell a person's ailments

406
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,667
just by examining their hands.

407
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:18,066
This ability has greatly
enhanced my cooking too.

408
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:20,166
Wow.

409
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:24,000
Strange things like that really happen.

410
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,967
It was what you'd call
blessings from heaven.

411
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:33,133
With this newfound ability,
I plunged myself into research

412
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,266
and came up with a variety of recipes.

413
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:41,867
All so that my dishes
can help people feel better…

414
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,033
and live a comfortable life.

415
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,433
Thank you. See you again.

416
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:03,367
I don't mean to stick my nose
where it doesn't belong,

417
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,200
but what is a talented chef like you
doing in Japan?

418
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,767
With your skill set,
I'm sure you'll succeed in Italy.

419
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,667
Why would you--

420
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:20,867
open a restaurant in a foreign country,
let alone all the way out here?

421
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:24,166
He's right.

422
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,100
Does it have to do with abalone?

423
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Abalone?

424
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:34,200
How did you know?

425
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,000
Should you be up?

426
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,533
Yes. I feel a little better now.

427
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,367
I'm Hatsune Morishima.

428
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:02,700
I'm a patisserie,
but I'm currently on medical leave.

429
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:10,367
My disease is the reason Tonio opened
his restaurant in a place like this.

430
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:12,633
Your disease?

431
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,066
You must be wondering,

432
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:21,867
"Why can't you use your cooking
to heal what's wrong with her?"

433
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:24,734
Well…

434
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:33,367
There's a tumor
the size of a grapefruit inside my head.

435
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,967
Two years ago,

436
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,467
Tonio came to Japan
to study medicinal cuisine.

437
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,700
That was when we first met.

438
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,166
We found out about my tumor
shortly afterwards.

439
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,367
Tonio poured his knowledge,
experience, and everything he can

440
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,667
and made me one of his special dishes.

441
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,300
But it didn't work.

442
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,200
That's when I recalled
a strange rumor I heard

443
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:13,567
while visiting Taiwan.

444
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,834
It was about a mythical Japanese abalone

445
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:22,934
with the power to heal any sickness.

446
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:26,133
Then, last month,

447
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:31,567
I finally found a clue
near the fishing village in this area.

448
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:34,867
Hyogara…

449
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:36,166
Yes, I've heard of 'em.

450
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,667
The Hyogara black abalone.

451
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,900
Young man, that's what you're lookin' for?

452
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:49,867
Those precious mollusks only live
in Hyogara Rocks' southern inlet.

453
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:52,800
They are as rare as they come.

454
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:57,333
Not a single soul can access that place.

455
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:04,400
You can even call them
legendary abalone for what it's worth.

456
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,467
Geez!

457
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:08,100
Legendary abalone?

458
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,200
I pleaded with him

459
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:16,266
and told him that I have to find it,
no matter the cost.

460
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,467
I know. Rumor goes that
there's one day out of the year

461
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:25,800
when you have the chance
to harvest the precious thing.

462
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:29,967
On this day,
the abalone get "drunk", if you will,

463
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:35,367
and leave the Hyogara Rocks.

464
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:38,667
This story has
been passed down for centuries,

465
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,533
so the details are lost.

466
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:46,600
If I could just buy one, I would.

467
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,900
My hearing's shot.

468
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:53,133
Eatin' one of those abalone
may just take care of it.

469
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:03,200
I searched for someone who could
tell me more about the prized abalone,

470
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,066
but there was no one like that.

471
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,133
I'm content with
how hard Tonio tried to help me.

472
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,800
Even his cooking can't cure me,
so I've accepted that I'm fated to die.

473
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:24,867
Hatsune, you can't give up hope.

474
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,500
Funny enough,

475
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:35,467
I was also digging
into this abalone's legend

476
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,900
for a different reason.

477
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:43,266
I found this 17th-century document
at an antique bookstore.

478
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,367
It's a collection of food-related
legends and myths from this region.

479
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:52,200
It includes an anecdote about
the prized all-curing mollusks

480
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:55,467
and how to catch them.

481
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,166
What?

482
00:40:57,867 --> 00:40:59,200
Is there really?

483
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:05,233
In August, on the full moon nearest
to Bon festival at the witching hour,

484
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,000
all the abalone lose sense of up and down
due to the moon's pull on the current

485
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:12,300
and they get "drunk."

486
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,266
They then wander out of the Hyogara Rocks.

487
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,500
It was true!

488
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,767
It corroborates the fisherman's story.

489
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,033
The next full moon is…

490
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,433
in two days!

491
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,033
Mr. Rohan, you have my thanks.

492
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:37,967
With this, I know I can cure
Hatsune's tumor.

493
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,667
Although…

494
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:48,834
In Japan, it's illegal to harvest
abalone without a permit.

495
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,266
Don't do this, Tonio.

496
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,367
You can't break the law for me…

497
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,767
Hatsune!

498
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,834
Are you okay, Hatsune?

499
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,567
Is she all right?

500
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:20,700
Yes. I gave her
some medication to stabilize.

501
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,800
She's fast asleep now.

502
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:34,667
Mr. Rohan,

503
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:39,734
will you go harvest abalone with me?

504
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,633
You seem to be an expert
on these mollusks.

505
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:56,834
Give me a break.

506
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:01,066
Did anything I said get through to you?

507
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,834
You're asking me to break the law.

508
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,900
I'll harvest the abalone.

509
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,700
All you have to do is take me there.

510
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:16,133
Come on now.

511
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,900
That's it? I'm just gonna be your guide?

512
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:24,734
I'm a manga artist
for wholesome boys and girls.

513
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,000
You see, I happen to be a little famous.

514
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:31,367
I've heard that abalone larvae take
five full years to reach maturity

515
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,567
after they are released into the ocean.

516
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:38,400
Not to mention, this variety of abalone
is especially rare and protected.

517
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,867
Imagine the repercussions
if we got caught.

518
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,533
I accept the risks.

519
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,400
Danger accompanies the night sea.

520
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,934
I've read articles that multiple people
have gone missing in that bay.

521
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,633
You may lose your life.

522
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,967
I'm going to poach.

523
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,467
That's why I like you.

524
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:07,767
Good.

525
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,667
I'll help you.

526
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:10,967
Mr. Rohan!

527
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,533
Thank you.

528
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,133
No need to thank me.

529
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,066
This is for my curiosity.

530
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,200
Hyogara Rocks lies
on the other side of that cape.

531
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,033
The sacred inlet where
the legendary abalone nest.

532
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,700
According to the ancient document,

533
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:51,900
just for tonight,
the abalone lose sense of direction

534
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:54,467
due to the full moon's effect
on the current.

535
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:58,266
They detach from the rocks
and get washed ashore here.

536
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,600
That means we won't have to go underwater,

537
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,467
and we don't need knives or other tools.

538
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:09,233
We'll catch them with our bare hands
and toss them into this basket.

539
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:12,667
This method has no risks
and we won't leave any trace.

540
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:15,967
Quite thought-out for a poaching method.

541
00:45:17,266 --> 00:45:18,667
A little too thought-out.

542
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:25,900
Whether in Japan or Italy,
we can rely on our forefathers' wisdom.

543
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,100
Abalone are nocturnal.

544
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:49,000
They spend the day sticking to cliffsides
and feasting on seaweed such as kelp.

545
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:51,467
Once they feel threatened,
they cling onto rocks.

546
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:55,734
Hit them with a hammer or run them over
with a car, they won't crack open.

547
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,333
The shell has a little opening
they use for breathing

548
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,133
as well as releasing waste and sperm.

549
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,367
Its natural predator is…

550
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,567
Something just moved!

551
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,433
Something rubbed against me too.

552
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:26,700
What…

553
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:29,734
is this?

554
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:33,633
They're actually swimming.

555
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:39,300
There are so many of them.

556
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:40,567
They're swarming us!

557
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,200
They're huge.

558
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,667
It's heavy.

559
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,900
So this is the legendary abalone.

560
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:58,900
Tonio.

561
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:01,200
Let's grab some and go.

562
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:11,633
Tonio?

563
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:14,967
Tonio!

564
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,600
Tonio Trussardi!

565
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,667
I don't believe this.

566
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:38,667
He couldn't have drowned
in this shallow water.

567
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:57,734
This is bad.

568
00:47:58,867 --> 00:47:59,867
Really bad.

569
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:02,467
Darn it.

570
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:11,867
If I don't pry it off, he'll asphyxiate!

571
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:57,066
Abalone's shell won't crack open,

572
00:48:57,133 --> 00:49:00,500
even if you hit them with a hammer
or run them over with a car.

573
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:03,500
The more they feel under threat,
the stronger they cling on.

574
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,667
This is bad.

575
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,900
I have to do something. And fast!

576
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,166
There's no way to fight back.

577
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,066
I'm going to drown.

578
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:20,967
This place…

579
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:29,100
is a graveyard.

580
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,367
TWO MISSING
ENTERED SEA YESTERDAY MORNING

581
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,133
MISSING

582
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,000
The abalone clings

583
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:42,700
onto anyone who comes here to poach.

584
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:45,667
They drift ashore onto this island…

585
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:49,400
and get carried here.

586
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:58,567
Abalone have long been
sacred offerings for Gods

587
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:01,233
since they are said to grant longevity.

588
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:06,367
Out of all the abalone, the Hyogara Rocks'
black abalone are the most prized.

589
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:11,934
Poaching these sacred abalone
is an offense punishable by death.

590
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,900
It's a trap.

591
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,667
The poachers who read the document

592
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,200
are lured to this island,

593
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,133
where they meet their end.

594
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:28,033
It was all a trap!

595
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,100
This is bad.

596
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:56,633
At this rate…

597
00:51:58,233 --> 00:51:59,600
At this rate, I'll…

598
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,500
That's it.

599
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,066
Don't underestimate Kishibe Rohan.

600
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,600
Heaven's Door.

601
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:25,200
Enjoy your plate.

602
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:45,767
Who knew octopus could be so decadent?

603
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:49,033
It's a perfect medley of sweet and sour,

604
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:52,200
along with the octopus's unique flavor.

605
00:52:56,834 --> 00:53:00,100
Abalone's natural predator is…

606
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:06,900
ATTACK THE ABALONE NOW!
IMMEDIATELY!

607
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:09,834
Octopus.

608
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Say,

609
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,567
how's Hatsune doing?

610
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:29,333
She's getting better.

611
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:33,934
This octopus's healing properties are
just as potent as the black abalone's.

612
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:38,533
I served her the same dish earlier.

613
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,133
She's sound asleep right now.

614
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:42,934
Is that so?

615
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,934
I'm optimistic about this time.

616
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:56,700
It devoured copious amounts
of Hyogara black abalone.

617
00:53:56,767 --> 00:54:01,066
Without a doubt, this octopus
has absorbed their healing properties.

618
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:16,166
Turns out the legend of the abalone
under a full moon was just that, a legend.

619
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,500
It's an old tale.

620
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:26,633
From the moment I read this,

621
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,667
I was hung up on why the poaching method

622
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:35,400
was written in great detail
in a book meant for the general public.

623
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:40,333
The ultimate way to fend off poachers.

624
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,000
That's how I make sense of it.

625
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:48,166
The legend of the abalone
under a full moon itself is

626
00:54:48,233 --> 00:54:51,200
a carefully laid trap
meant to finish off poachers.

627
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,400
A beautiful work of art that leaves
no evidence or bodies behind.

628
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:58,567
Here lies our forefathers' wisdom,

629
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:01,633
and their pride.

630
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
I've got to tell you,

631
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:12,300
I would've liked to try
these Zogara black abalone.

632
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:15,734
Try again.

633
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:17,767
-The Zogara--
-Hyogara.

634
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,900
-Ms. Hatsune!
-Hatsune!

635
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:30,133
Beautiful.

636
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,767
I baked the dessert.

637
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,333
Why don't we enjoy it together?

638
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,166
Will you, Tonio?

639
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,333
This is the same recipe my mama made
when I was a little boy.

640
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,767
Crossed tarta.

641
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,834
I've traveled all around the world

642
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,300
and tried all sorts of cuisine.

643
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:59,533
To this day, I haven't found anything

644
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:04,133
that tastes more delicious
than my mama's crossed tarta.

645
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:09,400
Tonio and I promised that
one of these days,

646
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:12,734
we'll bake his mom's
crossed tarta recipe together.

647
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,767
And today was that day.

648
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:20,367
It's mouth-watering.

649
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,133
It smells wonderful.

650
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,633
Now, let's dig in.

651
00:56:36,266 --> 00:56:37,266
Thank you.

652
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,233
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

653
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:15,800
Yum!

654
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,300
I'm so happy for them.

655
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,967
What a graceful couple.

656
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,200
They got a happily ever after.

657
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:27,767
I'm calling it now,
people will stand in line for his dish.

658
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,266
I'm gonna tell all my friends about it.

659
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:34,000
Although a part of me
wants to keep it to myself too.

660
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:37,200
Oh, about that mystery horror one-off
themed around food.

661
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:40,400
It has to take place in Italy,
the country of cuisine!

662
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:42,266
It'll be perfect.

663
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,333
We have our
next business trip destination!

664
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:48,934
Mr. Rohan?

665
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,133
-Mr. Rohan?
-Don't speak.

666
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,967
Mutsukabe blue frogs.

667
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,233
They're mating.

668
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:01,900
Come again?

669
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:06,000
You're dismissed. Go.

670
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,600
Where?

671
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,166
Can't see them.

672
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:12,600
I said go.

673
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,734
Leave now.

674
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:22,433
Lame.

675
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:28,467
Oh well.
