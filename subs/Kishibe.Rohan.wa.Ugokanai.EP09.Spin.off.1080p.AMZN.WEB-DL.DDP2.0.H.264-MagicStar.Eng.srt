1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:05,533
AROUND THE SAME TIME
ROHAN AND TONIO

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,734
MAKE THEIR WAY TO HYOGARA ROCKS

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,433
I feel terrible

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,033
that I get you entangled in my mess.

5
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,734
Don't you worry.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,000
I should be the one apologizing
that the most I can do

7
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,066
is sip tea with you.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,166
I appreciate your company.

9
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,567
What a sweet aroma.

10
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,266
It's tasty.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,533
Speaking of scent,

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
Tonio's cooking

13
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,867
is not only very delicious,

14
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,934
but it also smells wonderful.

15
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:08,133
It's not that it smells special
or anything,

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,467
but more that it makes me feel calm

17
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,333
and a little nostalgic.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,767
Just one whiff

19
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,734
and I can't help but reach for my fork.

20
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,233
Izumi.

21
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:28,667
Can you recall the moment you were born?

22
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:29,734
What?

23
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,633
You mean, when I was a baby?

24
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:37,100
Sorry,
that's a little too far back for me.

25
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,667
I remember

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,500
the day I was born.

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,433
Wow.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,734
To be specific,

29
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,567
I remember the scent of it.

30
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,433
The scent of your birth?

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,800
I was born in an old hospital
over a century old

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,100
tucked in the mountains
of the Shikoku region.

33
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,567
It was a November morning

34
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:11,333
when the doctor scooped me up
and I felt the fresh breeze.

35
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:16,033
I remember being surrounded
by the sweet scent of raspberries.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,266
It's a sweet, tart,

37
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,166
and a little nostalgic scent.

38
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,934
Isn't it silly,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
a newborn thinking a scent is nostalgic?

40
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:33,066
That scent stimulated my appetite,

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
and I clutched on to my mother's breast.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,266
My grandmother saw this
and laughed and said…

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,266
"Oh dear. This one is fond of eating.

44
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,467
She might grow up to love cooking."

45
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,400
Wow.

46
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,900
You remember it that clearly?

47
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,567
You must think I'm spouting nonsense.

48
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,967
No, I believe you.

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,767
I've had nothing but strange encounters

50
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,333
since I became Mr. Rohan's editor.

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,467
Just as my grandma thought,
I grew up to love cooking food.

52
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,367
That's why I became a patisserie.

53
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:28,967
Then, two years ago, I met Tonio.

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,700
Back then,

55
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:37,867
I was suffering from hay fever
and had a terribly stuffy nose.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,066
It's a serious problem for any chef.

57
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,433
That's when Tonio

58
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,700
made a lasagna to console me.

59
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,900
I still remember
the jolt that ran through me

60
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,066
when I first saw his cooking.

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,133
Though I couldn't smell,

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,834
I definitely smelled
that scent from his lasagna.

63
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,734
That scent?

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Right.

65
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,967
That irresistible scent that stirs hunger

66
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,400
but also calms you down at the same time.

67
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,700
The same scent as the day I was born.

68
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:26,433
That warm and gentle smell.

69
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,834
Like that feeling

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,400
of sipping
your mother's homemade miso soup at home?

71
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:39,934
He said, in Italy, lasagna
is the taste of the mother's cooking.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,300
Wow, is it really?

73
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,100
Tonio's lasagna healed my allergies.

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,467
There's something really magical
about Tonio's cooking.

75
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,166
But to me,

76
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,867
it's the smell from his cooking

77
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:08,667
that's truly precious and endearing.

78
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,166
You know,

79
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,800
I bet he pours his kind personality

80
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,867
and all the affection he feels

81
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:23,233
for his family and loved ones

82
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,266
into his dishes.

83
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,233
When I stand next to him in the kitchen,

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,467
I forget the flow of time.

85
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,700
My dream is to bake treats

86
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:45,400
that smell just as sweet and tart
as Tonio's cooking.

87
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:48,000
I love that.

88
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,433
All this talk worked up my appetite.

89
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:05,300
My appetite really is twice the size
of anyone else's.

90
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,533
I can cook something easy

91
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,700
if you'd like.

92
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:12,934
Oh, but--

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,433
Right.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,066
Snacking at night is bad for beauty.

95
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,734
Let's not.

96
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,800
When Tonio and Mr. Rohan get back,

97
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,834
it might be time for breakfast.

98
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,900
I just want them to come back unharmed.

99
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,800
They don't even need
to bring back any abalone.

100
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,767
Before my grandmother passed away,

101
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:59,233
I was overcome with sadness
and anxiously asked her this:

102
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,333
"Grandma,
will you become a star after you die?"

103
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:12,300
My grandmother smiled and replied…

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
"Some become stars,

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
some become butterflies.

106
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,900
And others even become raspberries.

107
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,767
No matter what they become,
they stay close to their loved ones

108
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,300
and watch over them.

109
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,467
Even after I die, you won't be alone.

110
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:41,300
I'll always be by your side, Hatsune."

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Even now.

112
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:57,567
They say there's one fate
that's inevitable as much as inescapable.

113
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,433
One day, we will die.

114
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:07,667
But if it's as my grandma says,

115
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,000
then I don't fear death.

116
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:13,600
Every day, I try to live my life
to the fullest

117
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,333
so that when my time comes…

118
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,734
I won't have any regrets.

119
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:25,867
I met Tonio.

120
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,300
I tasted his dishes.

121
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,000
I even cooked alongside him.

122
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:40,300
Just with these moments of joy,
I've lived the happiest life.

123
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,533
Even after I pass on,

124
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,700
as long as Tonio is alive and well…

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,734
I can stay by his side and watch over him.

126
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,834
I prattled on.

127
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,333
Ms. Hatsune.

129
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,934
Recently, my schedule has been so hectic

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
that I haven't had time for proper meals.

131
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,600
That's when I had Tonio's cooking,
and it deeply touched me.

132
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,433
Then this thought came to me.

133
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:35,667
Earlier, you said
that death is inevitable.

134
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:39,033
One thing that's for certain
is that we'll all die one day.

135
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:42,433
Yes.

136
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,133
But I believe something else
is equally important in life.

137
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,066
Something else?

138
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,166
Enjoying food.

139
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,066
I think that living a life
you don't regret

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,800
has to mean that
you thoroughly enjoy delicious food.

141
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:03,900
I think that's really important.

142
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,967
The dish doesn't have to be elaborate.

143
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:13,066
It's important
to enjoy food made with love every day,

144
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:19,834
whether it's for yourself or someone else.

145
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Izumi.

146
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,066
Sorry to sound like a know-it-all.

147
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,967
I haven't touched a pan in a while,

148
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,300
and I don't have
a wide repertoire of recipes.

149
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,300
Who cares,
as long as you pour your heart into it?

150
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:42,734
Exactly.

151
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,900
Now I'm really hungry.

152
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,734
They'll be back soon.

153
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:02,166
Mr. Rohan might come off
as lofty and full of confidence,

154
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
but for some reason, he's very reliable.

155
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,934
And he never fails to deliver.

156
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,533
So we can entrust it to him.

157
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,233
Wow, now…

158
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,467
I'm starting to smell breakfast.

159
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,900
Café au lait and sugary biscuits.

160
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,533
Tonio's brioche is exceptional too.

161
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,967
I can't wait to try!
Brioche is one of my favorites.

162
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,433
I just got a whiff of wild strawberries.

163
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:56,734
Me too.
