1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>Those gigantic orifices
appeared suddenly.</i>

2
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>A total of seven orifices.</i>

3
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>When?</i>

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,485
<i>How?</i>

5
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>Where do they lead to?</i>

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,783
<i>What could these orifices possibly be?</i>

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,621
Whoa…

8
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,750
Even from this distance
you can tell it's huge.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,502
Up close, it's probably
as tall as a building.

10
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,055
This is one of the orifices
that suddenly appeared.

11
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,392
Workers are currently
blocking off the area.

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>Investigations into the orifices</i>

13
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>have been ongoing for
about three and a half years.</i>

14
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>Seventeen investigators
entered the orifices</i>

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>but none returned.</i>

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>However,</i>

17
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>their tethers extending
out of the orifices are</i>

18
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>proof that they are still alive.</i>

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,953
How can they still be alive?

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,081
Why don't they come back?

21
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,250
Thank you for your questions.

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,171
Based on the current results
from our investigations,

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,632
we haven't been able to obtain
definitive information

24
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,468
on the depth of the orifices
or if they are connected.

25
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,347
Therefore, we have decided
to terminate our investigations.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,306
-What?
-What?

27
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,559
If an orifice is deemed to be compatible
with the local area

28
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,772
and considerations are made regarding
its impact on safety and the environment,

29
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,067
it may be recognized
as part of the landscape.

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,070
<i>Once the blockade
around the orifices was lifted,</i>

31
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>people began to interact
with them in various ways.</i>

32
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,993
<i>All sorts of theories spread,</i>

33
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,622
<i>and many ventured inside.</i>

34
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,292
<i>Eventually, there appeared a man
who worshipped them as deities.</i>

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,003
<i>His name was Ozawa.</i>

36
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,421
The orifices are

37
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,758
a place that relieves you from distress.

38
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,553
No one has returned from the orifices.

39
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,972
Which means, in the orifices,

40
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,266
you will find liberation.

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,685
The question is,

42
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,229
how should we enter the orifices?

43
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,776
<i>In kindergarten, Ozawa would look for
oddly-shaped pine cones</i>

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,862
<i>and throw them from the jungle gym.</i>

45
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,905
<i>By making others pick them up,</i>

46
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,117
<i>he gained status in his class.</i>

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,870
<i>But that is another story.</i>

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>The organization led by Ozawa</i>

49
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:58,553
<i>designated December 1st through the 30th
as the Festival of the Orifices.</i>

50
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:04,225
<i>Interested individuals were allowed
to enter the orifices during that period.</i>

51
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>Before entering an orifice,</i>

52
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,941
<i>each person was to document their reasons.</i>

53
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,235
<i>To abide by those instructions,</i>

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>eight people gathered
at this lodging owned by Ozawa.</i>

55
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,607
-Let's eat.
-Great job, everyone.

56
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,984
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,721
Shall we start?

58
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,849
Some of us might want
to get it over with today.

59
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,309
-Well…
-Yeah.

60
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,939
Should we start with those
who are planning to enter early?

61
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,232
-Right.
-Good idea.

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,486
I'm scheduled for the 21st.

63
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,323
I'm scheduled for the 13th,
so I'm before you.

64
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,075
Anyone scheduled before that?

65
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,203
I know what week
but I haven't set a date yet.

66
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,164
I'm going before her, though.

67
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,960
I don't have a set date either

68
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,337
because I'm still undecided.

69
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,798
I'm scheduled for the 6th.

70
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,843
-Then, you might be the first.
-Yes.

71
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,263
I'll tell my story first, then.

72
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,978
Okay…

73
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:22,947
All set.

74
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,116
Okay.

75
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,827
Um…

76
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,041
When I was in elementary school,

77
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,544
I started playing soccer
after watching a match

78
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,920
on a sports channel.

79
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,176
My father wanted me to engage
in some form of physical activity,

80
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,012
so I'd been taking swimming lessons
since kindergarten.

81
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,181
But I didn't really like it.

82
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,100
Soccer was the first sport

83
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,604
I felt like trying out
on my own initiative.

84
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,526
Whenever I had time on weekends,
I used to practice with my father.

85
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,489
My father had experience
in all kinds of sports

86
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,866
and was pretty athletic.

87
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,786
<i>Among second graders,</i>

88
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,706
<i>Kawabata had decent soccer skills.</i>

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,335
<i>However, since he joined the team late,</i>

90
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:23,174
<i>he was not prioritized during matches
and he never got much playing time.</i>

91
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,414
Do you see where I'm standing?

92
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,250
Yeah.

93
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,544
Where did the ball go?

94
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,172
Yeah…

95
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,967
That's no answer.
I'm asking you where the ball is.

96
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
Where is it?

97
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,689
When will you be able to play properly?

98
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,649
We're done for today.

99
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,172
Hey, Kawabata!

100
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,675
<i>After quitting soccer,</i>

101
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,095
<i>Kawabata started to hang out
with Teppei and Yuki.</i>

102
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,041
Whoa!

103
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,835
It's your fault!

104
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,925
There goes the cola-splashing hag again.

105
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,302
Iizuka got splashed the other day too.

106
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,430
It's a waste of money to buy cola
just to splash it on people.

107
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,599
Are you okay?
Do you want to go wash it off?

108
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,017
I'm okay.

109
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,019
Let's keep playing catch.

110
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,271
You two have a game coming up tomorrow,

111
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,481
so let's practice.

112
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,616
<i>One day,</i>

113
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:58,371
<i>Kawabata realized
that his favorite eraser was missing.</i>

114
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,836
The eraser had
trading card characters on it.

115
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,256
I had that eraser too.

116
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,759
I wondered where I'd lost it.

117
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,553
And…

118
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,556
Did you drop it somewhere?

119
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,432
It wasn't in the lost and found box.

120
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,227
Did you look in your school bag?

121
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,020
I did but it wasn't in there.

122
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,772
And your desk drawer?

123
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,690
I looked.

124
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,607
Hm…

125
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,735
They might not sell the same one anymore.

126
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,473
Who was it?

127
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,100
Someone found it.

128
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,478
Who?

129
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,188
That doesn't matter.

130
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,567
It's smaller than it was before.

131
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,153
Someone probably stole it
and came to return it.

132
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,782
You're a boy, so go retaliate.

133
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,662
In the end, I didn't retaliate.

134
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:26,667
But, whenever I faced unfair treatment
in my junior high school baseball club,

135
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,712
my father always told me to fight back.

136
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>Even in junior high school
and high school,</i>

137
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,551
<i>Kawabata never became angry.</i>

138
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>Eventually, Kawabata went to college</i>

139
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,485
<i>and found a girlfriend.</i>

140
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,428
Why were you late?
I was waiting for two hours.

141
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:25,226
But I'm totally fine
if you're two hours late. I can wait.

142
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,143
Huh?

143
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,355
Um, I'm asking for
the reason you were late.

144
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,691
I don't care if you're late,

145
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,111
so it's fine if you run late.

146
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,028
Um…

147
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,697
I see…

148
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,782
Exactly.

149
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,741
Thanks.

150
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,953
Why won't you get mad about that?

151
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,001
Apparently, she stays out
till morning every day.

152
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,003
Even if he tells her
to stop it, she won't.

153
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,215
You'd cover her in mayonnaise
while she's sleeping, right, Akira?

154
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,801
Did you ask her
why she stays out all night?

155
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,971
She said, "I'm not doing
anything suspicious."

156
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,348
But this concerns both of you.

157
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,726
Isn't her reaction to your question weird?

158
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,271
You don't like it,

159
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,691
so she should stop being late
if she wants to keep seeing you.

160
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,443
That's what I'm trying to tell her.

161
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,862
If she knows what you mean,

162
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,031
it means she doesn't care
if you like her or not.

163
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,700
I don't think it's like that…

164
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,535
Then why won't she stop?

165
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,828
Apparently,

166
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,622
she goes on photography trips
with another guy.

167
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,875
Is she an idiot? Seriously.

168
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,086
-You're not getting through to her.
-Well…

169
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,548
Yeah, I can't deny that possibility.

170
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,467
You should get mad at her.

171
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,640
<i>Kawabata started thinking about
why he didn't feel like getting angry.</i>

172
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,436
I didn't understand
what it meant to get angry.

173
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,813
Not just about this incident.

174
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,482
I've always been like this.

175
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
I wondered how everyone else knew

176
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,946
that they were getting angry.

177
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,283
But then, I realized that

178
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:09,163
her actions did annoy me and
that's why I asked them for their opinion.

179
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,207
I started thinking that

180
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,168
maybe I actually was angry.

181
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,462
I just hadn't realized it.

182
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,131
It made me wonder if the seeds of anger

183
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,051
were already sprouting within me.

184
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,220
Maybe, I had been
unconsciously plucking them.

185
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,179
And so,

186
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,890
I started practicing being angry.

187
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,727
First, I practiced facial expressions.

188
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,447
Then, articulation.

189
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,825
Stop messing with me.

190
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,787
Stop… messing… with… me.

191
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,165
Stop messing with me.

192
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,461
Lastly, I worked out.

193
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,186
Next time she's late,
I'm going to give it to her.

194
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,298
Hey, there.

195
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,845
Did you read the book
you got at the flea market?

196
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,309
I've kept it in good condition.

197
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,104
And will you get another expensive book
for your collection today?

198
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,151
I like to display my books, you know?

199
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,800
I told myself I would do it next time
and kept practicing my anger.

200
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm still practicing,

201
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,433
but that's when the orifices appeared.

202
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,062
My mom and my dad entered
an orifice pretty early on.

203
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,940
I'm the only one left in my family.

204
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,857
Yeah…

205
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,526
Did your parents know Mr. Ozawa?

206
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,111
Yes. They told me about him.

207
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,490
I never thought I would enter
an orifice too,

208
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,325
but since my parents went,

209
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,744
I started thinking
it might not be so bad after all.

210
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,579
Did they meet with Mr. Ozawa beforehand?

211
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,497
Yes, they did.

212
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
Did you tell your girlfriend off?

213
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,836
Well, kind of…

214
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,425
The main reason
you can't get angry is likely because,

215
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,011
since childhood,
you have been seeking acceptance

216
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
from those around you,
particularly your parents.

217
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,475
That's why you have learned

218
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,646
to suppress your own desires and emotions

219
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,524
as much as possible.

220
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,404
I'm not intending to suppress my emotions…

221
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,949
There are quite a few children like that.

222
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,660
Childhood life is

223
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,955
mostly designed by parents.

224
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,792
So, kids often try
to not inconvenience their parents.

225
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,545
They try to convince themselves that

226
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,257
what their parents want them to do
is what they want to do.

227
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:56,974
Even as you grew up,
a part of you believed that,

228
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,019
to blend in with your friends,

229
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,939
your own desires
might hinder communication.

230
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:09,486
And that's already ingrained
in your body and brain.

231
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,698
That's why, the moment you feel anger,

232
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,199
or any other emotion…

233
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,744
Whenever an emotion…

234
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,373
wells up inside you
and you have the urge to express it,

235
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,501
you instinctively suppress it.

236
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,005
Lately, I have started to recognize
when an emotion surfaces.

237
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,299
It's your environment.

238
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,760
In other words, society.

239
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:38,807
Society was what made you
give up on expressing anger.

240
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,936
But now, you have started
to interact with society

241
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,150
and the people are making you think
maybe it's okay to get angry.

242
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,985
That's how you're feeling right now.

243
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,240
You have the ability to get angry.

244
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505
Hey, there.

245
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,674
Why are you late?

246
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm asking for a tangible reason.

247
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,766
Like, the train was delayed or something.

248
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,811
Though a three-hour delay seems unlikely.

249
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,980
I need an explanation like that.

250
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,024
Why? You're at home.

251
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,236
Well…

252
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,904
I…

253
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,615
I don't like it when you're late.

254
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,575
I told you that before, right?

255
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,369
Did you have plans later?

256
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,662
No, it's not that.

257
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,790
Waiting here alone

258
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,460
for two, three hours is not fun.

259
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,796
But I can wait.

260
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,339
That's not what I mean.

261
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,759
Maybe you can wait but--

262
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,845
I'm sure you can wait too.

263
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,265
If you don't have any plans,
you can just kill time.

264
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,433
But we had set a time.

265
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:05,894
Look.

266
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,480
I want you to stop being late.

267
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,692
I don't think
we can maintain this relationship

268
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,236
if we keep doing things
each of us doesn't like.

269
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,364
I think so too but--

270
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,657
Then why won't you stop?

271
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,452
I don't think being late is
something we both dislike.

272
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,581
It's not just about being late.

273
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,416
For example…

274
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,004
Going to a café with another guy.

275
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,298
But I haven't done anything wrong.

276
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,301
Even so, it's still unpleasant, isn't it?

277
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,427
Not really.

278
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,263
If you don't do anything wrong,
you can go too.

279
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,932
I don't like being controlled.

280
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,851
What? You think I'm being controlling?

281
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,768
I do.

282
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,770
I mean, I'm fine if you do as you please.

283
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,314
I won't go out with other girls.

284
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,273
Why?

285
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,318
Because you can't prove it
if the other person isn't there.

286
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,986
You can't prove nothing happened.

287
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,696
Look, Hikari.

288
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,074
You went on a photography trip
with another guy and said

289
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,451
there were no romantic--

290
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,577
Because it's true.

291
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,621
But you can't prove that, can you?

292
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,956
So, you don't trust me?

293
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,958
It's not about trust.

294
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,419
Even if we trust each other,

295
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,881
I want us to consider
each other's feelings.

296
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,090
So it is about trust.

297
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,635
No, it's not!

298
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,763
Why is the burden
on the trusting one greater?

299
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,724
Why am I the only one who's suffering?

300
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,853
Don't misuse the word "trust"
for convenience's sake.

301
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,148
Besides, we're in
this relationship together.

302
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,109
You can't just go off doing as you please.

303
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,237
When two or more people gather,

304
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,782
there are more things to consider
than when you're alone!

305
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,675
Getting angry is difficult, isn't it?

306
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,177
I don't know if I got too angry but…

307
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,807
while we were arguing,
I started to lose control.

308
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,518
Maybe I should have been
more used to anger.

309
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,438
I think it's good you broke up.

310
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,485
It's scary if the other person
starts throwing things.

311
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,779
I think I'd be terrified too.

312
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,157
I realized how difficult it is
to control both your mind and body.

313
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,619
Writing it down while listening
must be hard.

314
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,540
I'm just taking notes for now.
I'll transcribe it later.

315
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,951
<i>As instructed,</i>

316
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,289
<i>Kawabata documented his life
and headed towards an orifice.</i>

317
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,651
<i>This story is a compilation

318
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:46,114
<i>of eight individuals from the modern era,
who sought to enter the orifices.</i>

319
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,871
Could you show me
what you wrote when you're done?

320
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,955
Of course.

322
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,592
You wish to get married?

323
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,929
I'm cold. Can I sleep with you?

324
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,890
I didn't expect to meet you
again in this way.

325
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,475
Of course I remember.

326
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,270
My story begins with first love.
