1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:05,755
<i>It is said that sheep were the first
to enter the orifices.</i>

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:12,303
<i>But the first human to enter
is said to be a live streamer.</i>

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,807
<i>The man claimed to be an illustrator,</i>

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>but since he only had work
every six months,</i>

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,812
<i>he wanted to gain recognition.</i>

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:25,567
Today, I am going to explore this orifice
to see what it is and where it leads,

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,402
so I brought all the food I need.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,864
It could get dangerous
if I encounter monsters along the way.

9
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,409
That's why I also packed some garlic
and a cross to fight them off.

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,667
-ISN'T IT DANGEROUS?
-SO EXCITING!

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,211
It's pretty dark in here.
Can you guys see me?

12
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,505
You can? Okay, good.

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,174
The temperature?

14
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,344
It's not exactly cold but it's chilly.

15
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,266
Hold on, I brought a device
to measure the temperature.

16
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,851
And humidity too.

17
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,438
By the way, I haven't sensed
anything unusual so far.

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,398
Huh?

19
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,400
I've been walking straight, haven't I?

20
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,445
I haven't walked that much.
Maybe like three minutes, right?

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,323
What?! No reception?

22
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,567
Here it is.

23
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,529
Oh, this is it…

24
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,698
It's not very detailed, though.

25
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,455
There's a list of those who entered
and those who haven't.

26
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,500
Does it mention why some didn't enter?

27
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,836
Briefly.

28
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,629
Yes, it's vague.

29
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,006
It's very helpful, though.

30
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,258
-Thank you.
-Sure.

31
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,386
It has notes from previous people
and might come in handy.

32
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,437
It's almost like a history book.

33
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,566
Don't you all have this in your rooms?

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,861
My room only had magazines
of barbecue and camping.

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,697
And a scented candle
the previous person left.

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,199
That's nice.
I want to light a scented candle too.

37
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,118
-Do you want me to bring it?
-Tonight.

38
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,244
Okay, tonight.

39
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,830
Who's entering the orifices next?

40
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,165
I'm going on the 21st.

41
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,375
I'm scheduled for the 13th.

42
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,127
-Thirteenth?
-I'm on the 8th.

43
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,465
Anyone else going before that?

44
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,429
Are we going to do this every time?
Let's just write it down.

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,223
Can you write it down, then?

46
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,516
What, me?

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,560
You're the one who suggested it.

48
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,477
I'll do it.

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,687
Thank you.

50
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,113
So, my story begins with first love.

51
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,491
I used to do karate.

52
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,912
I believe I was in third grade
of elementary school.

53
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,580
That's when I started karate.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,541
Now, I've lost all my muscle.

55
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,211
I started because
my father liked martial arts.

56
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,630
He wanted me to try it.

57
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,424
I wasn't really keen on it at first.

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,596
In third grade, I tried out a karate class
and started attending that dojo.

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,892
My classes are tough.
Will you be able to keep up?

60
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,644
Thank you for accepting him.

61
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,729
Can you do it?

62
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,400
Answer me.

63
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,611
Uh-huh.

64
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,198
You also didn't greet
when you entered the dojo.

65
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,534
You have to greet when you enter. Got it?

66
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,453
Okay.

67
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,727
Let me hear your voices.

68
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,979
-<i>Osu</i>!
-<i>Osu</i>!

69
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,355
Fore fist punch stance.

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,691
One.

71
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,484
Two.

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,111
Three.

73
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,738
Four.

74
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,532
Five.

75
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,702
Louder!

76
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,161
-<i>Osu</i>!
-<i>Osu</i>!

77
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,246
Six.

78
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,873
Seven.

79
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,876
Eight.

80
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,463
Raise your voices!

81
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,464
-<i>Osu</i>!
-<i>Osu</i>!

82
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,217
The response is <i>osu</i>.

83
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,513
Don't look at your mother!

84
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,265
Response?

85
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,349
Yes.

86
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,726
It's <i>osu</i>!

87
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,935
<i>O-Osu</i>.

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,146
Nine.

89
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,690
Ten.

90
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,192
Eleven.

91
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,655
That's the kind of dojo I was attending.

92
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,241
Apparently, he doesn't smack
his students anymore.

93
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,618
But he was a very strict sensei.

94
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,873
Every year, this dojo had
a three-day training camp.

95
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,793
We ate meals the sensei cooked,
bathed together at a public bathhouse,

96
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,670
and slept in the training hall.

97
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,672
That kind of training camp.

98
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,760
The first time I attended that camp…

99
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,153
Huh?

100
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,699
I'm cold. Can I sleep with you?

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,201
Oh…

102
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,911
Okay.

103
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,581
The bathroom was freezing.

104
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,249
Oh, yeah?

105
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,378
Did you go?

106
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,005
No, I didn't.

107
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,342
It's super creepy.

108
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,344
Oh, yeah?

109
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,853
I don't want to have my back facing
the bathroom, so can I lean against you?

110
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,896
Okay.

111
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,990
Don't you find it creepy
sleeping near the bathroom?

112
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,036
I don't believe in ghosts at all.

113
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,838
She snuck into my futon
again the next night.

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,382
That's when I started
being attracted to her.

115
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,844
But I was just a kid in elementary school
and didn't know what to do.

116
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,805
Moreover, all students of this dojo
went to different schools,

117
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,640
so I only knew her name.

118
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,393
<i>Thinking back, Sugaya vaguely remembers</i>

119
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:20,189
<i>holding hands for the first time
while sleeping during this camp.</i>

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,902
<i>However, after all these years,
his memory is fuzzy.</i>

121
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,156
Although I couldn't even
ask for her phone number during the camp,

122
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,032
I consider that my first love.

123
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,510
Her name was Ms. Mori.

124
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,265
But since that camp,
I didn't see her at the dojo anymore.

125
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,815
Are karate classes only on Tuesdays?

126
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,986
They also have children's classes
on Wednesdays and Fridays.

127
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,280
Can I switch to another day?

128
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,364
Why?

129
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,532
Because…

130
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,243
On Tuesdays, I also have PE
before my karate lesson,

131
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,703
so it's exhausting.

132
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,747
You also have PE on Fridays.

133
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,624
But it's in the second period.

134
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,504
First, I switched to Fridays,
where I had PE in the second period.

135
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,508
If she didn't come, I would then change
to Wednesdays, where I didn't have PE.

136
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,470
<i>However, even after switching days,
Sugaya did not see her again.</i>

137
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,140
After about a year, I quit karate.

138
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,061
I started playing basketball
and played on my junior high school team.

139
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,563
My first relationship was
in my third year.

140
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,232
We were together for three months.

141
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,442
But I didn't want my friends to find out,

142
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,570
so I broke up with her
before they found out.

143
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,740
I did have my fair share of girlfriends.

144
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,826
I never thought about Ms. Mori again.

145
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,874
<i>Sugaya coincidentally met Mori again
in his second year of university.</i>

146
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,880
<i>It happened while he was running an errand
for his host family in the US.</i>

147
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,592
Is your host family
making you run errands?

148
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,760
How did you know?

149
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,014
My host mother told me
to go buy my own food.

150
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,349
You should tell the school.

151
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,227
It's because I eat a lot
and she doesn't know how much to buy.

152
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,190
There's an all-you-can-eat party
in two days. Do you want to come?

153
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,275
Where at?

154
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,667
-The whiskey's over there.
-Okay.

155
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,108
You want anything?
They only have whiskey, though.

156
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,359
I'll have that, then.

157
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,071
Why do they only have whiskey?

158
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,033
I was told we could have
whatever's in the fridge.

159
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,034
Cool.

160
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,456
First time here?

161
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,833
My friend Masaya invited me.

162
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,044
-I don't know anyone else.
-Studying abroad?

163
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,421
-Yes, I'm staying with a host family.
-Second year?

164
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,840
Am I that obvious?

165
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,426
Starting to crave Japanese friends, huh?

166
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,095
It seems like I don't even need to talk.

167
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,264
One more thing. You're from Tokyo.

168
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,350
You've nailed it.

169
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,684
My turn.

170
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,603
Are you here by yourself?

171
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,396
No, with friends.

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,689
You're bad at this.

173
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,176
I kind of thought
we went to the same school.

174
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,844
You smoke?

175
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,013
I just started.

176
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,313
I used to play sports,
so I didn't like cigarettes.

177
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,023
What kind of sports?

178
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,024
This and that.

179
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,405
I played basketball in junior high school,

180
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,240
and then softball in high school.

181
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,241
I quit, though.

182
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,827
In elementary school, I did karate.

183
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,953
I see.

184
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,913
I used to do karate too.

185
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,958
Full contact? What style?

186
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,794
I did karate until my third year
of junior high.

187
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,838
At Mr. Ushigome's dojo.

188
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,424
Wait, Mr. Ushigome?

189
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,175
The Mr. Ushigome?

190
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,679
He's a famous martial artist,
so you might have heard of him.

191
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,683
I know him all too well.

192
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,018
I asked her if she remembered the camp.

193
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,229
Of course I remember.

194
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,606
I was scared of the bathroom.

195
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,864
Since then, I started talking to Ms. Mori
when we ran into each other at school.

196
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,909
We went out with a few people
and smoked together at the smoking area.

197
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
I quit smoking pretty quickly, though.

198
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,414
Hey.

199
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,916
If you come here so often, why not smoke?

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,877
Nah, I quit already.

201
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,421
You're quick to give up.

202
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,339
I got fed up of smoking.

203
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,179
I'm hoping to find work here in the US.

204
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,973
That's impressive.

205
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,559
Have you found anything yet?

206
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,477
Uh-huh.

207
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,940
I might look for work here too.

208
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,859
Do you know what you want to do?

209
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,486
Hm…

210
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,494
This might be the first time
I let someone into my place.

211
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,039
<i>Sugaya's homestay period
was coming to an end,</i>

212
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>and he was scheduled
to fly back to Japan the next day.</i>

213
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,048
A farewell dinner on Christmas Eve, huh?

214
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,429
What will you do back in Japan?

215
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,182
I'm going to eat a ton of Japanese food.

216
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,267
I totally get that.

217
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,854
No matter how long I live here,
I will always crave Japanese food.

218
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,195
Want some?

219
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,906
No, I'm good.

220
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,535
I got them for you because you're leaving.

221
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,126
Oh?

222
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,004
Huh?

223
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,673
W-What?

224
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,633
Wait…

225
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,386
Is something going on?

226
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,055
You're spinning.

227
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,018
Me?

228
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,145
What?

229
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,188
What's going on?

230
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,902
I'm going to fly. I'm going to fly away.

231
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,948
-The centrifugal force is insane.
-What?

232
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,200
You're not spinning.

233
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,369
It's not spinning

234
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,662
Wait a minute, hey!

235
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,957
-We definitely are spinning.
-No, we're not.

236
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,877
We're not spinning.

237
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,211
Oh my gosh.

238
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,963
Whoa…

239
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,883
We are spinning.

240
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,177
No, we're not spinning.

241
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,304
We're not.

242
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,024
<i>Sugaya returned to Japan
and started working.</i>

243
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,486
<i>The next time he encountered Mori was</i>

244
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,239
<i>eight years later at an airport in Egypt.</i>

245
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,914
I got off the plane
and ran to the bathroom.

246
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,626
I was in such a hurry that
I didn't check the restroom signs.

247
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,046
But while I was in the restroom,
I suddenly felt anxious.

248
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,549
I sat with my feet up so they weren't
visible from under the door.

249
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,469
When I came out and was washing my hands…

250
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,888
O-Oh?

251
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,099
That's a reasonable reaction.

252
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,059
We hadn't met in eight years

253
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,312
and what are the chances
of meeting at an airport in Egypt?

254
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,565
On top of that, I had accidentally entered
the women's restrooms.

255
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
That too but…

256
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,070
Wait, let's get out of here first.

257
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,115
I took her hand,

258
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,576
pulled her out of the restrooms
and realized…

259
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,912
She was wearing a ring.

260
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,958
Ms. Mori was on vacation with her fiancé.

261
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,462
I could see her fiancé waiting for her,
so we didn't talk much.

262
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,966
But we did exchange our phone numbers.

263
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,968
You wish to get married?

264
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,137
I do.

265
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,517
We never contacted each other.

266
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,149
The third encounter was a year later.

267
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,193
She contacted me
that she had moved back to Japan.

268
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,781
I didn't expect to meet you
again in this way.

269
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,783
After all, we didn't stay in touch.

270
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,327
You could've reached out to me.

271
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,454
I did.

272
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,247
Took you long enough.

273
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,708
Well, you didn't reach out either.

274
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,295
Speaking of…

275
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,841
I was wondering
when you'd start working in the US.

276
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,342
Me?

277
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,308
I kept wondering what kind of company
you wanted to work for.

278
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,436
I don't know.

279
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,230
It was more of a joke, really.

280
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,026
That's what I thought.

281
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,708
Where do you live?

282
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,336
In Shimouma.

283
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,089
We're heading in the same direction then.

284
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,558
When we were in the States,
I thought you were hot.

285
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,019
Duh.

286
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,647
Not anymore, though.

287
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,190
D-Duh.

288
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:34,196
My friends were sure you wouldn't
come back and told me not to wait for you.

289
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,491
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that

290
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,910
when I said I wanted
to get a job in the US.

291
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,662
I know.

292
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,831
Um…

293
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,961
It's not that I didn't like you
or didn't have feelings for you.

294
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,004
So, yeah.

295
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,675
I liked you.

296
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,593
I see.

297
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,971
It's just not what "getting a job" meant.

298
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,236
I broke up with my fiancée the other day.

299
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,864
How long were you together?

300
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,992
When we met in Egypt,
I was already engaged to her.

301
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,493
I see.

302
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,789
I got married last month.

303
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,748
Oh?

304
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,418
I see.

305
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,114
I'm getting off here.

306
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,632
-See you.
-Yup.

307
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,434
I kind of felt
I would never see her again.

308
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,607
I think…

309
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,568
it was a lie that she'd gotten married.

310
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,989
I think she'd broken up with her fiancé.

311
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,742
But I'd lied to her too.

312
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,537
I think we both knew we were lying.

313
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,832
I was engaged to my current wife,

314
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,709
and we were living together.

315
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,340
Who did you like more?

316
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,343
That's a harsh question.

317
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,261
Well…

318
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,763
I reached out to Ms. Mori once,
but she didn't reply.

319
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,723
There's your answer.

320
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,933
Your poor wife.

321
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,271
I might lose hope in marriage
if I can't be with my true love.

322
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,065
Don't get me wrong, I love my wife.

323
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,109
From your story,
it's hard to believe that.

324
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,485
No, I mean it.

325
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,321
I don't know, though…

326
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,699
Maybe it's karma.

327
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,201
My wife and I were blessed with a child,

328
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,454
but the doctor told us
our child wouldn't live long.

329
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,332
Well…

330
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,543
Karma doesn't sound right.

331
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:40,507
But it's easier for me to think that way
and punish myself.

332
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,595
Such a tiny human being
is already destined to die.

333
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,306
And what's more, before me.

334
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,851
Yet, all we can do is wait.

335
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,896
I just can't accept the fact
that everyone dies

336
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,982
as anything other than a punishment.

337
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,984
And that's when the orifices appeared.

338
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,571
Oh no.

339
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,450
Did I bring down the mood?

340
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,287
That wasn't my intention, you know?

341
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,052
Seems like those who haven't entered yet
are still in contact with Mr. Ozawa.

342
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,485
<i>The only thing we know about Sugaya is</i>

343
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,947
<i>that he probably
didn't enter the orifices.</i>

344
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,826
<i>There is even no record of him returning.</i>

345
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,748
<i>However, the person who recruited
Sugaya to join the organization</i>

346
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:59,336
<i>told Ozawa that Sugaya's wife
and child were living happily.</i>

347
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,257
<i>Sugaya's whereabouts
remain unknown to everyone.</i>

348
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,841

349
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,928
I reserved tickets for today's show.
My name is Yukie Hara.

350
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,889
A Yukie Hara with the same kanji
came to see the show.

351
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,975
It's hard to cross paths.

352
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,643
Who was I doing all this for?

353
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,978
<i>Seven Orifices.</i>

354
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,813
But the orifices are there for us.
