1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:04,004
<i>An official meeting took place</i>

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:07,590
<i>two days after the appearance
of the orifices.</i>

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>The ministers who attended
the meeting were perplexed,</i>

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,889
<i>and the discussion began with what
should be addressed first at the meeting.</i>

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,475
I wonder who dug those orifices.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,685
Oh, come on.

7
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,396
No one can dig an orifice in midair.

8
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,815
What should we do about them?

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,401
And whose jurisdiction do they fall under?

10
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,612
That must be under your jurisdiction,
the Ministry of Defense.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,366
It's not like we're under attack.
Shouldn't it be yours?

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,325
No.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,287
I've never heard of orifices
spontaneously appearing in midair.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,250
Since they are floating in the air,
shouldn't they be considered culture?

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,419
Is that so?

16
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,173
Yes, they're art, so you should
place them under your jurisdiction.

17
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,091
That is a good idea.

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,843
Is it?

19
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,098
Exactly. It's 100,000 yen per person
for investigating the orifices.

20
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,560
It shouldn't be too hard.
What do you think?

21
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,813
I'm sure we will find
participants in no time.

22
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:11,196
Could you find people who are willing
to investigate for 30,000 yen?

23
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,907
It won't be anything
difficult or dangerous.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,742
Yes, of course.

25
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,830
The government says it's not dangerous,
so it should be fine.

26
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,123
As for remuneration,

27
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,668
each participant will get 15,000 yen
for investigating the orifices.

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,505
Leave it to me. I'll handle it.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,257
We're the only ones you've asked, right?

30
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,430
Can you find some young people
who are willing to work for 5,000 yen?

31
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:18,680
Until recently, I was working
at a music box museum.

32
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,807
What's that?

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,102
It's like an art museum run by the town

34
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,646
but it specializes in music boxes.

35
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,356
There might not be one around here.

36
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,026
The part-timers who were trying to fill up
the orifices eventually entered them.

37
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,404
Where do you live now?

38
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,324
I live here now
but I used to live in the countryside.

39
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,077
A lot of people moved here
since the orifices appeared.

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,371
I didn't move here because of that.

41
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,372
-Oh.
-Well…

42
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,624
I've been moving around a lot.

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,503
I thought it would be nice
to live in a peaceful place,

44
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,088
so I was looking around.

45
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:57,176
Because of that,
I didn't have a fixed job, to be honest.

46
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,054
Amidst all the moving around,

47
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,850
I had come to live here once before.

48
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,978
Let me tell you in chronological order.

49
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,230
I used to work at a library.

50
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,859
It wasn't being used much
and it closed down

51
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:17,989
because they couldn't afford
to keep it open for the few patrons.

52
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,950
After that, I wanted to be bold

53
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,787
and moved here to get
a completely different job.

54
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,292
I'm going to pick up the bento boxes!

55
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:37,091
<i>Matsuoka got a job
at an advertising agency.</i>

56
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,553
At first, I was enthusiastic,

57
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,223
but the work schedule was really brutal.

58
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,475
It was so different from the library.

59
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,312
I hardly had time to sleep,
my motivation declined,

60
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,272
and I was exhausted.

61
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,484
I'm sure this company
would have hired anyone.

62
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,195
No one worked here for long.

63
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:01,032
I mean, who would want to work
for such an exploitative company?

64
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,827
Talented people would
definitely get a different job.

65
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,789
I said that's too much light.
It's way too bright.

66
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,208
And I'm telling you it won't be visible.

67
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,378
-Of course it's visible!
-No, it's not!

68
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,046
Are you for real?

69
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,216
Do it yourself, then.

70
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,010
I thought about stopping them.

71
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,639
But they were big names in the industry
and I was a newbie.

72
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,351
Besides, I didn't want to deal
with angry adult men.

73
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,895
Yet, I had to tell them
the bento boxes were here

74
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,647
or a superior would yell at me.

75
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,024
You can't handle it alone, can you?

76
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,609
That's not the point.

77
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,486
Do you have a problem with me?

78
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,698
I'm just telling you it's too bright,
so turn down the light a notch.

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,574
What part of this is too bright?

80
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,659
Um…

81
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,995
The bento boxes are here.

82
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,457
They are over there.

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,086
Are you okay? What's wrong?

84
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,256
If I don't announce the bento boxes,
I'll get scolded.

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,174
Right.

86
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,051
Did you get yelled at?

87
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,142
We weren't fighting or anything.

88
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,061
It's just our usual playful banter.

89
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,439
I-It's too much.

90
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,649
How should I have known?

91
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,279
He tends to use too much light,
so we were just messing around.

92
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,572
You were yelling.

93
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,074
We weren't fighting, though.

94
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,120
But I thought it was too bright too.

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,664
You mean me?

96
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,207
The lighting.

97
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,751
My lighting?

98
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,963
I was wondering if it might be too bright.

99
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,258
Was it too much?

100
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,887
It was so bright,
I thought about suggesting

101
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,181
to turn down the light a bit.

102
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,891
You?

103
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,810
I thought if the filming crew
was okay with it…

104
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,147
But the light…

105
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,734
The light was…

106
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,779
It was as if the light was burning
the subject to death.

107
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,240
Was it that bad?
Don't you think that's a bit extreme?

108
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,035
You were using that much light.

109
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,954
I thought the actor might catch fire.

110
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,581
Oh, but…

111
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,043
Yeah, it might've been too bright.
I admit I might've overdone it.

112
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,461
Sorry.

113
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,046
It's okay.

114
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,425
<i>Matsuoka decided to quit her job.</i>

115
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,679
Who was I doing all this for?

116
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,683
I couldn't keep going anymore
and wanted to go someplace quiet.

117
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,855
Then, why did you start working
at the music box museum right away?

118
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,361
Because I needed to make a living.

119
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,782
It might have been better
if I had taken some time off.

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,369
The strange thing is…

121
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,955
When you're in a state
where you can't take a break,

122
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,749
the option of taking a break
is not even on the table.

123
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,546
Have you moved out of that house?

124
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,173
Yes, I'm already living here.

125
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,385
Our museum is…

126
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,262
How should I put it…

127
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,348
We only get very few visitors.

128
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,602
It might be a boring place to work at
for someone your age.

129
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,020
That's okay.

130
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,024
Even on busy days,
we only get about five visitors.

131
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,903
During the offseason, it's even less.

132
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,949
There are plenty of other places
that offer better pay.

133
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,953
I'm good at finding something to do.

134
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,175
If a group comes, please guide them
along the route I just showed you.

135
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,846
Although groups only come
once a year tops.

136
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,932
Just be prepared to guide them
in case they do come.

137
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,225
Noted.

138
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,395
And… that's the stage.

139
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,816
You do plays?

140
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,110
Only when we have reservations,

141
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:11,115
we reach out to the city's theater group
and they perform fairy tales.

142
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,287
Mostly, it's part of a school's
extracurricular activity.

143
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,419
<i>One day, when Matsuoka
was working her shift.</i>

144
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,422
<i>There were a total
of six visitors on that day.</i>

145
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,508
We're with the theater group.

146
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,636
-I'll show you--
-It's okay. We know where to go.

147
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,845
Oh, go on in.

148
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,187
<i>Among the six visitors that day,</i>

149
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,065
<i>one had reserved a seat
for the performance.</i>

150
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,735
<i>Although Matsuoka had only
been working here for a few weeks,</i>

151
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,489
<i>this was the first reservation
and she found it unusual.</i>

152
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,533
Excuse me.

153
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,369
I reserved tickets for today's show.
I'm Yukie Hara.

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
Thank you for coming.

155
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,627
Who is it?

156
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,337
It's Little Red Riding Hood.

157
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,716
Oh, Little Red Riding Hood. Come on in.

158
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,262
I'm not feeling well
and can't get out of bed.

159
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,141
Hello, Grandmother.

160
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,063
Your ears are so big, Grandmother.

161
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:11,068
Yes, so I can hear better what you say.

162
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,238
And your eyes are large and shiny.

163
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,781
It's a little scary.

164
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,742
No need to be scared.

165
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,829
It's so I can see you better, my dear.

166
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,499
Your hands are
quite large too, Grandmother.

167
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,794
Have they always been this large?

168
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,088
No need to be afraid.

169
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:36,761
If I didn't have large hands,
I wouldn't be able to hold you in my arms.

170
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,181
<i>On a different day.</i>

171
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,017
<i>Matsuoka came to work</i>

172
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,771
<i>to find the name "Yukie Hara"
on the reservation list.</i>

173
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,314
<i>It hadn't even been a week</i>

174
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,609
<i>since she had attended
the previous performance.</i>

175
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,319
Excuse me.

176
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,740
I reserved tickets for today's show.
I'm Yukie Hara.

177
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:04,038
To be honest, I found the show
was even more boring than commercials.

178
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,873
For a minute, I wondered if

179
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,210
there was nothing better to do here
than watch the same show twice.

180
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,838
But then, I realized it was a coincidence
that they had the same name.

181
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,008
Hello, Grandmother.

182
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,596
Have your ears
always been so big, Grandmother?

183
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,724
<i>Matsuoka was curious about</i>

184
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,602
<i>how this Yukie Hara would watch the show.</i>

185
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,063
<i>Therefore, she watched her from behind.</i>

186
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>As did the other Yukie Hara,</i>

187
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,070
<i>she, too, was simply staring at the stage.</i>

188
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,617
Your hands are
quite large too, Grandmother.

189
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,753
I've been living here for a while but
I didn't know there was a place like this.

190
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,798
Have you seen the museum as well?

191
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,051
Yes, I did.
Although there's not much to see.

192
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,095
It's nice and calm, though.

193
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,057
Do you happen to know
someone by the same name

194
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,268
who lives around here?

195
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,187
She's around the same age as you.

196
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,105
No, I don't.

197
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,607
A little while ago,

198
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,070
a Yukie Hara with the same kanji
reserved and came to see the show.

199
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,739
When I saw the reservation list today,

200
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,534
I thought she had come
to watch it a second time.

201
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,702
Oh, really?

202
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,121
Does she come here often?

203
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,416
I've only started working here recently,

204
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,084
so I'm not sure about that.

205
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,587
Maybe I should come here
from time to time.

206
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,050
Ms. Hara really started
coming here regularly.

207
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,971
She didn't get to meet
the other Yukie Hara.

208
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,142
Instead, she ended up frequently
engaging in conversation with me.

209
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,822
For the past six months,

210
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,618
you've been the only person
who's been watching the play.

211
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,788
It's hard to cross paths.

212
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,753
<i>Matsuoka tried to figure out</i>

213
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:21,342
<i>a way to introduce
Ms. Hara to the other Yukie Hara.</i>

214
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>Recalling her fading memories
of the other Yukie Hara,</i>

215
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,522
<i>Matsuoka started searching the internet.</i>

216
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,488
That's it.

217
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,741
Now, tap here to upload your picture.

218
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,744
Does it have to be a picture of myself?

219
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,539
It can be anything,
like a landscape for example.

220
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,334
Then, I'll use a photo of my dog.

221
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,174
Now, type "Yukie Hara"
into this search bar.

222
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,054
There are a lot of them.

223
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,642
This is the other Yukie Hara.

224
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,353
Well, they're all called Yukie Hara but…

225
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,439
If you tap here, you can send a message.

226
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,399
I see.

227
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,112
Maybe I should use a photo of myself
instead of my dog.

228
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,364
Could you take a photo of me?

229
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,323
Sure.

230
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,329
Okay.

231
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,249
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

232
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,005
What do you think?

233
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,800
The lighting is perfect.

234
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,760
Let's take one at the museum next time.

235
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,722
What should I write?

236
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,725
Is it okay to message her out of the blue?

237
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,101
Yes, of course.

238
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,816
"Hello, I'm Yukie Hara."

239
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,695
I bet she'll be surprised
when she reads this.

240
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,035
<i>The two Yukie Haras
connected through social media.</i>

241
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,621
<i>It turned out that
the other Yukie Hara was</i>

242
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,124
<i>in the arts business
and was working in Germany.</i>

243
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,543
<i>Therefore, she currently wasn't in Japan.</i>

244
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,172
<i>However, they promised to meet up</i>

245
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,508
<i>the next time she returned to Japan.</i>

246
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,429
Six years have passed since then.

247
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,348
I quit my job at the music box museum.

248
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,184
Now I work at this small public bathhouse.

249
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,813
It's modern and provides
a comfortable working environment.

250
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,112
"Ms. Matsuoka, I hope you are doing well."

251
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,907
"I have news."

252
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:55,412
"I have kept in touch with Yukie Hara
and I am going to meet her."

253
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,456
"It's been six years."

254
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,793
"She is finally coming back from Germany."

255
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,421
"It's all thanks to you, Ms. Matsuoka."

256
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,050
"Would you like to join us?"

257
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,348
It's nice to see you again.

258
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,064
Who is it?

259
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,566
It's Little Red Riding Hood.

260
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,361
Oh, Little Red Riding Hood. Come on in.

261
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:14,241
I'm not feeling well
and can't get out of bed.

262
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,911
Hello, Grandmother.

263
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:23,208
Your ears are so big, Grandmother.

264
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:28,505
Yes, so I can hear better what you say.

265
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,925
And your eyes are large and shiny.

266
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,469
It's a little scary.

267
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,512
No need to be scared.

268
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,183
It's so I can see you better, my dear.

269
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,811
Your hands are
quite large too, Grandmother.

270
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,023
Have they always been this large?

271
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,400
No need to be afraid.

272
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:54,364
If I didn't have large hands,
I wouldn't be able to hold you in my arms.

273
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,910
Your mouth is very large too.

274
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,622
Has it always been so large?

275
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,335
Even after six years, it was still boring.

276
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,131
Yet the two of them
simply stared at the stage.

277
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,861
The two Yukie Haras had found

278
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,988
many similarities between each other.

279
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,117
Not only did they have the same name,

280
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,745
but they were the same age
and shared the same birthday.

281
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,041
Even their dogs had the same birthday
and were the same breed.

282
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,336
However, they were born and raised
in different places.

283
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:54,007
The other Yukie Hara had visited
this place just by chance.

284
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,802
Let's meet up here again
next time I come back from Germany.

285
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,055
Yes, let's. I need to stay
healthy until then.

286
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,473
Although that play is boring.

287
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,976
Will they still be performing it?

288
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,354
They've been doing it for six years,
so I'm sure they'll keep it boring.

289
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,606
You should come too, Ms. Matsuoka.

290
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,650
Next time, let's have dinner together.

291
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,568
Yes.

292
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:24,454
Seeing them made me wish
to age gracefully as well.

293
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,957
That's why I came back to this town.

294
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,917
But…

295
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,338
Two years ago,
I was diagnosed with an illness.

296
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,840
So…

297
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,261
Getting sick wasn't what I'd meant
when I said I wanted to age.

298
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,220
Well…

299
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,639
You get them even if
you don't wish for them.

300
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,725
That's what illnesses are.

301
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,451
She's not coming back from Germany
for four years?

302
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,872
What does she do for work?

303
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,667
Something related to the arts.

304
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,629
I'm not very familiar
with the kind of work she does.

305
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,963
I see.

306
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,926
But the orifices are there for us.

307
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,388
Maybe you can meet her in there.

308
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,433
Do they have orifices in Germany too?

309
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,602
In Germany…

310
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,020
there aren't.

311
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,897
Not in Germany.

312
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,814
Oh, okay.

313
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,650
There are no orifices in Germany.

314
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,027
So, if she wants to enter one,

315
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,655
she'll need to come back to Japan.

316
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,283
We don't know
if she wants to enter, though.

317
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,746
She might not enter.

318
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,123
But even if she doesn't enter…

319
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,836
We will meet inside the orifices one day.

320
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,922
I assure you.

321
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,485
Are you allowed to drink alcohol?

322
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,863
That's a good question.

323
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,664
Shoot.

324
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,332
The meat is burning.

325
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,333
-Oh!
-Oh, no.

326
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,127
-I'll eat this, then.
-Really?

327
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,087
Burned food is bad for you.

328
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,131
I don't want to let it go to waste.

329
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,591
I'll take this one.

330
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,386
-Can I use those chopsticks?
-Go ahead.

331
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,929
Thank you.

332
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,742
Hey, Mom.

333
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,954
I've decided to enter the orifices today.

334
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,498
Yeah, today.

335
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,375
Okay.

336
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,170
Thanks, I'll be careful.

337
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,340
Yeah, thanks.

338
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,803
Do you think
there's reception in the orifices?

339
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,930
I'm not sure.

340
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,892
It might be bad, right?

341
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,267

00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,647
I'm thinking of letting her quit.

343
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,316
I was born in the UK.

344
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,236
She still can only speak English
and can't fit in at school.

345
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,695
So she wants to do ballet?

346
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,365
I didn't choose to be born in this body.

347
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,825
It's not my fault.

348
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,992
Objectively?

349
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,370
Maybe someone who wants
to go pro should go.

350
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,914
It's all about talent.
