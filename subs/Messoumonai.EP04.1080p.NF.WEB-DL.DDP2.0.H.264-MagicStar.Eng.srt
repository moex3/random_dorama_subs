1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>A few days after it was decided to treat
the orifices as part of the landscape.</i>

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,383
<i>Kana Omura, who lived
in a nearby apartment,</i>

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:12,220
<i>started observing an orifice every day
and kept a diary.</i>

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,265
<i>This is what she wrote.</i>

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,976
<i>April 16th.</i>

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,355
<i>Since the blockade has been lifted,
people are coming to see the orifice.</i>

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>April 29th.</i>

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,278
<i>Every night, I go to sleep
thinking about entering the orifice.</i>

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>May 8th.</i>

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>The decision to enter the orifices is
now left to the individual.</i>

11
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>Why is it that no one is coming out?</i>

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,580
<i>June 15th.</i>

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>I've been looking
at the orifice every day.</i>

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,376
<i>I somehow feel like I'm already in it.</i>

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>My homeroom teacher is entering
an orifice next week,</i>

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,591
<i>so we are going to throw a farewell party.</i>

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,093
<i>June 27th.</i>

18
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,847
<i>I'm glad my teacher seemed
to have enjoyed the party.</i>

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,725
<i>She is really looking forward
to entering the orifices.</i>

20
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>By the way, a famous actor also went in.</i>

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>Everyone seems so happy going in,
it's making me jealous.</i>

22
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>July 11th.</i>

23
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>I started dreaming about
the orifices every night.</i>

24
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>Inside the orifices…</i>

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>It's dark at first but you can see
a light on the other end.</i>

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,247
<i>Once you reach the other side,
there's nature</i>

27
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,875
<i>and you never feel hungry.</i>

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,046
<i>This is the last entry in her diary.</i>

29
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,240
Why is it that people believe in aliens

30
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,242
but they don't believe in gods?

31
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,327
Same goes for ghosts,

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,288
but what's the reason
they can't believe in gods?

33
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,750
Well, aliens…

34
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,002
they kind of feel tangible, don't they?

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,921
You could grasp them.

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,676
But I guess, to many people,
gods seem intangible.

37
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,387
What about the orifices, then?

38
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,431
The orifices are actually there.

39
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,684
That's why I can believe in them.

40
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,604
But we're talking about
the god of the orifices here.

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,314
Yeah, but…

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,984
the orifices actually exist
here and there.

43
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,068
They're there.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,404
Objectively?

45
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,324
I don't know if it's objective but…

46
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,578
What do you think it's like
on the other side of the orifices?

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,748
I believe there's nothing
and it doesn't lead anywhere.

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,252
To be honest, I don't care
if there's something or not.

49
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,588
We won't know until we enter, right?

50
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,505
Right.

51
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,800
Who's up next?

52
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,093
It's Ms. Aoyama.

53
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,261
Yes, that's me.

54
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,721
Um…

55
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,432
Thank you.

56
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,812
I'm ready.

57
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,148
Okay, so…

58
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,028
I may not look like it
but I was born in the UK.

59
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,154
-Oh, really?
-Wow.

60
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,323
I lived there until
I was about five years old.

61
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:23,369
My parents had started living in the UK
due to my mother's job.

62
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,123
They're both Japanese
but I was born in the UK.

63
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,459
That's why I look like this.

64
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,211
Are you a British citizen, then?

65
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,630
I haven't decided yet.

66
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,510
While we were living there,
my parents only spoke English,

67
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,806
so when we came to Japan,
I couldn't speak Japanese at all.

68
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,727
We moved to Japan right before
I started elementary school.

69
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,440
I was the only one in school
who couldn't communicate with anyone.

70
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,570
My classmates started
asking me why I couldn't speak.

71
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,448
That's why I had no friends.

72
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,951
But there was this one girl,

73
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,746
Ms. Ishida, who walked home
with me every day.

74
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,831
She didn't play with me in class,

75
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,335
which makes sense
because I couldn't speak Japanese.

76
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,838
But we happened to live
in the same direction,

77
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,049
so we started walking home together.

78
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,346
<i>On their way home,
Aoyama and Ishida played a game.</i>

79
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,848
<i>One of them counted up
to a number of their liking</i>

80
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,517
<i>and tagged the other.</i>

81
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,647
<i>The one who was tagged had to continue
counting from that number.</i>

82
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,564
Five.

83
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,858
Five.

84
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,196
Six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,032
Twelve.

86
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,744
Twelve.

87
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,789
Twelve!

88
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,168
Twelve.

89
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,169
Twelve!

90
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,214
Thirteen.

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>However, as they started second grade,
Ishida transferred to another school.</i>

92
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:14,063
<i>Aoyama was alone once again.</i>

93
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,875
Do you want me to teach you that?
The hiragana?

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,170
That's hiragana.

95
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,802
You were close with Ishida, right?

96
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,181
My mom and Ishida's mom are friends
because we're neighbors

97
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,142
and Ishida's my childhood friend,
so she's coming to my place.

98
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,477
You want to come too?

99
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,818
I have a brand-new cotton candy machine
that I got as a present

100
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,572
so we'll play cotton candy shop
and we'll even create our own money.

101
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,672
I grew more and more discouraged.

102
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,176
Maybe it would've been better
if I could have laughed more.

103
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,442
Ms. Iijima.

104
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,658
Oh, Ms. Aoyama. Hello.

105
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,617
Hi there.

106
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,036
H-Hello.

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,621
How have you been?

108
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:58,376
I was surprised to hear you had come back
to Japan with your child.

109
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,504
Moving to different countries
for work can be tiring.

110
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,925
I got fed up of relocating. And elementary
school marks a new chapter, right?

111
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,511
I think it's a good time
to start ballet too.

112
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,518
She still can only speak English
and can't fit in at school.

113
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,562
Could you teach her ballet?

114
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,939
So she wants to do ballet?

115
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,902
No, but I didn't want to leave her
with strangers she can't communicate with.

116
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,239
My English is not very good but…

117
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,148
In the end, I learned to speak Japanese

118
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,692
by the time I graduated
from elementary school.

119
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,238
Does becoming able to speak Japanese
have anything to do with ballet?

120
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,366
No, it doesn't have
much to do with ballet.

121
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,288
Ultimately, I couldn't make friends
with anyone at school or in ballet class.

122
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,920
-Hey, Aoyama.
-Hm?

123
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,047
Let's go to the mall. Do you have ballet?

124
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,133
Okay, but I'm going to have
to leave early because I have ballet.

125
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,011
Cool. Let's ask Nagase as well.

126
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,929
Okay.

127
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,851
I took the entrance exam for a prestigious
junior high school and got in.

128
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,355
Once I could speak,
I started interacting with more people.

129
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,109
Still, I didn't have
any friends like Ms. Ishida.

130
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,653
I continued taking ballet lessons.

131
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,448
If anything, I grew to like ballet
more than when I first started.

132
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,409
And one,

133
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,746
and two, and three, and four, and five,

134
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,624
plié, arabesque, cross.

135
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:49,171
And one, and two,
and three, and four, and five,

136
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,300
plié, forward, cross.

137
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,259
Good.

138
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,052
Mr. Miura, do an arabesque for me.

139
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,222
Keep your hips aligned.

140
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,851
Straighten it up here
and point your toes to here.

141
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,428
Hey, I have two tickets for a show but
I can't go that day. You want them?

142
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,596
What show?

143
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
A ballet company coming from Germany.

144
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,642
I have to attend a memorial service.

145
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,518
How much are they?

146
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,312
13,000 yen each.

147
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,238
That company doesn't come to Japan often,
so it'll be a great learning experience.

148
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,325
The tickets are hard to get
because the lottery odds are high.

149
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:04,747
If it's such a great company,
aren't there other people who want to go?

150
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,000
There are,
so it's first come, first served.

151
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,087
Maybe someone who wants
to go pro should go.

152
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,758
But I want to see that show too.

153
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,637
You once said you wanted to quit
because practice was tough.

154
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,808
Since you have high school entrance exams
coming up, now's a good time to quit.

155
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,268
I don't want to quit anymore, though.

156
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,564
I'm going to ask Ms. Iijima when would be
a good time to quit, so think about it.

157
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,612
Right around that time,
I heard that my elementary school friend

158
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,407
Ms. Ishida was moving
into the neighborhood.

159
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,785
Ms. Ishida and I had both
just gotten smartphones,

160
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,997
and collecting contact information from
elementary school classmates was a thing.

161
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,952
My mom might make me quit ballet.

162
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,622
Convince her that ballet
won't interfere with your studies.

163
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,835
If I hadn't brought up the tickets,
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

164
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,962
But you don't want to quit, right?

165
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,132
I mean, I don't know
if I can become a pro or anything.

166
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,010
Everyone else is amazing
but I'm not particularly outstanding.

167
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
I do want to dance, though.

168
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,433
It's not ballet but my parents
are still letting me dance.

169
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,478
Though it won't help
with the entrance exams…

170
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,443
Remember that counting game
we used to play?

171
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,528
The one we played on our way home.

172
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,280
I wonder what was so fun about it.

173
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,615
What game?

174
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,325
We counted and tagged each other.

175
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,868
Oh…

176
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,997
Sorry, I don't remember. Did we play that?

177
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,666
Oh, really? We used to play it a lot.

178
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,338
I don't remember it at all.
Did we even walk home together?

179
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,840
You don't remember?

180
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Not really…

181
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,138
I only remember you as the kid
who couldn't speak Japanese.

182
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,891
Well, it was in first grade after all.

183
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,435
But hey, your Japanese got really good.

184
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,020
Right?

185
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,273
Yeah…

186
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,035
Yes, so I'm thinking of making her quit.

187
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,412
I think now's the time.

188
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>Aoyama was debating
whether to indicate that she could hear</i>

189
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>what her mother was saying on the phone.</i>

190
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,923
I mean, a lot of the kids
have long limbs and slender physiques

191
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,092
that are more suited for ballet.

192
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,346
I regret not letting her do another sport
that's more suited for her.

193
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,309
I hoped she could make friends through
a sport where she didn't have to speak.

194
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,855
Let's go out for a meal
again sometime, Ms. Iijima.

195
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,068
I want to thank you
for looking after her until now.

196
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,281
I didn't choose to be born
in this body and,

197
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,492
as for friends, it's not my fault
I couldn't communicate.

198
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,455
That's what I wanted to tell her.

199
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,752
But…

200
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,339
I also knew…

201
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,844
I couldn't become a pro.

202
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,558
I repeated my mother's words
to Ms. Iijima.

203
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,856
Although the reason I had to quit ballet
wasn't of my own making.

204
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,028
Everyone else started when they were
about three but I started late.

205
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,782
They're all tall and have long limbs.

206
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,787
Everyone moves so gracefully
and are much more talented than me.

207
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,667
I have to start going to cram school.

208
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,211
If I spend more time studying,

209
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,799
I'll fall further behind everyone else
and will become a burden to you, so…

210
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,510
I want to quit.

211
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,727
Is the decision to quit
truly coming from you?

212
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,274
I'm not talented.

213
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,362
But you've improved at things
you couldn't do before.

214
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,324
Becoming able to do something
you couldn't before is amazing.

215
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,160
It's a waste of time for me
to continue with ballet.

216
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,413
I haven't had talent
since I was born in this body.

217
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,501
If you truly want to continue ballet,
I will support--

218
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,337
It's pointless for me to continue,
so don't bother.

219
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,505
I…

220
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,094
I didn't start ballet on my own will.
I only did it because my mom told me to.

221
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,098
And because I didn't have
friends at school.

222
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,143
I was only listening
to what my mom told me

223
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,771
because I didn't have
anyone else to talk to.

224
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,527
But, to be honest…

225
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,367
I wanted to continue a little longer.

226
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,002
You can go to cram school
and come to my studio.

227
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,631
Just tell your mother
you're going to study and come here.

228
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:55,723
<i>Aoyama washed her leotard at the studio
and left her equipment there too.</i>

229
00:16:55,806 --> 00:17:00,436
<i>She covered her tuition
by helping out in the studio.</i>

230
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,315
<i>However, since it didn't amount
the full tuition fee,</i>

231
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,403
<i>it was largely thanks
to Iijima's kindness.</i>

232
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>Aoyama told her mother
she was going to study at the library</i>

233
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,617
<i>and continued taking ballet lessons.</i>

234
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,044
And one.

235
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,129
Extend your arm to the side.

236
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,883
Arabesque.

237
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,551
Keep your back straight.

238
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,312
<i>Aoyama's mock exam results were good
and she was deemed likely</i>

239
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,106
<i>to gain admission
to her preferred schools.</i>

240
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,111
<i>Most of the high schools she was going
to apply to were picked by her mother</i>

241
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:56,075
<i>but the list also contained
some schools Aoyama herself liked.</i>

242
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,173
Ms. Aoyama.

243
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:19,807
I'm hoping you'll take on a role
in the next recital.

244
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,850
It's Columbine.

245
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,898
I'd love to.

246
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,399
Great!

247
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,984
Also…

248
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:35,322
I think it might be good
if you told your mother about this.

249
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,870
I don't know if you plan on continuing
ballet once you're in high school,

250
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,832
but I think it would be good for her
to see you perform.

251
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,002
I'll apologize to her, too,
for having kept this a secret.

252
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,506
I'll try inviting her.

253
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,893
Mom, can we talk?

254
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
What is it?

255
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,566
Um…

256
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,943
Is it bad news?

257
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,320
No, it's not that.

258
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,655
Then tell me.

259
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,367
So, I was going to cram school, right?

260
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,247
And I was studying with friends
at the library. Well, I still am.

261
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,583
I also got good results on the mock exam.

262
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,962
That's because I studied a lot
and I'm glad I did.

263
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,008
I think I can get into
my first-choice high school.

264
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,803
So, the thing is…

265
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,893
When I said I was going
to the library, I was lying.

266
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,478
What do you mean?

267
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,355
At times, I really went to the library.

268
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,982
But most of the time…

269
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,027
I was taking ballet lessons.

270
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,198
On the day I went to tell
Ms. Iijima I was quitting,

271
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,327
she said if I helped out at the studio,
she would let me take lessons for free.

272
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,623
I kept all of my equipment at the studio
and washed my things there too.

273
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,711
So, there were days where…

274
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,965
I pretended to go to the library
and took ballet lessons.

275
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,054
And…

276
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,097
So…

277
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,599
Um…

278
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,312
I don't plan on continuing ballet
in high school.

279
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,605
Although I do love ballet.

280
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,525
Ms. Iijima and I were talking
about taking it easy, you know?

281
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,028
And…

282
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,074
My last recital is coming up.

283
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,453
Ms. Iijima offered me a role,
and it's a proper role.

284
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,500
It's my first big recital,
so I was hoping you'd come.

285
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,128
It would be great if you came to see it.

286
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,548
What do you…

287
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,801
…think?

288
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,808
How dare you meddle
in other people's educational choices?

289
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,686
You've not just been meddling
but also interfering.

290
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,772
I can't believe you've been
deceiving me all this time.

291
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,316
Working together with a child
to deceive her parents?

292
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,568
Are you going to adopt her, or what?

293
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,029
I'm not going to let her
participate in the recital.

294
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,117
Children this age aren't allowed to work,
and it's not just about paying her or not.

295
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,368
It's just wrong.

296
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,954
Making her work in exchange
for lessons? Seriously?

297
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,873
She was struggling and
you made her believe I'm a toxic parent.

298
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,460
What are you going to do about
our parent-child relationship now, huh?

299
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,547
Or did you think I couldn't afford
the tuition? How much is it?

300
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,631
I'll wire it to you.

301
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,302
Although it's money I shouldn't have
to pay since I thought I'd made her quit.

302
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,429
But I'll pay you that money.

303
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,724
Please accept this dirty money and
continue teaching ballet.

304
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,767
Now, please give me your banking details.

305
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,607
This goes for everything
but it's all about talent, right?

306
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,031
In the end, I couldn't
participate in the recital.

307
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,868
I haven't danced since getting
into high school, and now…

308
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,289
The only feeling I have left is
that I wanted to dance.

309
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,645
<i>Aoyama's mother had
