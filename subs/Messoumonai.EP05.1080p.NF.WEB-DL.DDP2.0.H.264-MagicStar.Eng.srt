1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,839
<i>In May 1972,
at an amusement park in Hokkaido.</i>

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:10,969
<i>Rumors circulated about young women
disappearing one after another.</i>

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,638
<i>The rumor was that they were drugged</i>

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,392
<i>and abducted
when they went to the restroom.</i>

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,894
He's an abductor!

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,855
Kidnapper!

7
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:26,651
<i>However, no such incidents
had actually occurred.</i>

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>Yet, in late May,</i>

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,658
<i>the owner found himself surrounded
by the public, on the verge of a riot.</i>

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,787
<i>Even though there were reports
denying the rumors,</i>

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,331
<i>the situation didn't settle down.</i>

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,335
As with the amusement park incident,

13
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:50,800
rumors spread and don't die down
even if they are known not to be true.

14
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>Around the time the orifices appeared,</i>

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,266
<i>there was an increase in people
visiting hospitals due to asthma.</i>

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>Even after it became clear that
the orifices weren't the cause,</i>

17
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,815
<i>many still kept blaming the orifices.</i>

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:13,156
People like to spread captivating lies
even after the truth is revealed.

19
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,701
Please do your part
in spreading the real facts.

20
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,732
Are there any warm drinks?

21
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,361
Wine can be warmed up, right?

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,278
Right.

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,365
I brought some camping gear,
so I'll go get them.

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,867
Did we run out of wine?

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,327
No, we still have some.

26
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,621
Um…

27
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,916
We all can see the orifices,

28
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,419
but what if we're all just imagining them
at the same time?

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,422
Do you mean, what if they don't exist?

30
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,466
But we all believe they're there.

31
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,763
You mean, if everyone believes
they're there, everyone can see them?

32
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,516
If so, where are the people who entered?

33
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,601
I don't know about that.

34
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,272
Who wants some hot wine?

35
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,816
I'd like some too.

36
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:36,072
Should we warm up the whole bottle or
should we pour it in here and heat it up?

37
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,532
Oh, I'll do it.

38
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,909
You're up next, Mr. Watanabe.

39
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,327
Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,209
This story is a bit embarrassing for me
to tell, especially in front of women.

41
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,503
I felt embarrassed too.

42
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,671
Your story was fine.

43
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,928
I have a sister
who's a year older than me.

44
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,266
Our parents divorced when we were young.

45
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,603
We both went to live with our mother,

46
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,731
and so we played together a lot.

47
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,820
When we were in junior high school,
our father passed away

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,074
and our mother had to pay off his debts.

49
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,787
That's why my sister took on a part-time
job when she started high school.

50
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,748
And she got busy.

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,208
Anyway,

52
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,961
we were both able to go to university.

53
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:38,176
My sister started working after graduation
but I didn't get a job.

54
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,179
I wanted to take the judicial exam.

55
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:46,184
I've been studying meticulously
and taking the exams until recently.

56
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,353
How old are you now?

57
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,855
I'm 54. Yeah…

58
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,857
And…

59
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,277
I even didn't get a part-time job.

60
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,491
I was relying on my mother
to send me money and focused on studying.

61
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,460
Hello.

62
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,296
Have you taken on a part-time job?

63
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,131
Um, no…

64
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,636
Well, you know, studying is
harder than I thought.

65
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,971
Listen.

66
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,848
Shouldn’t you give up
on the judicial exam?

67
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,684
How old are you?

68
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,603
Well…

69
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,522
How old am I again?

70
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,525
Mom doesn't have the money
to support you anymore.

71
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,778
I want this to be the last time.

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,324
It's going to be my 12th attempt anyway.

73
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,495
Either way, I want this to be
the last time she sends you money.

74
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,916
But…

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,504
Even if I pass the exam,
it'll still take time until I find a job.

76
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,717
I will still be needing money
during that time.

77
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,803
I wonder what I should do then.

78
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,182
If you pass, I'll lend you a little money.

79
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,393
A loan…

80
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,187
What does Mom say about this?

81
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,315
What I just told you.

82
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:21,487
<i>For Watanabe, being cut off meant
the end of his life.</i>

83
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,198
<i>Of course,</i>

84
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:29,120
<i>he did think about what would happen
when his mother grew old and passed away.</i>

85
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>But it was something he'd rather not
think about, even more so than the exams.</i>

86
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,359
What should I do then?

87
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,779
Should I just end my life here?

88
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,033
No, I just need 100,000 yen.

89
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,827
It's half of what Mom used to send me.

90
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,663
You have a stable job, don't you?

91
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,460
It's only until I find a part-time job.

92
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,800
What should I become
if I can't find a part-time job?

93
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,969
So you do mean I should end my life.

94
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,560
In the end, my sister
didn't lend me money.

95
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,231
But she introduced me to an acquaintance
who owned a movie theater.

96
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,737
Enjoy.

97
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,451
Enjoy.

98
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,217
Enjoy.

99
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:14,851
They paid 500 yen for a drink that costs
100 yen at the convenience store.

100
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,019
They bought two of those 500-yen drinks.

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,148
They were probably
20 years younger than me.

102
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,653
With my hourly wage of 920 yen,
I would have to work two hours.

103
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,659
This guy will buy two colas and
a premium popcorn.

104
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:36,122
Can I get two colas and
a premium popcorn? The caramel one.

105
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,126
I can't afford this kind of lifestyle.

106
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,548
If I had an income appropriate for my age,
I could afford to eat and drink here too.

107
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,259
Excuse me, the movie's starting soon,
so could you hurry?

108
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,218
I'll be quick.

109
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,265
I didn't want to breathe the same air
as those who couldn't even plan

110
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,934
their shopping time
before coming to the cinema.

111
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,757
Oof.

112
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,743
Can I talk to you?

113
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,132
So, lately…

114
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,387
On the days you're working here,

115
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,390
the number of ice creams
somehow doesn't add up.

116
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,976
-What?
-No.

117
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,936
Don't play dumb.

118
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,813
I mean,

119
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,732
I appreciate you working almost every day.

120
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,943
But I found it strange,

121
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,446
so I checked the surveillance cameras
from the past days.

122
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,282
Do you have anything to say?

123
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,996
Um, I'm not sure what to say.

124
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,125
If you don't know what to say, it's okay.

125
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,626
Just wait here.

126
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,597
What are you going to do?

127
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,599
About what?

128
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,893
If I die and I'm not around anymore,
what will you do?

129
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,563
No one will help you.

130
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,485
I need you to die before that.

131
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,614
Before I die.

132
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>Watanabe's next part-time job was
at a wedding hall.</i>

133
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,293
<i>However, this didn't last long either.</i>

134
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>Watanabe delved into quicker ways
to turn his life around.</i>

135
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,388
<i>The most talked-about place now is Dubai.</i>

136
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,267
<i>With the right methods and strategies,
even monkeys can become successful.</i>

137
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,895
I'm not into information products.

138
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,023
But many live in places
like Thailand and Dubai,

139
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,276
and I think just meeting
and talking to them would be insightful.

140
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,278
<i>Will those people meet with you?</i>

141
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,159
I don't think there's anyone else with
such initiative to come and meet them.

142
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,578
<i>You don't need to do that.</i>

143
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>Just by changing your goal from
the judicial exam, you've changed a lot.</i>

144
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,584
It's not about that.

145
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,629
I want to change my perspective on life.

146
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,506
What do you think?

147
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,718
<i>Just to be sure. You're not asking me
for money, are you?</i>

148
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,431
Of course not. I'll go by myself.

149
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,765
Please exchange this for Thai currency.

150
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,984
Oh, here.

151
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,783
To Narita Airport, please.

152
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,913
I overslept on the day of my flight.

153
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,459
I actually didn't want to pay for a taxi.

154
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,211
Money's tight for me this month,

155
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,589
so I'm grateful for
this drive to Narita Airport.

156
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,007
No problem.

157
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,970
I considered that paying this person
may have been a good thing.

158
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:48,642
In the end, the only thing I'm good for is
borrowing money and spending it on others.

159
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,749
<i>Watanabe was disheartened but searched
for tickets he could buy on the spot.</i>

160
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,250
I don't mind the destination,

161
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:17,004
but are there any tickets still available
for a flight to Asia?

162
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:36,607
<i>Watanabe came to meet
famous influencers living in Dubai.</i>

163
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,818
<i>However, he did not know
any of them personally,</i>

164
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,154
<i>nor did he have their contact information.</i>

165
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,201
<i>What drove Watanabe was a mentality
similar to that of gambling.</i>

166
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:54,083
<i>Naturally, they didn't conveniently appear
in the places he had seen on social media,</i>

167
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,043
<i>and time passed by.</i>

168
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,992
No negotiation here.

169
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,243
Hotel first.

170
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,495
You speak Japanese?

171
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,913
Half Asian.

172
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,540
Let's go. Which way?

173
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,251
But I need to know the price first.

174
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,460
1,000 dirhams.

175
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,045
Okay.

176
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,929
I do have money, you know?

177
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,390
Just give me a minute.

178
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,531
Right…

179
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,909
This is bad.

180
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,077
Seriously bad.

181
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,790
I was actually planning
on going to Thailand today.

182
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,795
So I exchanged yen
for baht and not dirhams.

183
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,297
I thought…

184
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,592
it would be fine
since I have a credit card.

185
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,428
That's why I don't have dirhams on me.

186
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,432
I have money
and I am definitely going to pay you.

187
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,810
The banks are closed now, right?

188
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,729
Ugh…

189
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,649
I could pay you in baht but…

190
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,192
No, that's not…

191
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,568
I know.

192
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,986
Um…

193
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,196
you know what?

194
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,866
Let me calculate how much
this would be in dirhams.

195
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,035
So…

196
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,162
Let's see…

197
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,458
Oh, wrong number.

198
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,627
Um…

199
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,379
One second.

200
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,215
-No need to rush.
-Hm.

201
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,343
Okay, yeah…

202
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,304
I have 1,000 dirhams. No problem at all.

203
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,181
Here.

204
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,689
How about I pay you in baht?

205
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,068
Those are genuine baht bills.

206
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,032
I can give you more than
1,000 dirhams' worth if you want.

207
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,788
I can't make out
if they're really genuine,

208
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,542
so I'll stay here
until you can exchange it.

209
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:48,966
<i>In fact, this incident brought
Watanabe and Rina closer.</i>

210
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,763
<i>Rina became the first friend
Watanabe made as an adult.</i>

211
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,266
<i>But that's a story for another time.</i>

212
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,986
Have you ever been to Japan?

213
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,322
It's the opposite.

214
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,700
What do you mean?

215
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
Actually,

216
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,372
I lied about being mixed.

217
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,960
Well, it happens.

218
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,049
I came here to work
because I can make more money.

219
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,259
By standing?

220
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:38,515
There used to be a middleman
who would refer clients to me.

221
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,478
I made good money the first time I came,
and this is my second time.

222
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,731
But apparently, it wasn't allowed

223
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,108
and the middleman got caught.

224
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,280
I didn't want to go home
without earning anything.

225
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,575
I didn't want to end up
losing money on the flight.

226
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,038
Did you come alone?

227
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,207
Yeah, well…

228
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,751
I'm not here on vacation.

229
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,668
-Oh?
-Yeah.

230
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm here to learn something, even though
I haven't done anything productive yet.

231
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,008
What do you want to learn?

232
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,220
Well…

233
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,514
About life.

234
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,516
Values.

235
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,144
Standards.
I want to figure out stuff like that.

236
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,312
I see.

237
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,481
What do you do for a living?

238
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,983
Nothing.

239
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:36,740
I actually wanted to get into law
to help people, you know?

240
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,658
Uh-huh.

241
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,245
But I failed the judicial exam every time.

242
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,871
So I gave up recently.

243
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,750
I wanted to get a job but at my age…

244
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,629
So I worked some part-time jobs.

245
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,384
I wanted to live an age-appropriate life

246
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,636
and thought I'd try out different things.

247
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,346
Right.

248
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,723
Did you learn anything today?

249
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,184
No, today I didn't learn anything.

250
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,397
The people I saw on social media
aren't anywhere to be found.

251
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,816
Have you met any of them in Dubai?

252
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,733
No, I haven't.

253
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,943
I see.

254
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,155
How about getting a regular job?

255
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,823
It's not possible.

256
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,576
At my age, I can't start over anymore.

257
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,785
But--

258
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,871
I'm even belittled at my part-time jobs.

259
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,585
Be it getting qualifications or
going out for fun, everything costs money.

260
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,212
-But--
-I can't get a regular life anymore.

261
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,130
But--

262
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,631
No "buts."

263
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,842
It's just impossible for me.

264
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,554
What others are allowed to do,
I'm not anymore.

265
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,143
It's enough for me if I can watch
one movie a month.

266
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,815
It's enough if I can go out
for drinks with friends twice a month.

267
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,779
With the jobs I can still get, I can't
afford to treat my sister to a meal

268
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,283
or to take my mother
on a trip for Mother's Day.

269
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,369
I can't start over anymore.

270
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,082
Had I known life doesn't allow do-overs,

271
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,461
I wouldn't have bothered taking the exams.

272
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,675
I hope you find a job soon.

273
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,207
It's double my price.

274
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,335
I don't need it anymore, so take it.

275
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,836
Okay,

276
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,548
when I'm back in Japan, I'll treat
you to a meal. Just once, though.

277
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,301
Go enjoy some good food in Dubai.

278
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,053
Where in Tokyo do you live?

279
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,222
In Iogi.

280
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:11,186
I'm planning to tell my sister
that I'm going to enter the orifices.

281
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,607
Your story isn't embarrassing at all.

282
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,942
Of course it is.

283
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,151
Not at all.

284
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,029
Did you go have a meal
with that person in Japan?

285
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,155
Ah, yes.

286
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,866
We met a few times.

287
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,161
I hadn't expected
to become friends with her.

288
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:32,165
It's easier to make friends when
you're abroad, right? I totally get you.

289
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,751
I don't know her real name, though.

290
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,422
-Could you pass me the wine?
-Sure.

291
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,176
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

292
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,432
I've never stolen anything.

293
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,600
Don't do it.

294
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,228
Although the ice cream was delicious.

295
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:07,659
<i>Watanabe hadn't met his sister since
he informed her about going to Dubai.</i>

296
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,995
Oh, I see.

297
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,540
I'm actually on my way right now.

298
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,585
What?

299
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,171
No.

300
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,092
Yeah, but…

301
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,139
Well…

302
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,308
It's not urgent,

303
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,186
so I could turn around and come meet you.

304
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,064
But…

305
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,447
Well, yeah,

306
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,326
I don't have to enter the orifices today.

307
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,330
<i>On that day, Watanabe went to see
his sister and his mother.</i>

308
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,251
<i>Watanabe lamented that his life was one
where he couldn't obtain what he desired.</i>

309

Your hotel in Oita was quite the buzz.
