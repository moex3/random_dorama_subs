1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,630
<i>It started with the social media account
of a man who claimed</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,841
<i>to have returned from the orifices.</i>

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>The orifices lead
to 200 years in the future.</i>

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,763
<i>And it's not on Earth.</i>

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>The orifices led to a planet
overflowing with brightness.</i>

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>I don't think the brightness was
perceived through my eyes,</i>

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,190
<i>but rather through my five senses,</i>

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>since I could even see it
with my eyes closed.</i>

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,863
<i>The brightness had a natural effect
of making people happy.</i>

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:34,159
<i>The place where people gather is
different from a town but is beautiful.</i>

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>By the way,</i>

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,622
<i>many people are already
in this light-filled place.</i>

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>And there is no cell service
that connects to Earth.</i>

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:50,425
<i>The word "return" gave rise
to a lot of unfounded speculation.</i>

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>Many other accounts appeared,
which tried to enhance credibility</i>

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,853
<i>by posting descriptions of photos claimed
to have been taken in the orifices.</i>

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>However, it took less than a month
for this man's lie to be exposed.</i>

18
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>Not a single person has yet
returned from the orifices.</i>

19
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>After having recorded
the stories of five people,</i>

20
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,727
<i>Okamoto remembered something.</i>

21
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,063
<i>His relationship with his grandmother.</i>

22
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:49,359
<i>He was wondering which part of his life
would be appropriate to record</i>

23
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>for a life leading to the orifices.</i>

24
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,408
<i>Through the personal histories
of the first five people,</i>

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,537
<i>Okamoto's deeply rooted worry</i>

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,290
<i>had grown large enough
for him to clearly recognize it.</i>

27
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:10,547
<i>This worry would eventually
influence his final decision…</i>

28
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,174
<i>but that comes later in the story.</i>

29
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:22,350
<i>At this time, Sugaya was pondering on
the option of not entering the orifices.</i>

30
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:28,356
<i>Upon thinking about the order of entry,
he had realized something.</i>

31
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:33,528
<i>If they followed their set schedules,
Kawabata would go in first.</i>

32
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>Sugaya would be second.</i>

33
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:42,787
<i>He was afraid of being the only one
in this group not to enter the orifices.</i>

34
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:48,877
<i>In the absolute freedom where they could
decide if they wanted to enter or not,</i>

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,381
<i>Sugaya was binding himself
with his own self-consciousness.</i>

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,093
Who's next?

37
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,971
Oh, me.

38
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,064
Actually, when I was in
my fifth year of elementary school,

39
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,444
I was being ignored by my classmates
for a short period of time.

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,740
It all started with a classmate of mine
who played soccer.

41
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,700
His name was Takayuki.

42
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,246
I joined the same
soccer club as him later on

43
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,750
and apparently, he didn't like that.

44
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,963
<i>Kawabata saw a certain similarity
between himself and Shingo.</i>

45
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,217
<i>It was their positions in sports.</i>

46
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>Like Shingo, Kawabata had also
struggled with jealousy.</i>

47
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,851
<i>He had to deal with
a good amount of unfairness,</i>

48
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,020
<i>yet he had never gotten angry.</i>

49
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:54,567
<i>However, he would later come to realize
that he was the exact opposite of Shingo.</i>

50
00:03:55,985 --> 00:04:00,198
Before I started playing soccer,
I was a quiet kid at school.

51
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,284
But after I began playing soccer,

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,997
I gradually started joining
in conversations in class.

53
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,127
Takayuki often said,
"You used to be the quiet kid."

54
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,088
Let's go to the schoolyard.

55
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,256
Okay. Dodgeball?

56
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,258
Let's play against Class 2.

57
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,217
With the soft ball?

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,679
The hard ball isn't good for curveballs,
so I'll go inflate the soft ball.

59
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,556
-Let's go!
-Yay!

60
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,651
Shingo. Soccer quiz time.

61
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,819
Uh, okay.

62
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,529
What's an early cross?

63
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,742
You don't know?

64
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,163
No way! Have you been pretending
to know soccer?

65
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,750
Hey guys, he's a pretender! Unbelievable!

66
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,837
You're a pretender who's playing soccer.
Gross.

67
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,632
By the way, I was better
at soccer than he was.

68
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,970
You're so gross.
Don't act so cocky, you pretender!

69
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,016
<i>Since then, Takayuki kept telling
the other classmates</i>

70
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,769
<i>to ignore Shingo because
he was pretending to know things.</i>

71
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,732
<i>At first, none of the classmates
listened to Takayuki.</i>

72
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,984
<i>But due to his persistent
ignoring of Shingo,</i>

73
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,070
<i>the classmates gradually
started to follow suit.</i>

74
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,449
At first, they weren't
completely ignoring me.

75
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,783
Morning.

76
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,118
Oh, uh-huh.

77
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,418
I started realizing that
they were avoiding me

78
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,837
but I kept talking to them as usual.

79
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,339
Let's go to the traffic park.

80
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,632
-Yes!
-Yay!

81
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,518
Hey, Akira.
You're friends with Mocchi, right?

82
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,813
<i>One day, Shingo decided to talk to Akira,</i>

83
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,108
<i>a quiet student
who was good at basketball.</i>

84
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,112
<i>Until then, he hadn't
talked much with Akira.</i>

85
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,241
We play cards together.

86
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,368
What game do you play?

87
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,079
A card game I came up with.

88
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,790
Wow, I'd like to try that too.

89
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,709
You have to start
by making your own cards.

90
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,170
But because you could
make cards that are too strong,

91
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,922
you can't make them alone.

92
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,633
You have to make them with me and Mocchi.

93
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,051
What kind of game is it?

94
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,427
I have a rulebook.

95
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,891
Ghost Bug Bird. Radiance of the Phoenix.

96
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,226
-Attack point 1,000!
-Hit 3,000 to all!

97
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,143
Guard with Shadow.

98
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,813
Megalo Monster. Illusion. 900.

99
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,439
Electric Attack with Electric Current.

100
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,857
Three thousand!

101
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,192
Cursed Mask. Guard again.

102
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,110
Here I go.

103
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,737
Devil's Hand. Attack 2,200!

104
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,696
Ugh.

105
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,658
Why don't you get along with Takayuki?

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,202
I didn't have a problem with him.

107
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,205
But in our soccer club,
he gets scolded and I don't.

108
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,415
Actually, he's the quiet one on our team.

109
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,918
In my opinion, he's a pretender too.

110
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,254
I'm not pretending to know stuff.

111
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,756
Rock Arm. Attack…

112
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,258
-Whoa!
-Twelve hundred!

113
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,637
<i>About four months after Shingo
and Akira started hanging out together,</i>

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,060
<i>the other classmates who had been ignoring
Shingo started talking to him again.</i>

115
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,439
We want to play cards with you two too.

116
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,112
<i>Shingo accepted this.</i>

117
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:35,204
<i>As for Takayuki,
he had stopped coming to school.</i>

118
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,083
I heard this from my parents,
so I don't know the whole story,

119
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,712
but apparently Takayuki and his parents
had to run from debt collectors.

120
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,466
That's why he transferred schools
without goodbyes.

121
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:51,137
To be honest,
when I found out about this, I felt…

122
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,514
Happy's not the right word…

123
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,184
Well, I guess I was kind of happy.

124
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,561
But I thought I shouldn't say it out loud.

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,985
<i>After graduating from university, Shingo
traveled around Japan and other countries,</i>

126
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,030
<i>searching for ways
to make money on his own.</i>

127
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,492
Actually, I got a job
after graduating from university

128
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,286
but it got boring after three years.

129
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,123
I probably didn't have to travel
around the world

130
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,084
but everyone on social media
seemed to be traveling.

131
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,673
<i>Shingo had started to think
working with others at a company</i>

132
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,969
<i>and living amid others' jealousy wasn't
suitable for him.</i>

133
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,857
I tried my hand at various things.

134
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,860
Like programming and things
I could start my own business with.

135
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,781
I did come up with new services
and created apps

136
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,574
but none of them caught on.

137
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,911
Seeing other entrepreneurs I knew
appear in the media,

138
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,622
I felt the urge to start
something new too.

139
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,625
Yet, everything new
I tried to create failed.

140
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,418
And this was what worked out for me.

141
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,841
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

142
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,552
You'll handle it?

143
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,387
Yes. I will pay you once it's sold.

144
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,304
Great.

145
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,015
Okay…

146
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,788
-What account will you be using?
-Oh…

147
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,001
This one.

148
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,378
Let me take this.

149
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,130
Okay.

150
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,071
My proxy online sales business
went fairly well,

151
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,198
and I started earning
a small profit from it.

152
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,619
An ad campaign I did on social media
worked out well too,

153
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,371
and after six months,
I managed to save up a bit of money.

154
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,375
My follower count skyrocketed too.

155
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,257
Excuse me.

156
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,187
I have an appointment. I'm SHINGO.

157
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,659
Using social media to attract customers is
incredibly effective.

158
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,872
Yet, it won't work if
the actual charm of an inn isn't there.

159
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,377
It's not enough if the place
only looks appealing on the internet.

160
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,838
On the other hand,
it's a shame if an inn has charm

161
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,509
but isn't effectively promoted
on social media.

162
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,096
Well…

163
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,600
We have young staff who are managing
a few accounts on social media.

164
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,435
Don't worry. I'm good at what I do.

165
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,065
It hasn't made much of a difference.

166
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,778
The question is, is that person
a professional social media marketer.

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,408
On page 12, I have listed the performance
of the accounts I previously managed.

168
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:51,627
<i>Shingo started a new business
as a social media management consultant.</i>

169
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,671
Let me introduce a Japanese inn

170
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,674
that is perfect for
a summer getaway for couples.

171
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,718
It's surrounded by stylish spots
that are totally photogenic,

172
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,054
and it's also a foodie heaven.

173
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,349
The seafood at the inn is
top-notch as well.

174
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,853
And the ocean view from the window is
seriously stunningly blue.

175
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,354
On top of that…

176
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,650
If you mention you've seen
this review on SHINGO's account,

177
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,528
you'll get a free one-hour pass
for the private hot spring.

178
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,658
A Japanese inn that is perfect
for a summer getaway.

179
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,925
A Japanese inn that is perfect
for a summer getaway!

180
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,110
<i>Shingo's consulting services
were successful once again.</i>

181
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,031
<i>The inn's clientele shifted
to younger people,</i>

182
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,033
<i>attracting a large number of visitors.</i>

183
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,869
<i>It quickly became a popular destination.</i>

184
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,500
I successfully promoted
several hotels and guesthouses.

185
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,545
The business itself finally got on track,
and I made some friends.

186
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,124
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

187
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,545
Your hotel in Oita was quite the buzz.

188
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,046
It hit my highest revenue ever.

189
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,048
You're making good money, huh?

190
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,050
I hope you're not gambling illegally.

191
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,552
Nah, I'm clean.

192
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,766
You might not have to make money anymore

193
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:14,353
but there's a call for PR proposals
for a foreign-owned hotel.

194
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,690
Do you want to collaborate
with my company?

195
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,817
Oh, I didn't know that. When's it due?

196
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,862
We're working directly with the hotel,
bypassing the ad agency.

197
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,363
Is it legit?

198
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,657
Well, it might be a bit…

199
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,825
special.

200
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,661
Whoa, you're really pushing the envelope.

201
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,792
The presentation I prepared with Kondo
was able to beat out other ad agencies.

202
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,504
That's amazing. How old were you?

203
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,631
Um, I was--

204
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,469
<i>Matsuoka reacted to the term "ad agency."</i>

205
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>That term had her momentarily wondering</i>

206
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,853
<i>how many times she had been manipulated
by those who bore that title.</i>

207
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,773
<i>She instantaneously had stopped
listening to Shingo's story.</i>

208
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,737
So, I actually started working
with the hotel's PR director.

209
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,368
I heard he's pretty nice, but that
he'd drop me if the results were bad.

210
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,455
The turnover is quick
in rich foreign-owned companies.

211
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,043
Excuse me.

212
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,878
Come in.

213
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,640
This is SHINGO.

214
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,601
I'm SHINGO. Nice to meet you.

215
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,852
I'm Sato.

216
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,063
-Take a seat.
-Thank you.

217
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,527
So SHINGO, in the end, the inns and hotels
you were managing were rural, right?

218
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,779
Um, yes.

219
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:51,533
You might've been a star there,
but I wonder how it'll be here.

220
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,203
You're pretty much a newbie.

221
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,120
Right…

222
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,498
How old are you again? Pretty young, huh?

223
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,376
Can you handle our brand?

224
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,544
I mean, our clientele is different,

225
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,507
and that age group
doesn't use social media much.

226
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,260
But with this campaign, you're aiming
to target a younger demographic, correct?

227
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,888
Well, yes. But that doesn't matter much.

228
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,765
All I need to see are results.

229
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,811
My campaigns have been
successful most of the time,

230
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,939
so I just wondered
if I can leave it up to you.

231
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,982
I see.

232
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,234
I'll do my best.

233
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,944
Well,

234
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:31,031
if it doesn't work out in three months,
I can just drop you, so it's fine.

235
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,000
Thank you for your time.

236
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,626
-Yep.
-Thank you.

237
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,049
He wasn't nice at all.

238
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,178
I heard he's usually a really nice guy.

239
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,903
Great news for young people

240
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,324
who want to stay at a resort hotel
but don't have much money.

241
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,829
That famous luxury hotel is
starting an amazing campaign

242
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,415
for those who have
never stayed with them before.

243
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,835
The signboard might've
already given away a spoiler.

244
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,797
-Details about the hotel are at the end--
-Hold it.

245
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,924
-Oh.
-Come.

246
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,635
So…

247
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,930
What are you going to do with that?

248
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,893
First, I'm going to edit it
to target couples and upload it.

249
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,937
Will it achieve it?

250
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,565
Achieve what?

251
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,150
High views.

252
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,944
Look, my campaigns are always successful.

253
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,448
Instead of uploading
these short videos online,

254
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,034
I could teach you a more effective way.

255
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,162
I think I mentioned this
in my presentation.

256
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,330
Yeah, so?

257
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,541
You want me to do something different?

258
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,252
It's not about doing something different.

259
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,797
May I continue filming, then?

260
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,840
It's not that.

261
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,094
Look.

262
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,888
I want someone who listens to me.

263
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,891
Not being flexible about changes

264
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,685
shows that you still have
the mindset of a student.

265
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,355
Your videos have
never hit it big, have they?

266
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,398
Sorry…

267
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,360
You have no idea
how quickly I got promoted.

268
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,862
I got to this position in no time.

269
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,033
Instead of relying on social media,

270
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,202
you should reach out to the media.

271
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,831
Just tell them,
"PR director Sato is making a move."

272
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,041
I see…

273
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,228
This is the buffet.

274
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,690
One, two, three, four, five, six…

275
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,776
Although it's a buffet,

276
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,946
there are 13 chefs
who will cook for you on the spot.

277
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,920
Here is the buffet.

278
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,006
One, two, three--

279
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,980
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six…</i>

280
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:55,152
<i>Although it's a buffet, there are 13 chefs
who will cook for you on the spot.</i>

281
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,863
<i>This is a surprise even for me!</i>

282
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,700
<i>The rooms have large windows
with a panoramic view.</i>

283
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,787
<i>And even the bathroom! Voila, ocean view!</i>

284
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,706
Yeah, no.

285
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,375
We can't use this.
It's not suitable for our clientele.

286
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,919
For the younger clientele--

287
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,920
No.

288
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,504
We can't use this at all.

289
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,425
<i>None of Shingo's videos were released
during the contract period,</i>

290
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,260
<i>and the contract ended.</i>

291
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,600
<i>Six months later,</i>

292
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,103
<i>Shingo received a phone call.</i>

293
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,945
Hello?

294
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:44,451
<i>Mr. Sato, the PR director,
apparently passed away from a stroke.</i>

295
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,454
<i>I was wondering if you'd like
to attend his funeral.</i>

296
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,252
No way, I'm not going.

297
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,711
<i>Why not?</i>

298
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,965
Why would I?

299
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,385
After I endured all that power harassment
and unfair criticism,

300
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,470
he practically broke the contract.

301
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,139
<i>Yeah, but he died.</i>

302
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,267
So what?

303
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,519
What he did to me won't disappear.

304
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,980
I can go on bad-mouthing him
without a problem.

305
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,857
<i>Don't be so petty.</i>

306
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,819
I'm petty? What do you mean petty?

307
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,946
You know exactly what happened.

308
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,824
<i>Yeah, but he's already dead.</i>

309
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,285
What do I care if he's dead?

310
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,288
Does being dead suddenly
make him above criticism?

311
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,666
Huh?

312
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,793
Why won't you answer?

313
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,546
<i>You're not grateful to him at all?</i>

314
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,172
Nope, not at all.

315
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,300
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>

316
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,260
<i>I do understand your sentiment too.</i>

317
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,221
<i>But aren't you being petty?</i>

318
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:56,898
I mean, it would be nice if I could live
without holding grudges.

319
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,027
I know people like that exist.

320
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,989
But whether you can forgive someone
just because they're dead is

321
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,240
a separate issue.

322
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,995
Calling you petty
makes it sound like it's your problem.

323
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,122
-That's not fair.
-Yeah.

324
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,373
Right?

325
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,750
Well, yeah.

326
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,753
Towards the end, I was just complaining

327
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,921
but that's my story.

328
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,674
I hope no one has to experience that.

329
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:49,117
<i>Before entering the orifices,
Shingo posted his last social media post.</i>

330
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,747
<i>In his post, he wrote that
he would be entering the orifices.</i>

331
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,627
<i>And also that, if someone was holding
a grudge against him,</i>

332
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,922
<i>he would like to talk to them
before entering the orifices.</i>

Apartment number 813!

335
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,303
Why are you shouting out
the apartment number?

336
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,888
We wanted to see the corpse.

337
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,931
Want me to find out?

338
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,934
I'm not interested in your curiosity.

339

<i>Seven Orifices.</i>

340
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,938
This was the first time I regretted it.
