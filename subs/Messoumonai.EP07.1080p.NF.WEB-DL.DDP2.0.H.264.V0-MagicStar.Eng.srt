1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,169
<i>In 1522.</i>

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,673
<i>Erhard Brenz, who was a favorite
of his Uncle Nikola,</i>

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>started living in Wittenberg
as a Latin teacher.</i>

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,470
This is Erhard.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,347
He's very talented.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>Nikola offered to take care of Erhard
in all aspects of his life</i>

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>and introduced him to everything.</i>

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,318
<i>One day, as Erhard was walking
along a road,</i>

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,696
<i>he discovered a hole floating in the air.</i>

10
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,364
What is this?

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,242
Uncle Nikola!

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,537
What's wrong?

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>Right away,</i>

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>Erhard told his uncle about
the floating hole and took him there.</i>

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,464
<i>However, he was unable
to find the hole again.</i>

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,258
I swear there was a hole here.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,054
The change in environment
must be making you tired.

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,432
Let me know if there's
anything you want me to do.

19
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,644
<i>That night, Erhard wrote
a letter and left.</i>

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>I will find out what
that mysterious hole was.</i>

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>When I figure it out,</i>

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,904
<i>I want to let everyone know the details
through letterpress printing.</i>

23
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>Since this event is not recorded
in any official documents</i>

24
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,829
<i>and due to the lack of a clear source,
it is not widely known.</i>

25
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,860
Ms. Iguchi and Mr. Okamoto are
the only ones left now.

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,281
Do you know anyone

27
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,618
who entered the orifices
without telling anyone they were going to?

28
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:05,125
The people I knew mostly even
held their own farewell parties.

29
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,211
I don't know anyone
who entered the orifices.

30
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,131
Some people might've
just contacted a select few.

31
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,716
Some might've entered without me knowing.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
Yes, maybe.

33
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,180
Can I go get some more food?

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,598
Or are you starting already?

35
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,101
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

36
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,205
Can I make some soup too?

37
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,540
Oh.

38
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,751
Could you bring me some too?

39
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,669
Okay.

40
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,423
Should we make soup for everyone?

41
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,757
Who wants soup?

42
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,677
-I'll have some.
-Me too.

43
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,139
-Okay, let's make soup for everyone.
-Sounds good.

44
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,936
When I was in elementary school,

45
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,481
I used to challenge myself
with all sorts of things.

46
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,358
That's putting it positively.

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,153
How would you put it negatively?

48
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,864
I was acting without thinking.

49
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,823
-Oh.
-I see.

50
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,867
Everyone has moments like that.

51
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,539
At times, I've even thought to myself
that it might not be good.

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,627
There was a somewhat notorious lady

53
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,713
living on the lower floors
of the same apartment building as me.

54
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,258
She would shout out apartment numbers
from the first floor.

55
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,053
And Ms. Umemoto was this girl

56
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:44,682
who lived in the same apartment building
and was one year younger than me.

57
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,895
She and I would reply to that lady,
who would then chase after us.

58
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,523
Ms. Umemoto's parents were
good friends with my parents.

59
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,859
When Ms. Umemoto
entered elementary school,

60
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,528
her parents asked me
to walk to school with her.

61
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,491
I would tell her to move away
when a car came from behind,

62
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,826
and would act like an older sibling.

63
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,957
Once, I suggested a shortcut home and
we got lost in unfamiliar narrow streets.

64
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,167
Apartment number 813!

65
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,379
Apartment number 813!

66
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,422
Apartment number 813!

67
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,800
Don't you look down on me!

68
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,343
Did you hear that?

69
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,261
Uh-huh.

70
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,772
Yes?

71
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,233
You wait there!

72
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,735
Stay there! I'm coming up!

73
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,656
Don't move!

74
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,783
I'm taking the elevator!

75
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
I said don't move!

76
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,247
Don't move!

77
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,082
Hey!

78
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,734
It's that lady.

79
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,736
Just ignore her.

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,365
What's the matter?

81
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,951
Can you take out my trash?

82
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,996
What do you mean?

83
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,749
I have a bag of trash,
so can you take it out?

84
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,794
The trash disposal is on the first floor.

85
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,504
I want you to take it.

86
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,089
But…

87
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,884
Your room is closer
to the trash disposal, Ms. Kobuchi.

88
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,095
Why don't you throw it away
on the way back to your room?

89
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,983
Don't answer the door when you're alone.

90
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,359
Okay.

91
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:06,324
From that day on,
Ms. Kobuchi started coming every day

92
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,118
to ask us to take out her trash.

93
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:58,251
<i>Iguchi hadn't forgotten the promise
she'd made to her parents.</i>

94
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,505
<i>It was just that she was drawn
to the person standing in front of her.</i>

95
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,138
Yes?

96
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,102
My phone's not working,
so I want you to take a look.

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,063
Can you take a look at it?

98
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,622
If you hadn't answered your door,

99
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,000
I would have set fire
to that kerosene heater.

100
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,425
This here isn't working.

101
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,814
Who do you want to call?

102
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,774
What do you care?

103
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,405
Then…

104
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,159
Why are you always shouting out
apartment numbers?

105
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,996
I'm not interested in your curiosity.

106
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,958
I wonder why your phone isn't working.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,089
If you don't know what's wrong, go home.

108
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,018
She was quiet today, wasn't she?

109
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,436
Yeah.

110
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,611
<i>Although she knew she would get scolded,</i>

111
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,781
<i>Iguchi told her parents
about what had happened that day.</i>

112
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,617
Why won't you listen to what I tell you?

113
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,411
I hope you didn't take
Ms. Umemoto with you.

114
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,040
A few days later,

115
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,125
the lady jumped from the building.

116
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,297
At first, my parents
didn't tell me about it.

117
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,009
I don't remember who told me
but I found out,

118
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,138
and I went with Ms. Umemoto
to see the place where she was found.

119
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,019
The place had indeed been cleaned.

120
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,189
But…

121
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,776
Ms. Umemoto found
something resembling a stain.

122
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,612
We couldn't tell

123
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,323
if it was the lady's blood, though.

124
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,744
This was the first time I regretted it.

125
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,456
It was hard to forget, to say the least.

126
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,334
Was the stain clearly a bloodstain?

127
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,961
It wasn't exactly clear

128
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,588
but it was distinct.

129
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,631
It was blurred, though.

130
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,550
Because it was smudged.

131
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,556
That's why from then on,
I decided to not meddle in strange things.

132
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,143
Most people wouldn't want
to see the location it happened.

133
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,023
We'd never seen a dead body before,
so we just wanted to see one at that time.

134
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,736
Ms. Umemoto and I,
we wanted to see the corpse so badly.

135
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,529
Looking for body parts and stuff?

136
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,947
Exactly.

137
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,290
Want to go to karaoke?

138
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,333
Sure.

139
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,836
<i>When Iguchi was
in her second year of high school,</i>

140
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,381
<i>there was a group she hung out with
almost every day.</i>

141
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,815
<i>They were a close-knit group.</i>

142
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,026
<i>At times, they dated within the group,</i>

143
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,654
<i>and at times, they dated people
outside the group.</i>

144
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,603
<i>Iguchi was no exception.</i>

145
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,454
Where's Miki? Did you come alone?

146
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,164
Hm? Yeah…

147
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:44,597
Today, I will start by explaining
what "isolationism" is.

148
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,974
First, take a look at the kanji.

149
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,143
"Closed country"…

150
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,620
Did he reply?

151
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,998
Nope. Nothing.

152
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,167
<i>From this day on,</i>

153
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,711
<i>Miki stopped coming to school.</i>

154
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,969
<i>A week passed,</i>

155
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,556
<i>and a rumor began spreading
among the students.</i>

156
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,518
<i>The rumor was that Miki had gone missing.</i>

157
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,604
I don't know who started the rumor.

158
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,732
But my texts to him
didn't show any read receipts.

159
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,919
Ms. Iguchi…

160
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,713
Is your son there?

161
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,676
We don't know where he is either.

162
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,679
Did he really disappear?

163
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,972
We don't know.

164
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,682
Sorry.

165
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,061
It wasn't like he'd moved away.

166
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,106
But I got the vibe
that I shouldn't ask any further.

167
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,441
From then on,

168
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:24,405
my group of friends expressed
feelings of sadness for a while.

169
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,033
But with time, we started to forget.

170
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,285
It took a year.

171
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,481
Since we'd been dating,
his disappearance did make me sad.

172
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,153
Sometimes, we remembered him
and shared the sadness together.

173
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,490
We wondered aloud what he was doing
and if he was well.

174
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,993
But I…

175
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,704
I just assumed that he hadn't gone missing

176
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,165
and that he actually was at home.

177
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,613
What?

178
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,739
The mind.

179
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,282
-Oh, the mind.
-Right.

180
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,200
Whose?

181
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,618
Mine.

182
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,578
What I'm saying is,

183
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,081
I made up my mind.

184
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,791
Will you go out with me?

185
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,334
What?

186
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,669
I've thought it over,

187
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,129
considering the situation and all.

188
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,925
Don't you think it's pointless
to wait for him?

189
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,719
He doesn't get back to you,
he's not at his house…

190
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,849
I think it'd be better for you to forget
and move on to the next relationship.

191
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,023
But we haven't talked yet
about breaking up or anything.

192
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,526
The current situation…

193
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,238
doesn't really seem like
you're in a relationship, don't you think?

194
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,993
It's about the two of us,

195
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,621
so I can't just decide on my own
that we've broken up, right?

196
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
What are your feelings towards me?

197
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
Well…

198
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,799
But…

199
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,350
It was neither a yes nor a no.

200
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,982
<i>Right away, Iguchi confided in Umemoto,
who was a year younger than her.</i>

201
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,359
I think you should wait for Miki.

202
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,280
Umemoto had grown into someone

203
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,200
who could provide incredibly calm advice
in situations like these.

204
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,955
But if we go on like this without meeting,

205
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,042
I'm just going to be
in a one-sided relationship forever.

206
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,668
Hm…

207
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,671
Want me to find out
if he has a student job?

208
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,174
She could say things like this too.

209
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,467
Leave it all to me.

210
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,762
Thank you, that would be great.

211
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,809
But if it turns out
that he considers us broken up,

212
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
maybe I should say "yes" to Yamashita.

213
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,022
You said you weren't that into him.

214
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,529
<i>However, time passed by</i>

215
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,867
<i>without Iguchi and Umemoto
being able to gather any information.</i>

216
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,413
There was only so much we could do.

217
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,628
Wait!

218
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,671
What is it?

219
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,757
Oh, nothing.

220
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,718
I thought I'd booked a shift
at my student job today.

221
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,178
Turns out it wasn't the case.

222
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,930
Where are we going to celebrate?

223
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,350
How about karaoke, bowling,
then all-you-can-eat?

224
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,768
-Cool.
-Sounds good.

225
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,270
Karaoke first.

226
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,980
What? Karaoke first?

227
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,576
Miki texted me

228
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,203
asking if we could meet
for the first time in a while.

229
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:28,417
Since I had been putting off
giving Yamashita an answer…

230
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,838
Hey, Iguchi.

231
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,632
Here.

232
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,804
I replied to Miki with the location
of my favorite café.

233
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>She made a note of the things she wanted
to ask Miki, so she wouldn't forget.</i>

234
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,000
<i>Where had he been all this time?</i>

235
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>What had he been doing?</i>

236
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>Iguchi and Miki stayed in touch
until the day they were going to meet.</i>

237
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,634
<i>Although Miki stopped responding at times.</i>

238
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,246
In the end,

239
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,998
he never showed up
no matter how many hours I waited.

240
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,503
Five hours after the time we'd set,

241
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,713
Miki sent me one text message.

242
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,759
"It sucks that you had
your friend look into me."

243
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,928
That's what his text said.

244
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,329
It turned out he got involved
in some shady work

245
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,457
and ended up doing some time
in a juvenile detention center.

246
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,834
-Oh…
-Okay…

247
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:39,298
When he found out that Ms. Umemoto
and I had been looking into him,

248
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,176
he thought we'd found out
about his shady part-time job.

249
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,387
We had no idea, though.

250
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:51,476
I guess he wanted to know
if I'd mentioned it to our other friends.

251
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,858
Of course, I haven't seen Miki since.

252
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,903
That's it.

253
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,948
How should I write that?

254
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,453
I'll write it later.

255
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,292
I realized you can't be
with the person you love forever.

256
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,295
I never thought I'd get dumped like that.

257
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,966
Well, as long as you have
the wish to see a corpse…

258
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,510
Oh, that wish is already gone.

259
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,638
Now it's your turn, Mr. Okamoto.

260
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,556
Yes.

261
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:47,574
<i>Iguchi knew from Umemoto
that Miki had entered the orifices</i>

262
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,660
<i>but there was no record of it.</i>

263
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,955
<i>However, it was recorded</i>

264
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>that Umemoto followed suit
after Iguchi entered the orifices.</i>

265
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,465

266
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,262
I still remember a dream I had
when I was in elementary school.

267
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,639
Ever since that dream,

268
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,517
I've been living with
a feeling of constant mental fog.

269
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,146
You're not entering
the orifices, Mr. Ozawa?
