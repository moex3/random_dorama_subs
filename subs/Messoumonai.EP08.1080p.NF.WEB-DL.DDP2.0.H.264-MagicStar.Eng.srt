1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:06,089
<i>One day, as Hiroki Okamoto was walking
to a restaurant with his classmates,</i>

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,342
<i>he noticed that the town was
overflowing with advertisements.</i>

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>Ads were in every corner
of the restaurant,</i>

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>and even in the restrooms.</i>

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>Soon, Okamoto realized
that it was hard to distinguish</i>

6
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,730
<i>between what was an ad and what wasn't.</i>

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>He wondered if the things he thought
he had discovered had actually been ads.</i>

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>For example, this restaurant.</i>

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,532
<i>Had he been lured
into selecting a restaurant</i>

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,993
<i>that appeared at the top of a website?</i>

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,788
That was delicious.
Thanks for bringing us here.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,123
What is that?

13
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:45,086
<i>They found out through social media that
that was a giant orifice.</i>

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,506
Do you think it's been there
while we were eating?

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,049
Let's go take a closer look.

16
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,552
Unbelievable.

17
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,970
-Oh my.
-What's going on?

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,764
What on earth is that?

19
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,182
-Wow.
-It's huge.

20
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,642
-What is that?
-It's floating.

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,729
-Unbelievable. It's so close…
-Whoa.

22
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:28,922
<i>I…</i>

23
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,928
I still remember a dream I had
when I was in elementary school.

24
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,517
It's about me and my family going to visit
my grandmother during summer break.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,560
She lived in Sendai.

26
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,855
From there, we had to change
trains three times,

27
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,652
then ride the bus for 40 minutes
and walk for 15 minutes from there.

28
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:56,407
That's why we usually went
to my grandmother's by car.

29
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,039
But in my dream, we were going
by train for some reason.

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,710
As an elementary school kid, I hadn't
realized it was a dream at the time,

31
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,964
so I was traveling by train
without any doubt.

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,383
Then transferred onto the bus.

33
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,926
BUS STOP

34
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:29,065
One side of the road faced the sea,
where the morning sun shone.

35
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,152
On the other side were mountains
and the evening sun.

36
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,395
You must be hot.

37
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,354
Not really.

38
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,897
Since February,

39
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,567
I haven't been able to change
the light bulb in the bathroom.

40
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,987
It's been out
since your grandfather passed away.

41
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:03,034
There are so many things
I can't handle on my own.

42
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,121
I also can't reach high places
when I'm cleaning.

43
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,539
I'll do it.

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,501
Do you want me to ask
your neighbors for help?

45
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,086
Don't bother.

46
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,463
Can I have ice cream?

47
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,010
This is good meat, you know?

48
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,806
Yasuo's son brought it.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,685
I don't have a driver's license,
so it's tough for me

50
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,104
but he has one.

51
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,274
You can have ice cream later.

52
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,191
Okay.

53
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,866
You know…

54
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,495
I can't do anything on my own anymore.

55
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:07,015
<i>The sun will be shining
and the temperatures are expected to rise.</i>

56
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,727
<i>Along the Pacific coast, temperatures are
expected to exceed 30 degrees Celsius,</i>

57
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,772
<i>resulting in higher temperatures
than usual for this time of the year.</i>

58
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,941
We're getting up at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

59
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,443
Yes, I'm going to bed.

60
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,736
Good night, Grandma.

61
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,820
Good night.

62
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,115
<i>Dangerously high temperatures
are forecasted in many areas…</i>

63
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,064
So, I checked the time.

64
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,942
It was 9:30 p.m.

65
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,820
I had already taken a bath after all.

66
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:08,451
But I couldn't remember how I'd done it,
and that's when I realized I was dreaming.

67
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,078
That's why…

68
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,581
I tried to recall what had happened
before this dream.

69
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,916
Before I went to bed…

70
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,794
I was definitely at home.

71
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,214
I had gone to school
and had played with my friends.

72
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,466
I had eaten dinner, taken a bath,

73
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,427
and gotten into my own bed.

74
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,931
But…

75
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,850
even though I was dreaming,
I started feeling sleepy.

76
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,604
I thought if I went to sleep and woke up,

77
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,315
maybe this dream would be over too.

78
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,223
You're up early.

79
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,517
Yeah…

80
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,310
Are you ready to go?

81
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,729
Not yet.

82
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,781
Dad.

83
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,034
Have you ever gone to sleep in a dream?

84
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:32,952
Hm?

85
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,540
When you go to sleep
and wake up in your dream,

86
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,751
you have to wake up one more time
to return to the real world.

87
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,211
Yeah, that makes sense.

88
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,092
If this were a dream,
what would you do, Dad?

89
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,306
I guess I'd want to design my dream
however I wanted to.

90
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,142
I think…

91
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,853
this is a dream.

92
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,563
Oh?

93
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,315
Then try doing whatever you want.

94
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,567
You'll catch fish in no time.

95
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,902
Just make yourself believe.

96
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
I'm serious.

97
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,322
This is a dream.

98
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,574
Yeah, so believe you can catch fish.

99
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,742
Come on, believe it.

100
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,993
Look over there.

101
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,622
And imagine it.
Imagine yourself catching fish.

102
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,041
That the fish is pulling the line.

103
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:28,966
Oh.

104
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,762
Wow.

105
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,693
Follow me.

106
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,445
Okay.

107
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,625
What's wrong?

108
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,128
It's your grandfather.

109
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,967
He said he wanted to live longer.

110
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,056
When I thought about why we had to age,

111
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,060
I couldn't stop crying.

112
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,452
The next thing I realized…

113
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,206
was that I was back in bed again.

114
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,751
I thought I was at home.

115
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,589
But from the morning sun
I could see in the window,

116
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,842
I immediately realized
I was at my grandmother's.

117
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,470
Because there is no sea
near my grandmother's house.

118
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,807
As I thought to myself
I was still dreaming…

119
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,728
I felt a presence behind me.

120
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,615
My grandmother was watching me.

121
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,745
I checked with half-open eyes
so she wouldn't notice.

122
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,958
She was whispering something
the whole time.

123
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,254
Her voice was softer
than the sound of the clock ticking.

124
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,758
I want to switch places.

125
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,218
Please let me switch.

126
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,387
Let me switch places.

127
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,225
At first, I didn't understand
who she wanted to switch places with.

128
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,561
But I was scared.

129
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,441
So I wanted to go to sleep
and shut my eyes tightly.

130
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,817
But…

131
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,781
Since I was scared,
it was getting harder to sleep.

132
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,284
Then I realized something.

133
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,745
Since this was a dream,

134
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,665
I actually had to wake up.

135
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,249
Because this was a dream,

136
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,418
so…

137
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,507
I pinched my thigh several times
under the covers.

138
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,966
Dad?

139
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,179
Mom?

140
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,988
Dad?

141
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,408
What's wrong?

142
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,082
Where are…

143
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,251
Dad and Mom?

144
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,377
I don't know.

145
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,796
Anyway, do you want some of this?

146
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,382
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

147
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,593
It's good for your health.

148
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
No, thanks. Did Dad and Mom say anything?

149
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,139
It's good for you.

150
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,390
No, I'm good.

151
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,018
You're not hungry?

152
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,103
You want me to make breakfast?

153
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,606
I don't need breakfast.
Where are Dad and Mom?

154
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,358
We're back.

155
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,902
Where have you been?

156
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,738
Your grandmother wanted us
to go to the Otas'

157
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,366
because she had borrowed
something from them.

158
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,283
What's wrong?

159
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,910
You want to eat breakfast?

160
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,135
What's wrong?

161
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,560
Crying like that will turn you
into Grandma.

162
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,645
Just kidding.

163
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,684
I was seriously fed up.

164
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,928
Why are you gargling?

165
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,098
My grandmother had that bottle
in her hands.

166
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,144
She started begging me
to drink that drink again and…

167
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,065
Stop it!

168
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,832
In moments like this…

169
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,670
In movies, they startle the person
to wake them up, right?

170
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,966
But all pinching my thigh did was hurt me.

171
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,220
Today's a short school day,
so double check what you need.

172
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,311
I woke up at home,

173
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,105
and it was three days before summer break.

174
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,446
Morning.

175
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,326
Are we going to Grandma's again this year?

176
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,746
Why do you ask?

177
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,917
I don't feel like going this year.

178
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,379
We're not going this year.

179
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,672
Or ever.

180
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,133
When your Grandpa died,
we sold that house.

181
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,514
Coming to think of it,
my grandmother had passed away last year.

182
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,976
She had actually passed away
before my grandfather.

183
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,479
So then…

184
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,397
I realized that

185
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,527
I had already been dreaming when I assumed
we were going to my grandmother's.

186
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,363
And…

187
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,783
I couldn't remember
when I had started assuming that.

188
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,579
When I try to recall
when I had this dream,

189
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,250
it feels like it was
when I was in elementary school.

190
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,794
But it also feels like
it could've been later on.

191
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,130
I mean, today I'm fine
and I have a regular job.

192
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,092
But ever since that dream,

193
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,804
I've been living with
a feeling of constant mental fog.

194
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,223
It's not like I have trouble
in everyday life.

195
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,183
It just…

196
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,894
gets me thinking that
I'll keep getting older like this.

197
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
And…

198
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,732
I'm still not sure

199
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,443
if I really should enter the orifices.

200
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,075
I think that's okay.

201
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,578
After all, Mr. Ozawa did say
we could choose for ourselves.

202
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,247
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

203
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,382
How many more days
are you all staying here?

204
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,509
I haven't decided yet.

205
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,095
What time is it now?

206
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,973
It's ten o'clock.

207
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,600
Wow, it's pretty late already.

208
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,938
Should we clean up tomorrow?

209
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,939
Hm…

210
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,774
Let's do it today.

211
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,406
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

212
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,410
Okay, then.

213
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:09,911
Oh, let me.

214
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,913
-I'll take the dishes.
-Thanks.

215
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,206
I'll put away the chairs.

216
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,618
The first thing you need to understand is

217
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,246
that people can only share fiction.

218
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,915
What do you mean?

219
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,917
You might perceive something as red.

220
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,921
But you can't prove that someone else is
seeing the same shade of red, right?

221
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,218
Look at this, for example.

222
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,554
This is blue, right?

223
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,472
Yes.

224
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:15,519
But you can't know if we are perceiving it
as the exact same shade of blue.

225
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,270
Can you?

226
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,356
Right.

227
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,818
We can only communicate things
through verbal symbols.

228
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,863
The same goes for the orifices.

229
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,916
You're not entering
the orifices, Mr. Ozawa?

230
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,566
<i>Okamoto was pondering.</i>

231
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,486
<i>Does living a long life
really equal happiness?</i>

232
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,114
<i>That is what he was asking himself.</i>

233
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>At the same time, he thought about aging.</i>

234
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,707
<i>He also wondered
if the part of his life he had recorded</i>

235
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,586
<i>should be told as his own life story.</i>

236
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,755
<i>It started to snow.</i>

237
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,757
<i>But Okamoto did not move.</i>

238
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:33,638
<i>He was so deeply absorbed in his thoughts
that even the snow didn't bother him.</i>

239
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:38,101
<i>However, the next thing
Okamoto thought of was</i>

240
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,813
<i>that there was a café nearby
that he liked.</i>

241
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,942
<i>A few seconds after the thought
of hot coffee crossed his mind,</i>

242
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,696
<i>he realized that it was snowing.</i>

243
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,450
<i>At his favorite café,</i>

244
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,826
<i>there was a cat.</i>

245
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,871
It's a small shop.

246
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,126
They renovated a laundromat
that was next to a public bathhouse.

247
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,128
That's why,

248
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,007
there still is one small washer
in the café.

249
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,388
Then I suddenly realized that
it was the end of the year.

250
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,392
