1
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:20,820
What the…

2
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,091
There. Get in place!

3
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,096
CONSTRUCTION - NO TRESPASSING

4
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,401
What do you think you're doing?
No trespassing! It's dangerous!

5
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,504
You see… There's that over there.

6
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,174
-I just want to touch it.
-Are you insane?

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,275
You can't do that!

8
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:21,081
<i>But you see, unless I touch
the willow tree, I can't go to school.</i>

9
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,051
<i>That's my rule.</i>

10
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,321
Hey! Watch out!
It's dangerous! Are you insane?

11
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,789
Hey! Stop!

12
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,357
<i>Even if I told them,</i>

13
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,360
<i>there's no way
these guys would understand.</i>

14
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,700
Yes!

15
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,772
Two minutes to the convenience store?
Piece of cake!

16
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,307
Hey! Stop!

17
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:01,488
<i>To me,
everything in this world is just a game.</i>

18
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:03,890
Assemble!

19
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,825
<i>You see,</i>

20
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,063
<i>even though nobody will admit it,
unless you think like that,</i>

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,132
<i>we can't deal with this crap.</i>

22
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,834
Where's your enthusiasm? Do it over!

23
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,935
Yes, sir!

24
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,637
Assemble!

25
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,606
Do it over!

26
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,107
Assemble!

27
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,775
Too slow! Do it over!

28
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,479
You remember
the S irregular conjugation, right?

29
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,283
"Su," "se," "shi," "su,"
"suru," "sure," "seyo."

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,352
With that in mind,
let's go over this again.

31
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,921
Understand? Good.

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,190
And finally, Let's see…

33
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,927
<i>Every day is nothing but repetition
of totally meaningless stuff.</i>

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,430
You didn't know?

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,233
Well, you see…

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>There are guys who only ever
talk about stuff they saw on TV</i>

37
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,806
<i>that make you want to say,
"Who gives a damn?"</i>

38
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,911
What the heck are you drinking?

39
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,281
<i>Dokodemo Honey.</i>

40
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,515
What's that?

41
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,618
Food for rhinoceros beetles.

42
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,055
<i>There are also a wide variety of nut jobs.</i>

43
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,903
<i>When everyone's a bunch of brats,</i>

44
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,839
<i>you're worse off if you're sane.</i>

45
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,911
-Shuji!
-Yes?

46
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,880
-Want to do karaoke today?
-Let's go!

47
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,015
<i>Give me a break, you jerks!</i>

48
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,986
<i>You still haven't paid me back
when I paid for you guys last time.</i>

49
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,788
-You bet!
-Cool!

50
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,591
Oh, crap.

51
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,094
Our homeroom teacher, Yokoyama,
wants to see me after school today.

52
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,364
-What? It's no fun without you!
-What about me?

53
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,066
-The usual place, right?
-Yes.

54
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,567
I'll be there when I'm done.

55
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,370
<i>You could wait a million years,
but I'll never show up.</i>

56
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,838
And don't sing my song!

57
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,675
<i>If I play my cards right
and keep up my status,</i>

58
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,978
<i>I can make it through
without getting hurt.</i>

59
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,848
<i>Okay. Let's play the kind of cool</i>

60
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,586
<i>but helpful Shuji Kiritani
to the hilt again today.</i>

61
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,559
<i>Even this perfect guy that I am</i>

62
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,462
<i>has an enemy.</i>

63
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,799
Found you!

64
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,968
Kusano…

65
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,072
Hey! I heard that God is dead.

66
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,808
-Who said that crap?
-Nietzsche!

67
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,877
The philosopher Nietzsche said it.

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,315
But can God even die? I mean,
what would the cause of death even be?

69
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,285
Hey, come on. Don't ignore me.

70
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,755
-I know I'm the only one you confide in.
-Listen!

71
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,124
Don't tell anyone.

72
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,029
-We're friends, right?
-No, we're not!

73
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,197
Now you just listen to me.

74
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,001
We're not friends or nothing!

75
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,070
Oh, come on.

76
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,706
Why are you still so upset?

77
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:15,315
Okay then.
Can I tell you something as a friend?

78
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,349
Sure.

79
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:21,220
You know how you flap your arms
when you come down the stairs?

80
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,690
-I do not do that.
-Yes, you do!

81
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,561
-Toss that.
-What?

82
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,699
I told you to cut out the flapping!

83
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,006
I hate that guy's guts.

84
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,495
It's gone.

85
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,464
The willow's gone! How come?

86
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,733
It's gone! The willow's gone!

87
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,177
It's gone! The willow's gone! How come?

88
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,215
This was the only place
I could find comfort!

89
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,119
Hey! Fish! Why is it gone?

90
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,987
Tell me!

91
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,125
Willow tree! Where are you?
Are you here somewhere?

92
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,960
Willow tree!

93
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,528
You're kidding!

94
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,632
Wait…

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,568
Are you the willow sprite?

96
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,172
What?

97
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,308
What? What do you want?

98
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,111
Hey! What do you want?

99
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,382
The willow…

100
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,020
If you're looking for it, it's gone.

101
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,792
It was pulled up by the roots
this afternoon and carried off.

102
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh.

103
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,328
Is that right?

104
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,699
Since it was a willow tree,
it wasn't really suited for hanging.

105
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,902
Hanging?

106
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,972
Since it sways and rustles,
it seems otherworldly.

107
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,075
That's why I liked it.

108
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,280
Do you have a stomachache?

109
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,714
No. Why?

110
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,751
The expression on your face
made it look that way.

111
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,387
I was smiling.

112
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,690
That was smiling?

113
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,093
Smiling?

114
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,450
<i>The day the willow was pulled up</i>

115
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,386
<i>was the day she showed up.</i>

116
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,994
<i>The girl who seemed to hate</i>

117
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,564
<i>everything in this world.</i>

118
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,143
<i>Thanks to this moron who believes
everything in this world is for him,</i>

119
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,581
<i>my high-school life
that had been peaceful until now,</i>

120
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,084
<i>gradually started to fall apart.</i>

121
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,856
<i>I was stupid enough at the time
to not even notice it was happening.</i>

122
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,729
<i>What that meant for me was…</i>

123
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:09,615
<i>Actually, I don't want to
talk about what happened next.</i>

124
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,342
-Morning!
-Morning!

125
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,544
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

126
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,446
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

127
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,548
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

128
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,117
-Hello!
-Hello!

129
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,654
-I'm Kondo!
-I'm Hasegawa! Together, we're…

130
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,291
Destiny! Nice to have you here!

131
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,726
Did you hear?

132
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,262
The hot topic lately is Goyokudo.

133
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,097
<i>The bookstore on the shopping street.</i>

134
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,801
<i>The store that only allows
beautiful men and women to read there.</i>

135
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,236
I heard Sebastian tried going there!

136
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,373
That's right. The teacher Sebastian,
who's actually timid,

137
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
<i>he walked right up and tried!</i>

138
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,879
READING PROHIBITED
EXCEPT FOR BEAUTIFUL MEN AND WOMEN

139
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,316
<i>He lasted only seconds!</i>

140
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,920
-And that Bando tried reading there too!
-That gaudy…

141
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,457
That Bando foolishly tried as well!

142
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,591
Hey! Let me in!

143
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,295
What's your problem, you fucking geezer?

144
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,199
-You okay?
-Fucking geezer!

145
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,533
Prick!

146
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,269
What's your fucking problem?

147
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,638
<i>The poor girl.</i>

148
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,773
So he wouldn't even let her in?

149
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,075
-Yes.
-Isn't that mean?

150
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,444
Isn't there anyone
he lets read in his store?

151
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,647
-I doubt it.
-Isn't there one?

152
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,115
Who?

153
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,783
Mariko Uehara from Class A.

154
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,590
<i>Mariko Uehara?</i>

155
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,158
<i>That makes sense.</i>

156
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,795
Then I guess
Mariko Uehara's era won't end yet.

157
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,664
Big news! Transfer student!

158
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,132
-No way!
-Seriously?

159
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,700
-Boy? Girl?
-Girl.

160
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,069
I heard she's prettier than Mariko Uehara.

161
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,170
-Seriously?
-No way!

162
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,905
That's totally awesome!

163
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,307
That means her position
at the top will change!

164
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,049
Eight days a week, hello!

165
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,785
Shuji, there's a transfer student.

166
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,255
I already heard.
I sent Tani to scout out the staff room.

167
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,691
-You're the best, Shuji!
-No problem!

168
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,132
VICTORY

169
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,471
-You did it!
-You did it!

170
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,339
Is she a hot babe?

171
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,408
What's she like?

172
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,444
If she were sushi, like <i>uni</i>?

173
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,346
Like <i>toro</i>?

174
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,849
What? <i>Otoro</i>?

175
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,883
No way!

176
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,790
-What's that?
-Her ankle.

177
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,225
-Ankle?
-How can we tell from that?

178
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,128
Give us more details!
What actress is she like?

179
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,396
Akiko Yada!

180
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,430
-Akiko Yada?
-Akiko Yada?

181
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,400
You've never even seen Akiko Yada,
so how can you say that?

182
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,435
You've never even seen the real deal!

183
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,872
-She is totally cute, man!
-Okay! Fine!

184
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,006
The transfer student.

185
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,975
You took this?

186
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,477
By chance.

187
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,245
It's a miracle!

188
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,849
Nice work, rhino beetle boy.
I'll give you lots of honey later.

189
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,488
I've got a photo of the transfer student!

190
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,323
-Seriously?
-No way!

191
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,558
-Give me that!
-Let me see!

192
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,160
What a bunch of morons.

193
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,995
Yo! Here!

194
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,597
Did you hear?

195
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,198
You got more info?

196
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,468
Sebastian tried reading at Goyokudo.

197
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,738
Good photo.

198
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,639
Hey!

199
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,377
Sebastian got the boot for reading there.

200
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,646
What a real dummy, right?

201
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,184
Come on! Listen!
Okay, I'll explain it again.

202
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,387
It says only beautiful men and women
can read there, but that idiot…

203
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,488
What a moron.

204
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,557
Don't tell Bando that.

205
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,195
I guess he doesn't realize
what he is. Right?

206
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,365
-You jerk!
-What? What is it?

207
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,533
Don't fuck with me!

208
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,701
-Sorry! Okay! Help!
-Stop, Kusano!

209
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,043
She's here! The transfer student!

210
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,213
-The transfer student!
-A transfer student? Really? No way!

211
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,664
Good morning!

212
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,200
Morning.

213
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,403
Okay, get in your seats.

214
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,575
Okay, time to take attendance.

215
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,143
What about the transfer student?

216
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,948
Oh, right. You're right.

217
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,015
Transfer student!

218
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,250
Transfer student!

219
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,187
Come on in.

220
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,062
Come in.

221
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,899
What? Wait!

222
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,235
That's not Akiko Yada!

223
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,570
No, James!

224
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,472
-That's not Akiko Yada.
-Quiet down!

225
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,874
Quiet down!

226
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,477
The willow…

227
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,347
You know Kiritani?

228
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,317
She says she doesn't know you.

229
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,588
Shuji Kiritani is in such shock.
He's seized up.

230
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,990
Who's that supposed to be?

231
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,261
Okay. Why don't you introduce yourself?
Okay?

232
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,269
This is Nobuko Kotani.

233
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,504
Why don't you tell us
your hobby or something?

234
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,110
I don't have one.

235
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,080
Plans for your future
or a club you want to join?

236
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,749
-None.
-None? I see.

237
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,250
Okay. All right.

238
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,986
All right, everyone.
Let's make her feel welcome.

239
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,324
As for your seat, second from the back,
two rows from the window is open.

240
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,425
What?

241
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,794
I'm sitting here.

242
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,829
Bando, when did you start sitting there?

243
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:31,964
Ages ago.

244
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,701
Then go back to your original seat.

245
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,170
Why do I have to move?

246
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,373
Now, now. Don't complain. All right?

247
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,609
Go on back.

248
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,214
Sit at the empty desk.

249
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,057
Okay.

250
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,659
I'll take attendance now.

251
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,528
-Aoi.
-Here!

252
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,762
-Akashi.
-Here.

253
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,531
-Inoue.
-Did you see that?

254
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,566
-I saw it.
-Yes, I saw that.

255
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,305
Hey, you. You brushed off
that desk like it was filthy.

256
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,976
You think it's dirty 'cause I sat there?

257
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,444
Hey! Stop that!

258
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,347
Get back to your seat!

259
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,486
Kind of gloomy in here.

260
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,255
Destiny, come up here.

261
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,158
Do a gag to brighten things up.

262
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,861
-Oh, okay.
-We'll do a new gag!

263
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,162
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

264
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,166
A little hat makes a "<i>shoboshi</i>."

265
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,636
I can't understand you at all! Disaster!

266
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,144
After the gag,
don't look so worried. Okay?

267
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,748
-But…
-But…

268
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,450
-Oh, we're in sync!
-Oh, we're in sync!

269
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,020
-This must be destiny!
-This must be destiny!

270
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,354
Enough. Sit!

271
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,391
Thank you very much, Destiny.

272
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,092
-Here we go. Kawai.
-Here!

273
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,193
-Kimura.
-Here.

274
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,361
-Kiritani.
-Here.

275
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,729
-Kusano.
-Yo!

276
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,632
<i>I want you to try to
work this one out on your own.</i>

277
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,735
If the radius is 3.1…

278
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,574
Y touches these two points.

279
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,510
And X needs to be up here.

280
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,745
<i>"Isn't that chick creepy?"</i>

281
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,085
<i>"Don't you think that chick is weird?"</i>

282
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,192
<i>"Don't you think that chick stinks?"</i>

283
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,569
And what's negative three plus three?

284
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,804
Let's do that.

285
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,539
What's for lunch today, Mariko?

286
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,640
Broccoli dumplings.

287
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,241
Broccoli?

288
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,677
He's got it! <i>Manesuke</i>!

289
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,446
That's totally <i>manesuke</i>.

290
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,680
I envy you.

291
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,449
Shuji!

292
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,650
Your lady's here.

293
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,862
Today's is really good.

294
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,963
Seriously?

295
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,932
I can hardly wait. Let's go.

296
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,567
-Okay.
-Let's go.

297
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,173
Hey.

298
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,543
Is Shuji dating Mariko Uehara?

299
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,745
Why else
would they always have lunch together?

300
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,115
A bento lunch made by Mariko Uehara…

301
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,350
Think we could net auction that?

302
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,419
-Good idea!
-What an idiot!

303
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,222
It would go bad
by the time the auction ended!

304
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,760
This looks awesome! Wow!

305
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,268
Awesome!

306
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,642
I'm so glad to be alive.

307
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,345
This is totally great!

308
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,648
I heard the transfer student
looks like Akiko Yada.

309
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,150
No. That's a lie.

310
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,685
She's kind of creepy.

311
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,087
Really?

312
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,826
This broccoli dumpling is awesome!

313
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,595
-Really?
-Broccoli sure is good!

314
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,970
You know what?

315
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,741
That's where us girls
always have our lunch.

316
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,311
Do you think you could move?

317
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,882
Hello? Can you hear us?

318
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,719
-Hello?
-Something must be wrong with her.

319
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,555
Can't you hear?

320
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,861
I'm sorry! I accidentally hit it!

321
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,563
I'm so sorry!

322
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,831
Sorry. I feel so bad. We should go.

323
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,034
-Let's go.
-Sorry.

324
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,153
-Say…
-Don't do that.

325
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,857
If you're not careful, we'll end up
always having to eat with her.

326
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,427
Oh, you're right.

327
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,149
-What time you want to meet?
-What?

328
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,552
Did you forget?

329
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,422
-You promised to go out today.
-I remember. I swear it.

330
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,158
So what time?

331
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,629
I'm sorry! Really sorry!

332
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,999
There's something
I absolutely have to go to today.

333
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,533
What is it?

334
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,601
Actually…

335
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,837
It's a funeral.

336
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,405
A funeral?

337
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,708
-Really?
-Really.

338
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,478
I swear it. See? Look at this.

339
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,313
You're right.

340
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,314
Sorry.

341
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,051
-Let's do it a different day.
-What?

342
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,419
When's good?

343
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,889
When?

344
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,059
When should we? Good question.

345
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,803
I'm looking for
the place to toss out food.

346
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,173
There's no cooking practice today,
so not in here.

347
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,642
The incinerator!

348
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,977
You don't know where that is, do you?

349
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,247
-I'll take you. Okay?
-What?

350
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,550
This is that new
Akiko Yada girl in our class.

351
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,653
She doesn't know where it is,
so I'll take her.

352
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:05,957
Let's go.

353
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,498
What actually happened to that?

354
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,468
Someone ruined it, right?

355
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,770
Like Bando or them?

356
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,710
Well, it doesn't really matter to me.
It's none of my business.

357
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,949
FOOD SCRAPS

358
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,952
Shouldn't you go back?

359
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,455
Your girlfriend's waiting.

360
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,989
It's okay.

361
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,126
I mean, she's not my girlfriend.

362
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,964
What about the funeral?

363
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,834
Oh, that? That was a lie.

364
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,269
What about that necktie?

365
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,006
I found it in the street
on the way to school.

366
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,977
I thought I could use it
to get out of a promise I made.

367
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,012
Then

368
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,249
don't make promises in the first place.

369
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,453
-I don't think… I could--
-She's right!

370
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,389
Catherine!

371
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,958
Kiritani.

372
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,797
You won't always get away with
making up stopgap lies, you know.

373
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,434
What are you doing on the roof?

374
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,375
It's way too far
to go through the main gate.

375
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,910
It's a waste of time.

376
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:39,351
You. Educate this guy and make him
into an honest person. Okay?

377
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,025
-Who's that?
-The head teacher.

378
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,394
The head teacher?

379
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,564
I thought she was a crow-billed <i>tengu</i>.

380
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,404
It's creepy.

381
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,807
I heard it was some student's parent.

382
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,475
What's this about?

383
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,381
-Here you go, Mr. Yokoyama.
-Thank you.

384
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,549
Principal Iehara,

385
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,019
some loser is climbing over
our school's wall.

386
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,587
You're kidding.

387
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,422
I saw them too.

388
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,925
It was an older woman
dressed like a youngster.

389
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,927
How brazen!

390
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,664
-No. I think it was…
-What?

391
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,568
-What?
-Nothing.

392
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,735
I mean…

393
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,837
I know!

394
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,172
The students are gossiping
about it, aren't they?

395
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,008
You know who it is?

396
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,344
No… Well…

397
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,681
What everyone says…

398
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,849
What do they say?

399
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,324
It's a crow-billed <i>tengu</i>.

400
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,493
A crow-billed <i>tengu</i>? What's that?

401
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,428
That's just what people say.

402
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,696
It's gone.

403
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,064
It's gone!

404
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,066
My key is gone!

405
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,241
Found you.

406
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,312
-I'm saved!
-What do you want?

407
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,948
I lost my bike key.

408
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,583
-So?
-Let me ride on back.

409
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,484
No way!

410
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,654
Who said you could get on?

411
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,890
Please stay behind the white line.

412
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,192
Watch out! Let's go!

413
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,495
Don't grab onto me!

414
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,698
First it's a crow-billed <i>tengu</i>,
now a <i>Konaki-jiji</i>?

415
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,701
Hey! That Chinese cabbage is cheap!

416
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,571
Hey! It was on sale!

417
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,306
Turn left there.

418
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,377
Watch out! Oh, no! Watch out!

419
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,914
Next stop, Hirayama Tofu Shop.
Hirayama Tofu Shop.

420
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,448
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

421
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,251
-Want a drink?
-A drink of what?

422
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,553
<i>Mamechichi</i>.

423
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,091
Welcome back.

424
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,928
Mr. Hirayama, I'm taking two cups.

425
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,799
<i>Mamechichi</i>? You mean soymilk?

426
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,902
What? You mean this is called "soymilk"?

427
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,805
-Yes.
-It's not "<i>mamechichi</i>"?

428
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,408
Mr. Hirayama, how come you never told me?

429
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,144
Who cares what it's called.

430
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,746
As long as made good and proper.

431
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,083
Hello.

432
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,151
Fart!

433
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,288
Is this your house?

434
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,123
No. My boarding house.

435
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,225
Is your home far?

436
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:38,029
My home is on
the top floor of that building.

437
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,465
What?

438
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,234
That high-rise condo?

439
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,372
Your family's rich?

440
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,175
That's right.

441
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,045
What's your dad do?

442
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,983
My dad is the president of the company

443
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,419
on the top floor
of the building on the right.

444
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,621
He's a president?

445
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,222
A president…

446
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,658
Yes. A president.

447
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,328
Why are you down here with us?

448
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,240
<i>My dad told me,</i>

449
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,511
"You'll run this company someday,
so the fun ends at high school.

450
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,682
Enjoy your youth to the fullest!
Leave no regrets!"

451
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,586
-Hurry up and choose a cake.
-Just hold on a minute.

452
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,591
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do with my youth.

453
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,664
What I think is…

454
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,234
we do things that
nobody else has ever done.

455
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,535
Okay.

456
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,406
And explore the limits of your abilities
until you collapse.

457
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,074
I think that's what it is.

458
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,677
Then what should we do?

459
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,412
Think of that on your own.

460
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,281
Hurry up and choose one.

461
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,949
I'm telling you…

462
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,286
I don't care which one.

463
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,122
You know what?

464
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,094
If you can't choose one,
then you must not want either of them.

465
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,128
You think?

466
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,229
I'm leaving.

467
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,932
Wait! Ouch!

468
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,270
I don't want either one?
That's a possibility too.

469
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,639
The scales fell from my eyes.

470
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,607
Ouch!

471
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,178
I think a contact fell out.

472
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:34,913
Take care.

473
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,749
-Thanks. I will.
-Hey! I lost a contact!

474
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,322
It's late.

475
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:55,734
Shuji!

476
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,669
What? What is it, Koji?

477
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,270
-It's Mom!
-What?

478
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,573
-Just hurry up and come with me!
-What's wrong?

479
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,507
-Hurry!
-Watch out!

480
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,044
Hurry! Hurry up!

481
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,012
Dad! You're home early.

482
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,350
Shuji!

483
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,019
What? There was a plane crash?

484
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,921
It's the one Mom was on.

485
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,291
What? Seriously?

486
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,060
Seriously? How do you know?

487
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,828
-Her name.
-Her name?

488
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,997
-What?
-<i>These are possible Japanese passengers.</i>

489
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,533
<i>Takafumi Kanayama.</i>

490
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,068
<i>Nobuko Kiritani.</i>

491
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,570
Wait!

492
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,606
Her phone! Her mobile phone!

493
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,842
-Call her mobile phone! Now!
-Hurry!

494
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,278
Call her mobile phone now!

495
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,581
Forget it! I'll do it!

496
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,049
I'll do it!

497
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,723
Answer! Hurry! Answer!

498
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,591
Why aren't you answering?

499
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,439
HOME

500
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,248
She's not answering.

501
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,664
Could this be…

502
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,034
the call to confirm her death?

503
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
I can't.

504
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,005
You answer it.

505
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,677
-Hurry up and answer it!
-Hurry!

506
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,414
Hello?

507
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,052
Mom? No way!

508
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,687
How you doing?

509
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,991
"Where am I"? Nigeria.

510
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,994
I'm working, you know.

511
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,731
Forget about that.
What're you having for dinner?

512
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,966
Hold on.

513
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,569
Dinner! What's for dinner?

514
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,904
Hurry up and tell me!

515
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,005
<i>Gyoza.</i>

516
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,708
Hello? <i>Gyoza!</i>

517
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,309
<i>Gyoza?</i>

518
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,679
<i>Gyoza?</i>

519
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,748
<i>Gyoza?</i>

520
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,620
<i>Gyoza.</i> Really? <i>Gyoza?</i>

521
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,021
He hung up.

522
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,125
<i>Gyoza?</i> What's <i>gyoza?</i>

523
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,427
Well, you see, it's a delicious…

524
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,762
What did Mom say?

525
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,964
She said, "<i>Gyoza?</i> Really? <i>Gyoza?</i>"

526
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,767
-That's all?
-Yes.

527
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,070
Oh, so she's alive…

528
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,945
Koji! Let's eat! Let's eat dinner!

529
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,648
-She's alive?
-Yes! She's alive!

530
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,182
She's alive!

531
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,153
Thank goodness!

532
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,459
KOJI KIRITANI
6TH GRADE, CLASS 3

533
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,729
Why a baby chick?

534
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,399
What does it matter?
It just needs to cover the hole.

535
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,701
But that's the same as Watanabe.

536
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,171
-I bet Watanabe's a girl, right?
-There! It's ready.

537
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,606
That looks great!

538
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,442
-That looks delicious.
-All right! <i>Gyoza!</i>

539
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,012
-Hey! No fair eating one first!
-Yum!

540
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:29,847
No fair!

541
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,151
But you know…

542
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,154
Somewhere on Earth right now,

543
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,257
there's a family in mourning.

544
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,749
-And here are some flowers.
-There we go.

545
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,018
-How's that?
-Looking good.

546
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,453
-It's done!
-Yay!

547
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,855
Eight days a…

548
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,858
-Nice, right?
-Yes. Very pretty.

549
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,293
Those girls are
taking this a little too far.

550
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,367
Don't you think that's pretty uncool?

551
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,003
It's just a joke.
You like jokes. Right, Shuji?

552
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,240
Yes, but that's not funny.

553
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,609
I mean, that's so lame!

554
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,778
-Lame?
-Totally lame.

555
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,846
-It is not!
-Come on. Break it up!

556
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,616
-It is not lame.
-Yes, it is lame.

557
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,917
You're the lame one.

558
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,521
Bando, the comedy we like is
surreal and dry humor.

559
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,755
Fine.

560
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,158
-Okay?
-Yes. You guys are lame.

561
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,060
-Surreal!
-Yes, whatever.

562
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,297
-He's always like that.
-What jerks.

563
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,201
You died on your second day here.

564
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,905
-You poor thing!
-You poor thing!

565
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,574
-She ignoring us?
-What's her problem?

566
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,143
She ticks me off. Let's go.

567
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,953
She's going to get torn to pieces.

568
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,456
-Shuji.
-Yes?

569
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,657
-Pass.
-Right.

570
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,064
Well, it's none of my business though.

571
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,319
-Found you!
-Don't touch me!

572
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,787
-Hey. Wait.
-What?

573
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,623
-What do you want?
-I want you to have this.

574
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,459
-What the heck is this?
-Look closely.

575
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,394
It's a scale.

576
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,430
It's a contact lens.

577
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,366
It's a scale that fell from my eyes.

578
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,869
What you said opened my eyes.

579
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,537
-This is a contact lens, man.
-Yes.

580
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,406
-It's just like you said.
-What?

581
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,408
You see…

582
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,310
-What do you want?
-You see…

583
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm a guy who has no wants
and doesn't know what he wants to do.

584
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,517
So?

585
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,553
-You're looking down on me.
-I am not!

586
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,924
-What's your problem?
-I mean, there's nothing I want to do.

587
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,796
I think everyone's like that.

588
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,332
Really?

589
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,334
Okay, scale, goodbye.

590
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,704
Bye.

591
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,806
What?

592
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,477
Hey, just wait up a second.

593
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,612
Wait up a second.

594
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,649
-We've had it with you, bitch!
-Say something, Kotani!

595
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,450
You little bitch…

596
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,321
Who said you could ignore us?

597
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,226
-Who said you could go?
-Say something!

598
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,930
I mean, we're talking to you,
so talk to us!

599
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,631
-That's right!
-Yes!

600
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,836
-Feel good?
-Get away from us!

601
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,871
You fucking creep!

602
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,048
-Why don't you say something?
-What a bore!

603
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,491
Come on. Let's all get along, okay?

604
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,460
Get your ass out of the girls' restroom!

605
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,967
-Give me more!
-Sebastian's coming!

606
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,502
-Seriously?
-The floor's wet out here too!

607
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,707
Dang! This is cold! This is really cold!

608
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,080
This is cold! It sure is cold, right?

609
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,270
Soaking wet. We're both soaking wet.

610
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,742
You know,

611
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,945
can't you use your head more?

612
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:06,550
Haven't you ever thought of
acting more like everyone else?

613
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,585
That's right.

614
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,888
If you changed just a little bit,
things would be different.

615
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,460
I don't think I can change anything.

616
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,896
That's not true.

617
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,398
It's impossible.

618
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,068
There's no way I can change anything.

619
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,707
Giving up from the start is wrong!

620
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,018
I have wanted to change before.

621
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,857
My mom remarried

622
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,094
and I got a new dad,

623
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,663
<i>but I couldn't get close to him.</i>

624
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,036
<i>But I knew things
couldn't be like that forever.</i>

625
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,972
<i>So</i>

626
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,110
<i>I did my absolute
very best to call out to him.</i>

627
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,382
Dad!

628
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,454
Oh, sorry.

629
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,323
I married your mom,

630
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,294
but I'm not your dad.

631
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,964
<i>I was so ashamed.</i>

632
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,836
I was so ashamed, I wanted to disappear.

633
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,973
I don't believe if you're courageous

634
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,176
or if you open up your heart,
things will change.

635
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,078
I mean,

636
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,614
when I believe and open up my heart,

637
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,083
I only get hurt.

638
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,423
Now, that's no way to talk. Right?

639
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:59,296
It's all right. I'm used to being bullied.

640
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,535
It's always been this way
and probably always will be.

641
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,344
The hell you're used to it!

642
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,348
You mean you're fine with

643
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,051
getting sprayed with water
and your lunch tossed around? Are you?

644
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,259
How dare you decide
that nothing will change?

645
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,264
At any rate,

646
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,936
we've all got to live…

647
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,475
in this miserable school.

648
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,055
Bando and them are pretty vindictive.

649
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,159
They said they'd forgive me
if I read at that shop.

650
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,094
At Goyokudo, right?

651
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,531
Only beautiful men and women
can read there, right?

652
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,970
They told me to go and read there today.

653
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,772
Impossible.

654
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,209
They just want to laugh at you
when you can't do it.

655
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,144
That's mean. So totally mean.

656
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:22,847
That's mean.

657
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,081
Let's go read there!

658
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,517
Hurry up.

659
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,892
What're you stopping for?

660
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,066
Anyone home?

661
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,208
Excuse me. Can I have some books?

662
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,344
Some books? What kind of books?

663
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,213
Oh, right. These are all books.

664
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,215
Let's see…

665
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,318
Okay, from here

666
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,320
to here.

667
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,257
-From here to there?
-Yes.

668
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:10,327
And can I leave them here
on the shelf for a few days?

669
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,629
Sure.

670
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,630
Great.

671
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,834
I'd like to do some research too.
Can I come here to read them?

672
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,103
-Sure. That's fine.
-It is?

673
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,772
Great! Hold on a second.

674
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,809
Let's go! Hurry!

675
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,710
Go!

676
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,615
She's going to come here to read.
Will that be okay?

677
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:32,516
Okay.

678
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:33,984
Sure.

679
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,121
You, hurry up and pay.

680
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,157
-I have to pay?
-You said you'd help.

681
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,197
Can I pay with this?

682
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,166
A gold card!

683
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,835
Sure.

684
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:58,909
-Hello!
-Hello!

685
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,912
Together, we're Destiny!

686
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,048
Nice to have you here!

687
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,884
At last, a new record was set!

688
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,653
They read at the shop
for two hours and ten minutes!

689
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,522
I was dumbfounded!

690
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,225
<i>-And who beat out Mariko Uehara?
-Who?</i>

691
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:19,096
<i>That supposedly creepy
transfer student, Nobuko Kiritani!</i>

692
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,966
How shocking!

693
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,837
Since he thought Goyokudo had
lowered their standards,

694
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,840
Sebastian went and tried again.

695
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,675
Sebastian? No way!

696
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,778
-There's no way.
-He'll never make it.

697
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,216
He's so stupid, it's sad.

698
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:46,290
READING PROHIBITED
EXCEPT FOR BEAUTIFUL MEN AND WOMEN

699
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,027
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

700
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,829
Kotani!

701
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,764
Kotani! Look this way!

702
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,400
Look over here, Kotani!

703
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,807
Kotani,
can you get a little closer to her?

704
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,443
Good! Thank you. Now smile!

705
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,412
Say "cheese"!

706
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,783
NEW RECORD OF 2:10 READING SET BY
TRANSFER STUDENT NOBUKO KOTANI

707
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,761
Goyokudo was so fun.

708
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,530
It's got the whole school going crazy.

709
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,198
They've got nothing else to do.

710
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,501
And nobody noticed
that we're the ones who--

711
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,236
Isn't this a great smell?

712
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,838
Really nice, right? It's really popular.

713
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,573
Seriously. It's popular.

714
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,809
Nice! That was so totally nice!

715
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,911
You should be happier, man.

716
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,681
This will stop Kotani
from getting bullied.

717
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,418
No, it won't.
The bullying will start again in no time.

718
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,486
Really? You think so?

719
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,623
Listen.

720
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,192
She was way down here.

721
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:59,296
If you want to make her popular,
bringing her to normal isn't enough.

722
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:04,368
Unless she becomes top class,
people's minds won't change.

723
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,572
Idea! Okay then. Why don't we take Kotani

724
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,375
to that top-class level?

725
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,943
It's not that easy.

726
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,048
She might need to change
on the inside too.

727
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,883
What's on the inside doesn't matter.

728
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,920
If everyone thinks you're beautiful,
you're beautiful.

729
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,189
If everyone wants something,
the price goes up.

730
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,292
There are people who can
make that stuff happen.

731
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,194
Cut that out!

732
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,129
Who is it that can make that happen?

733
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,065
Those people over there.

734
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,901
What? My dad?

735
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,937
Don't be stupid. It's not one person.

736
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:44,508
It's people who think of ways
to get people to spend more money.

737
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,544
They make hits out of so-so songs.

738
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,180
They turn ordinary girls into pop idols.

739
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,117
They create long lines
outside lousy ramen shops.

740
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,521
I guess you could call them "producers."

741
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,592
Really? Then I'll do that.

742
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,793
What?

743
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,463
Why don't we make Kotani
the most popular person at school?

744
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,698
What for?

745
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,833
Remember what you said?

746
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,604
Do what nobody's done before
and explore our limits.

747
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,805
Yes, but…

748
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:19,810
We'll be Kotani's producers!

749
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,647
-We will?
-Yes, we will.

750
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,685
Wait a second. You're more the type
who needs a producer yourself.

751
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,521
That's fine too.

752
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,357
-You be my producer too.
-Why do I have to do that?

753
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,728
Come on. Please! Producer Shuji Kiritani!

754
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:47,971
I finally see what my youth is for!

755
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,008
Thanks, man.

756
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,514
NEW RECORD OF 2:10 READING SET BY
TRANSFER STUDENT NOBUKO KOTANI

757
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,585
I wonder if the world can be changed

758
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:03,987
even by us guys.

759
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,595
No.

760
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,131
Why?

761
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,570
How come?

762
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,507
I don't like lying.

763
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,111
Like at that bookstore.
I mean, I'm not beautiful.

764
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,881
But that's how it is now.

765
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,084
Who cares? What matters is everyone saw.

766
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,555
I'm going to tell everyone
the truth about it.

767
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,023
How come?

768
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,092
-Don't do that.
-Kotani!

769
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,463
Don't you think this is your chance?

770
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,836
Unless you've got the will to change,
you'll be bullied forever!

771
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,539
You'll be torn up from the roots.

772
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,309
Like that willow tree.

773
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,946
Is that what you want?

774
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,049
I already told you!

775
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,285
I can't change.

776
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,556
Wherever I go in this world,
it's the same everywhere.

777
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,895
It's all just a world
where I don't belong.

778
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,997
Then build it.

779
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,668
A world you can live in…

780
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
I'll build it for you.

781
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,876
Did you hear that?
Let him build it for you.

782
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,713
I don't want that.

783
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,350
Oh, well.

784
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:43,987
"Kotani."

785
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,357
"I'll build it for you."

786
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,227
Dang! You're totally into this!

787
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,831
Even if I am,
it'll never happen if she's like that.

788
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,166
Word.

789
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:03,073
Your youth has crumbled into pieces.

790
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:04,942
Pow!

791
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,948
Word…

792
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,689
Hey, Kiritani. Give me a hand.

793
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,291
Come on, Kiritani.

794
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,597
-This?
-Yes. The box on top of it.

795
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,174
You okay?

796
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,077
-Come on. Clean it up.
-What?

797
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,714
What the heck is this?

798
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,385
Hey!

799
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,356
It's a monkey's paw!

800
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,257
What's a monkey's paw?

801
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,260
You don't know? It grants three wishes.

802
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,730
This does?

803
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:00,731
Oh!

804
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,734
What luck! There's another one!

805
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,202
You can have it.

806
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,474
When making wishes,

807
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,578
they have to be said out loud!

808
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:31,228
I wish that my willow tree is
alive and healthy somewhere else!

809
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,399
-What're you doing?
-Whoa!

810
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,902
-You scared me.
-What's that? That's creepy!

811
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,804
You can have it.

812
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,142
Ribbit… What is this?

813
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,543
A monkey's paw.

814
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,079
Apparently, it grants three wishes.

815
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,248
Really?

816
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,217
I just made one wish,
so it's got two more.

817
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,919
Wishes?

818
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,656
What should I wish for?

819
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,191
How should I know?

820
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:08,832
Get lots of hot chicks,
make love to them, and get hammered.

821
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,833
Don't be stupid!

822
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,369
Kiritani!

823
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,275
-Boo!
-Kotani!

824
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,144
Wait!

825
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,946
Give me your autograph.

826
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,450
-Hey!
-Don't you have something to say?

827
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,852
Keeping quiet won't do you no good!

828
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,621
You're pissing us off, bitch!

829
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:38,195
Don't get cocky just because
you could read at that bookstore.

830
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,130
You listening?

831
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,133
-Can't you hear us?
-She's so stupid, she probably can't.

832
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,139
<i>Unless you've got the will to change,</i>

833
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,474
you'll be bullied forever!

834
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,277
You'll be torn up from the roots.

835
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,714
Say something, bitch!

836
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:01,685
Hey!

837
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,921
-Kiritani!
-What's wrong?

838
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,190
Bando and they are roughing up Kotani bad.

839
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,726
Don't Bando and they
have anything else to do?

840
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,028
Okay, I'm going.

841
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,663
-You're leaving?
-Yes.

842
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,032
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

843
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,034
-Ciao!
-Ciao!

844
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,070
-Ciao!
-Ciao!

845
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,211
Stop, Kotani!

846
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,646
Stop!

847
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,127
Stop, Kotani!

848
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,370
Stop, damn it!

849
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,606
Get the fuck out of the way!

850
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,249
Stop!

851
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,063
Get up!

852
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,531
Walk, damn it!

853
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,833
Come on! Walk!

854
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:32,209
-What's wrong?
-Get up! You fucking creep!

855
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,411
Hey! Cut that out!

856
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,147
Bitch! You fucking bitch!

857
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,061
Shuji!

858
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,542
<i>Please…</i>

859
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,712
<i>Help me!</i>

860
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,754
<i>Wherever I go in this world,</i>

861
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,258
<i>it's the same everywhere.</i>

862
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,232
<i>It's all just a world…</i>

863
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,770
<i>where I don't belong.</i>

864
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:41,244
-Kotani! You fucking bitch!
-Stop, damn it!

865
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,512
-I've had it with you!
-Stop!

866
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,581
Would you just fucking stop?

867
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,417
Kotani! Stop!

868
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:50,954
Stop!

869
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,660
Let go of me!
What's your fucking problem, you geezer?

870
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,795
Fucking cut it out!

871
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,303
What's your problem?

872
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,574
DISGUSTING WOMEN
CAN GO TO HELL AND DIE!

873
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,866
It's like I'm in
a totally different world.

874
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,603
I built this world.

875
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,087
PESSIMISM NOT ALLOWED.

876
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,856
YOU CAN'T LIVE UNLESS YOU'RE TOUGH.

877
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,557
NO KINDNESS, NO RIGHT TO LIVE.

878
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,573
May the principal's hair

879
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,343
grow thinner by the day,

880
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,980
and in three years' time

881
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:00,049
may he please

882
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,520
become totally bald!

883
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,595
Oops! Did you see that?

884
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,836
Here. You can have it.

885
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,938
I feel better now anyway.

886
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,776
It should grant two more wishes.

887
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,881
Do you hate the principal?

888
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,950
I hate his guts!

889
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,620
But since I work with him,
I can't help being around him.

890
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,322
It's such a pain.

891
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,128
When making wishes,
they have to be said out loud!

892
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,336
Just making their hair fall out
won't satisfy me.

893
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,640
I want even worse things
to happen to them.

894
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,512
You're free to think anything you like.

895
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,417
You see, in my mind,
I've killed dozens of people.

896
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,788
Your mind is a very useful tool.

897
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,324
Even if you don't do it,

898
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,527
just thinking it makes you feel better
and helps you keep going.

899
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,130
All right then.

900
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,201
This thing works absolute wonders!

901
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,438
Be very careful what you wish for.

902
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,096
I wish that

903
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,870
stupid Bando
would disappear from this world!

904
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,168
That's that willow!

905
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,872
Does this mean

906
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,108
my wish came true?

907
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,018
Kotani?

908
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:49,953
Kotani!

909
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,591
Kotani, get on!

910
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:57,961
Just hurry up and get on!

911
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,163
What for?

912
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,899
The tree they took out of here,
it's still alive!

913
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,568
It'll be planted somewhere else!

914
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,337
Hurry up and get on!

915
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,343
That's it! There!

916
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,278
Yes!

917
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:25,888
Wow…

918
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,791
You're right.

919
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,962
Hurry up and grab on. Hurry!

920
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:27,283
I bet that willow never thought
it would travel on the water.

921
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,287
You've got to live.

922
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,691
Because you never know what'll happen.

923
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,327
I never thought

924
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,032
there'd be a place
where we can start our lives over again.

925
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:44,834
Yes.

926
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,306
I wonder,

927
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,744
if I could become a big tree.

928
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,619
A tree so big…

929
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,723
that nobody can pull it up.

930
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,461
You've got no choice.

931
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,166
Oh, right.

932
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,037
Here.

933
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:35,251
Oh, that? It was torn.

934
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,768
Cancel my wish
that Bando disappear from this world.

935
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:07,410
I will…

936
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,681
live in this world that Bando is in.

937
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:29,532
Dinner's ready.

938
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,068
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

939
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,536
What's that disgusting thing?

940
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,807
Mr. Hirayama,
this is called a monkey's paw.

941
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,277
It'll grant any wish you make.

942
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,413
Don't be ridiculous.

943
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,048
Okay! I've made up my mind.

944
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,353
May there be world peace!

945
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,123
There! It's done!

946
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,695
Click!

947
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:04,133
Wonder if they'll have news that
peace broke out in the Near East.

948
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,601
Don't be ridiculous.

949
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,136
I'm serious!

950
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:10,439
This thing can grant one more wish,

951
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,742
so go ahead and make one.

952
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,244
-What? Me?
-Go right ahead.

953
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,481
Let's see… Okay.

954
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:22,285
Please cancel that wish for world peace.

955
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,620
Hey, man!

956
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,557
I got us world peace,
so what did you do that for?

957
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:30,960
Yes, maybe you did.

958
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,796
Maybe so.

959
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,666
Your wish really may have come true.

960
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:40,202
You know, there may have been
total world peace for three seconds.

961
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,840
You don't believe that!

962
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,579
-You don't believe that at all!
-Yes, I do!

963
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,281
Here you go. Extra-large serving.

964
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,631
<i>How things turn out
is sometimes frightening.</i>

965
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:16,072
<i>Before I knew it, I'd decided to
be the producer for Nobuko.</i>

966
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,609
<i>Top secret!</i>

967
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:21,911
It's top secret!

968
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,312
Top secret!

969
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,581
Don't go shouting it
at the top of your lungs.

970
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,719
You know, shouldn't we, like, give Nobuko

971
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:34,023
a stage name or a nickname or something?

972
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,125
Yes, that's probably true.

973
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,328
What's your name again?

974
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,997
Nobuko?

975
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:43,265
-Nobuko.
-Nobuko.

976
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,634
-Nobuko.
-Shut up.

977
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,738
-Nobuko.
-Nobu… Shut up! Nobuko…

978
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,339
-Nobuko.
-Nobuta.

979
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,341
-Nobuta? No…
-Nobuta?

980
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,310
-I like "Nobuta."
-What?

981
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,078
How come?

982
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,221
-What's this?
-Don't show him that!

983
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:10,526
<i>Sometimes, I wonder why in the world
I'm getting carried away with these guys</i>

984
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,895
<i>and totally regret it.</i>

985
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,333
<i>But then, this is</i>

986
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:19,902
<i>just another game.</i>

987
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,172
<i>What's the point unless I have fun?</i>

988
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,243
<i>But</i>

989
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,879
<i>at that time,</i>

990
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,448
<i>I had absolutely no idea…</i>

991
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,154
DIE

992
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:46,829
<i>Soon, we'd be fighting against
the incredibly deep and dark thing</i>

993
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,568
<i>that is human malice.</i>

994
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,738
<i>I made some rules to follow
to make you popular.</i>

995
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:38,474
One! Absolutely never mention
that we're producing you!

996
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,776
<i>You exist.
That's all you need to think about.</i>

997
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,013
<i>-Ugly pig!
-We're just saying what's true!</i>

998
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,748
-Let's end this.
-End what?

999
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,616
This whole thing about producing her.
