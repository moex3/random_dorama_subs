1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,707
Look at this, Koji!
This doll's hair grows.

2
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:08,641
Really?

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,643
Twenty on the scare meter.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,113
What a bore you are.
At least act a little scared.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,080
You are a kid, after all.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,449
Lady Mayonaka is way scarier.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,418
Who's Lady Mayonaka?

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>She's a woman with really long hair</i>

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,657
<i>who stands at the shrine
in the middle of the night.</i>

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,963
<i>This woman, she holds a doll.</i>

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,865
<i>If you look closely at the doll,</i>

12
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,503
<i>its face is exactly like the woman's!</i>

13
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,307
-It's Lady Mayonaka!
-It's Lady Mayonaka!

14
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,449
Really? That's Lady Mayonaka?

15
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,317
My friends at school saw her.

16
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,156
A long-haired woman?

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,493
The doll's hair grows.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,262
The doll's hair grows?

19
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,131
They still make shows like this?

20
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,733
-Mr. Hirayama.
-What?

21
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,036
-Your head.
-What?

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,371
Your head.

23
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,446
My hair… It's growing!

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,714
It's growing!

25
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,518
It's seaweed.

26
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,921
-Seaweed?
-Seaweed.

27
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,961
Yes, it is seaweed.

28
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,506
What do you want so early?

29
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,975
-Time for a meeting.
-What for?

30
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,045
We're Nobuta's producers, right?

31
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,217
Yes, I did say that, but it doesn't mean
you can come to my house.

32
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,986
How come? We're best friends.

33
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,456
I told you. We're not best friends.

34
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,592
Hey, wait up, man!

35
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,730
Come on! Wait up!

36
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,068
Hey. Excuse me, please.

37
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,174
<i>Hanging out with a guy like you
doesn't do me any good at all.</i>

38
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,380
<i>There's only one thing I'm after.</i>

39
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:33,853
<i>To play the popular guy, Shuji,
while enjoying life at school.</i>

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,588
Morning four meters!

41
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,025
-There it is! A new record!
-There it is! A new record!

42
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,527
-Hey, Shuji.
-Yes?

43
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,362
You know Lady Mayonaka?

44
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,198
You bet. She's that woman
with a doll at the shrine.

45
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,300
-Oh, man! You know?
-Of course.

46
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,336
Did you know this?
Who is Lady Mayonaka for real?

47
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,772
-Who is it?
-I heard it's Nobuko Kotani.

48
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,775
-For real?
-Seriously?

49
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,143
Are you sure?

50
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,344
Lady Mayonaka!

51
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,186
CURSED

52
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:11,191
<i>Turn this bullied girl
into the most popular girl in school?</i>

53
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,494
<i>I can't believe I promised to do that.</i>

54
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,133
DIE

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,972
<i>Why the heck did I say that?</i>

56
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,907
<i>This…</i>

57
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,510
Sucks.

58
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,347
PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE NOTICE

59
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,515
-Dad?
-What?

60
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,484
Why are you wearing that?

61
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,753
Oh, yes.

62
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,856
Pretty cool, right?

63
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,992
-You're going to work in that?
-I sure am.

64
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,761
-No way! That's so totally tacky!
-Morning.

65
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,664
Quit whining! What's wrong with it?

66
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,866
-What crazy clothes!
-What?

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,234
Oh, just cut it out.

68
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,403
Kids don't know what's good.

69
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,373
Yes, we do.
That's just plain weird. Right?

70
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,008
-Yes. It's awful.
-Just awful.

71
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,846
I'll have you guys know, I'm going to
the parent-teacher conference in this.

72
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,883
No way! It's too early for that!

73
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,918
Please don't! I'll die!

74
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,489
Hey.

75
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,224
-Shuji.
-What?

76
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,227
Someone's downstairs asking for you.

77
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,696
It's way too early for this.

78
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,097
That's for sure.

79
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,033
Shuji!

80
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,537
Yip yip!

81
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,811
Before rumors of Lady Mayonaka spread,
we need to put an end to it.

82
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,048
Do you have a plan?

83
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,816
Well, I do have something.

84
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,385
Excellent.
I always knew you had it in you.

85
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,755
Oh, yeah. But first, this.

86
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,893
I made some rules to follow
to make you popular.

87
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,862
Nice.

88
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,367
"One! Absolutely never mention
that we're producing you!"

89
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,608
It's best if you read it
out loud yourself. Okay?

90
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,609
Right.

91
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,582
"One. Absolutely never mention
that we're producing you.

92
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,152
Two. You can never refuse to do
what the producers tell you to do.

93
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,887
Three. Never act without permission.

94
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,191
Four. Our contract ends
when you become popular.

95
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,525
Quitting isn't allowed as hereinbefore."

96
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,562
At the very least,
we need you to follow those rules.

97
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,569
I know this is sudden,
but let's chop off that hair.

98
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,570
What?

99
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,405
What are you so surprised about?

100
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:17,577
But a woman's hair is her pride. Right?

101
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,713
You mean you like your hair that way?

102
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,583
Actually, I hate it.

103
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,085
Then let's do it.

104
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,555
Split ends.

105
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,523
Why not?

106
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,727
I just can't do it on my own.

107
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,695
-Look. Split ends.
-What?

108
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,432
This hair is cursed!

109
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,404
She totally said it was cursed.

110
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,007
I was totally touching
her cursed split ends!

111
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,985
Whoa! That's awesome!

112
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,087
Shuji!

113
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,188
Your lady's here.

114
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,101
-I made meatballs today.
-What?

115
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,958
By the way, with girls…

116
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,763
Cutting your hair is
a pretty serious thing, right?

117
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,398
You bet it's serious.

118
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,834
Is that right?

119
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,040
But if you wanted me to cut it,
Shuji, then I would.

120
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,043
-Want me to cut it?
-No.

121
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,913
-Want me to cut it?
-Shuji.

122
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,516
Shuji.

123
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,686
The mystery's been solved.

124
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,188
I know what the curse is!

125
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,389
"Curse"?

126
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,558
What? Hey!

127
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,827
-I'll be back in a second.
-That's good!

128
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,230
-I'll be right back.
-What is that? It's great!

129
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,965
-Red miso? White miso?
-Forget that!

130
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,234
-Blue miso? No such thing!
-Don't cut your hair!

131
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,469
-See you!
-Don't cut it! If you cut it, I'll cry!

132
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,872
I'll cry until I ran out of tears!

133
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,149
Hello!

134
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,659
I knew it. You're Lady Mayonaka.

135
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,396
Is this why you won't cut your hair?

136
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,601
It has to be just like hers.

137
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,673
It totally looks like you.

138
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,011
She's my one and only friend.

139
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,680
What? This is your friend?

140
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,450
Your friend is a doll? Hilarious.

141
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,790
She's seen
all the times I've been bullied.

142
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,593
She's always encouraged me.

143
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,529
But that's still no reason
to always keep it around.

144
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:29,035
I've tried to get rid of it
and took it to a shrine,

145
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,103
but I couldn't let go of it.

146
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,374
That's no curse.
It's a spell you put on yourself.

147
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,812
I can't change and leave her behind.

148
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,847
I see.

149
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,353
Okay. I've got an idea.

150
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,257
Is this about the length you want?

151
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,593
How about it? Is this good?

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,396
Can you make it a little more shaggy?

153
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,566
-Shaggy? Okay.
-One shaggy, coming up!

154
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,069
Akiko Yada, please.

155
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,904
-Like Akiko Yada?
-Yes, Akiko Yada.

156
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,739
She doesn't know what that means.

157
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,675
It's done! Smooch!

158
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,447
How pretty.

159
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,581
You bet.

160
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,483
You can cut your hair now, right?

161
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,885
-What?
-Wait!

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,454
Hey!

163
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,027
I thought you said
it had to be like the doll's.

164
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,297
-But I still don't want to get it cut.
-Why?

165
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,835
I don't think I can do something
different than what I like.

166
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,771
Then what do you like?

167
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,743
If this rumor keeps spreading,
you'll be treated like a monster forever.

168
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,412
Now just calm down, Shuji.

169
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,881
What?

170
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,349
All right…

171
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,953
Would you wear that?

172
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,458
-What?
-We couldn't wear that.

173
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,462
To me, cutting my hair is
the same as you doing that.

174
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,535
Fine. Whatever.

175
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,837
Let's end this.

176
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,472
End what?

177
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,341
This whole thing about producing her.

178
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,043
What?

179
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,278
There's no point
if she won't follow the rules.

180
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,849
Hold on there.

181
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,787
Hey!

182
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,290
Hey, both of you!

183
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,458
Wait!

184
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,262
He called me "Jaiko"!

185
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,397
"Jaiko"? For a nickname?

186
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,399
That would make anyone mad.

187
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,734
It ticked me off.

188
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,735
How could someone say that?

189
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,303
That's awful.

190
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,242
Why am I hiding?

191
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,611
Yes, that's hilarious.

192
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:57,516
And you know what?
Shuji said he'd cry if I cut my hair.

193
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,852
Then cut it and make him cry.

194
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,687
Good idea! I'll make him cry!

195
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,489
This sucks.

196
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,025
What will you buy?

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,096
Roasted green tea? Whole green tea?

198
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,364
Or maybe refined green tea?

199
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,370
<i>The one I want to cut her hair won't</i>

200
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,674
<i>and the one who doesn't need to will.</i>

201
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,175
<i>What the heck's going on?</i>

202
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,277
<i>Maybe I will cry!</i>

203
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,916
I'm home.

204
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,554
-You're home early today?
-Yes.

205
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,628
What's the matter?

206
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,033
That. Everybody totally hated it.

207
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,536
Well, of course, they did.

208
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,606
Shuji.

209
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,742
Wear what you want while you can.

210
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,947
When you grow up, things like
people's opinions, common sense,

211
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:06,285
a good image, your boss's mood,
your impression on clients…

212
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:12,558
All those things weigh you down
so you can't wear what you like.

213
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,294
Dad.

214
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,864
Wear that to
the parent-teacher conference.

215
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,765
Okay.

216
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,200
What?

217
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,835
I can?

218
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,237
Well, I don't really like it though.

219
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,006
-Then forget it.
-It's okay.

220
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:27,940
It is?

221
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,709
Wear it to the parent-teacher conference.

222
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,963
Maybe I shouldn't go saying stuff
about other people's taste.

223
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,103
Get your act together, people!

224
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,240
Show some spirit, even if it's fake!

225
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,179
Oh, dear!

226
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,348
-Bye!
-Bye!

227
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,853
Kusano! Show some spirit!

228
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,496
-Can I borrow your deodorant?
-Sure!

229
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,033
Bando. You sure you've taken
enough PE to graduate?

230
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,370
-Everyone says that. Is it bad?
-Yes, it's really bad.

231
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,205
I guess I can't use that excuse anymore.

232
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,707
Yes, you can't. No way.

233
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,243
-You sure can't. You got deodorant?
-Yes, I do.

234
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,244
-Can I use it?
-Sure.

235
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,347
-You've skipped a lot too.
-No, I've done PE plenty.

236
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,450
You're just leaving me behind
and throwing away…

237
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,784
-Kiritani.
-Here.

238
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,052
-Kusano.
-Here.

239
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:47,953
Kotani.

240
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,355
-Kondo.
-Here.

241
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,256
Wait.

242
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,991
Where's Kotani?

243
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,995
She was here this morning.
Anyone know where she is?

244
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,035
Well, all right then. Sato.

245
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,236
-Here.
-Takada.

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,952
No way. That sucks.

247
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,687
Who would do that?

248
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,759
I bet it was those guys.

249
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,961
In fact, they're the only ones who would.

250
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,565
Hey, you bitches!

251
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,334
Don't blame every damn thing on us!

252
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,136
We never did that shit!

253
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,473
-What's going on?
-Misaki and Nami are screwed!

254
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,475
-Attack, Shuji!
-What? Why me?

255
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,911
What? What's going on?

256
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,013
-They're ticking us off!
-What for?

257
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,250
They painted "ugly pig"
on Kotani's uniform!

258
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,518
You did that?

259
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,420
The fuck we did! We wouldn't do that!

260
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,389
-That's right! The hell we did!
-Anyone could have done it!

261
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,024
All right. All right.

262
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,895
You're right. You've got a bad attitude
and bad looks, but you'd never lie.

263
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,264
I told you. We didn't do it!

264
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,099
-That's right!
-They say they didn't.

265
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,767
-Did you?
-I told you, no!

266
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,302
We didn't do it!

267
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,537
"We didn't do it!"

268
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,875
What're we going to do
about being her producers?

269
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,244
I told you. Buzz off!

270
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,747
Dang it! What about being her producers?

271
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,218
Hey, come on.

272
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,287
Whoa! No U-turns!

273
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,924
I told you. Watch out!

274
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,343
Come on, Shuji. Where we going?

275
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,511
Tell me!

276
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,692
Watch out.

277
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,060
Can I ask a favor?

278
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,529
Can I borrow some money?

279
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,031
Sure.

280
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,066
Thank you. I'll pay you back.

281
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,801
Yip yip.

282
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,913
Nobuta!

283
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,257
Say…

284
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,759
Let's cut your hair.

285
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:46,298
Cut your hair and show everyone
you're not an ugly pig.

286
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,536
You know, any way you look at it,
yours is way prettier.

287
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,503
They're the same!

288
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,441
-I mean, this thing is pink!
-Yes, but mine's green.

289
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,411
Roar!

290
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,314
Zip this up. Hurry. Zip it up.

291
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,983
What's wrong?

292
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,187
That's how she looks when she smiles.

293
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,058
She's smiling!

294
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,060
Poke.

295
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,695
We got a smile!

296
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,031
I…

297
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,601
I'll cut my hair.

298
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,075
Please.

299
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,245
Sure thing.

300
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,913
UGLY PIG

301
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,182
Right when we were going to
change her image,

302
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,618
this sure won't help.

303
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,090
You know, I was thinking,
and this could be our chance.

304
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,226
"This"? You mean this?

305
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:48,894
Let's see…

306
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,700
"Students must wear their uniform.

307
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:59,104
However, if the uniform is unable
to be worn for some reason,

308
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,407
immediately submit an application
for wearing ordinary clothes.

309
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,244
Only upon approval
may ordinary clothes be worn."

310
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,280
Clearly, you can't wear this.

311
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,315
Isn't that right?

312
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,086
In other words,
as long as they give approval,

313
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,421
you can wear ordinary clothes to school.

314
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:21,059
Right. So you should wear
totally pretty clothes to school.

315
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,695
Then the school would go crazy.

316
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,832
This really is awful.

317
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,168
And you don't have any idea who did this?

318
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,003
I see.

319
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,273
And there's no way
we can figure out who did it.

320
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,409
Anyway, I'll report to
the principal that this happened.

321
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,178
Go on.

322
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,349
I need approval.

323
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,320
Yes. Oh, yes.

324
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,256
Oh, darn. The principal went home.

325
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,292
Is tomorrow all right?

326
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,826
-Mr. Yokoyama.
-Yes?

327
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,830
You want her to wear that
to school again tomorrow?

328
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,833
But we need the principal's seal.

329
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,305
If someone painted "coward" on your suit,
could you teach like that?

330
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,673
"Coward"?

331
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,308
I'll take responsibility.

332
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,009
Oh, thank you.

333
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,911
Here.

334
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,450
Wear the prettiest clothes
you can tomorrow.

335
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,321
And give the finger to whoever did that.

336
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,497
Yes!

337
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,600
This is what I recommend.

338
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,070
It would go nice with jeans too.

339
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,005
-Over there…
-What?

340
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,976
There's an expensive book there.
Be careful with it.

341
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,312
-There's an expensive book.
-An expensive book?

342
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,848
I wonder which one it is.

343
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,824
PRICE: 100,000,000 YEN
(TAX NOT INCLUDED)

344
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,093
A hundred million yen?

345
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,395
A hundred million?

346
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,200
It's by Delphine Sakurada.

347
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,035
-You know them?
-No.

348
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,772
That's my pen name.

349
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,441
Delphine?

350
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,876
<i>Oui.</i>

351
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,948
-Holy cow! We'll choose from these?
-Yes.

352
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,952
First, we need to decide
how you want people to see you.

353
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,824
How about like this,
the honor-student type?

354
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,694
Teachers and parents would
really like you.

355
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:36,595
Right? Okay.

356
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:41,500
Or if you want to look cute, angel style.

357
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,938
If you want to express individuality,
this little-devil style.

358
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,643
I like this!

359
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,515
This looks like a total slut.
No way. Nothing slutty.

360
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,216
Rejected.

361
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,085
I didn't realize

362
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,654
there were so many styles.

363
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,523
Really? It's the same with guys.

364
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,225
I mean, there are crew cuts, but…

365
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,930
<i>there's the classy crew cut
done at a hair salon, right?</i>

366
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:17,135
<i>Then there's the country bumpkin crew cut
for guys who don't want to bother.</i>

367
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,108
<i>And there's the refreshing crew cut
for guys into sports.</i>

368
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,813
<i>And the frightening crew cut
for guys who stare you down.</i>

369
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,582
How do you want people to see you, Nobuta?

370
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,753
I've never thought about it.

371
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:37,823
Listen.

372
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,793
That's the only thing
that everyone at school thinks about.

373
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,296
"I want to be liked."

374
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,764
"I don't want to be made fun of."

375
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,467
"I want everyone to pay attention to me."

376
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,236
Everyone's focusing totally on that stuff.

377
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,206
So you also need to think about
that kind of stuff,

378
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,508
even just a little bit. Okay?

379
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,945
Of course you want guys to like you,

380
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,815
but if girls don't like you too,
you'll never make points.

381
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,853
You bet.
I thought up a plan too. Have a look.

382
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,957
Here. See?

383
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,960
Nice. Awesome!

384
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:15,861
Want to do this?

385
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,747
<i>I don't think
anyone's actually got self-confidence.</i>

386
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,616
<i>We're all timid.</i>

387
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,556
<i>We can barely handle
dealing with ourselves.</i>

388
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,758
<i>We don't have time to think about others.</i>

389
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,335
<i>So there's no need to be afraid.</i>

390
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,905
<i>First, don't worry about
getting people to like you.</i>

391
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,610
<i>Get everyone to realize
that you just exist.</i>

392
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,163
No way!

393
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,637
Okay. Put your chest out!

394
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,340
More! Stand up straight.

395
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:14,546
When you greet people, speak up!

396
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,449
Remember that.

397
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,889
Okay. Go on now.

398
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,560
Stand up straighter.

399
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,396
Bye.

400
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,805
<i>Listen.</i>

401
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,943
<i>You exist.
That's all you need to think about.</i>

402
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,723
Morning.

403
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,525
Morning.

404
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,695
-Good morning.
-Morning.

405
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,971
-Good morning.
-Morning.

406
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,947
Good morning.

407
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,517
Morning.

408
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,604
Good morning.

409
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,306
"Good morning"?

410
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,227
<i>Good morning.</i>

411
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,769
<i>Good morning!</i>

412
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,010
<i>I exist!</i>

413
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,280
<i>Good morning!</i>

414
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,871
Good…

415
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,406
How cute!

416
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,640
I like it!

417
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,776
-She's so pretty!
-I totally like it!

418
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,112
-Kotani! Good morning!
-Holy crap!

419
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,947
Why is she in ordinary clothes?

420
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,816
-Hey, baby!
-Nice!

421
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:05,817
Who are you?

422
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,453
That's Kotani!

423
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,288
Hey, look at this.

424
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,123
That's this jacket in another color.

425
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,292
-No way!
-25,200 yen?

426
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,894
-No way!
-Let's ask!

427
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,262
Wait!

428
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,932
Was that jacket 25,200 yen?

429
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,937
I knew it! That's it!

430
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,472
It's way better than the photo!

431
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,473
Totally!

432
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,542
Hello!

433
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:35,780
Kotani!

434
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,116
She cut her hair.

435
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,685
If she were sushi,
she'd be <i>otoro</i> from the Indian Ocean!

436
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,787
-<i>Otoro</i>!
-Good morning!

437
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,556
The king of <i>toro</i>!

438
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,890
I can't hear you!

439
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,460
-This is incredible!
-Holy cow!

440
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,897
Hello!

441
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,468
-Did you see?
-I sure did! Everyone did!

442
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,137
I never thought Kotani
could undergo such a transformation!

443
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,977
It's a miracle!

444
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,650
Cute! Totally cute!

445
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,620
Nobuko, you're pretty! Nobuko!

446
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,024
Holy cow!

447
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,327
Glug…

448
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,963
SWEET GOODNESS

449
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,364
That's awesome.

450
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,100
THIS IS SOYMILK!

451
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,371
Awesome!

452
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,646
-You know those clothes that Kotani wore?
-Yes?

453
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,549
They were a lot like
those clothes that I suggested.

454
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,551
-Really? Is that right?
-Yes.

455
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,921
I totally didn't notice.
You've got a good eye.

456
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,157
What's more,
those fundamentals I talked about,

457
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,393
she had them down to a tee
without missing a thing.

458
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:01,566
Kotani's got such great fashion sense,
why was she the way she was?

459
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,467
Right?

460
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,403
-Let's get <i>monjayaki</i>!
-Yes! Let's!

461
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,738
Let's go!

462
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,939
Shit…

463
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,341
-Your treat.
-You bet!

464
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,878
-You want rice cakes on it?
-Yes!

465
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,787
DANI

466
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,630
-Good morning.
-Morning.

467
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,565
Morning.

468
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,168
Can I wear ordinary clothes from tomorrow?

469
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,873
I guess you'll have to.

470
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:17,909
Morn…

471
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,881
Principal Iehara,
can I get your seal on these?

472
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:23,848
Okay.

473
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,853
-What is it?
-Can you wait a second?

474
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,323
What's this?

475
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,826
A picture of a raccoon dog?

476
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,062
That's not a raccoon dog.
That's Hello Kitty.

477
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,430
-You idiot.
-What?

478
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,965
What's going on?

479
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,502
How can you know that
if you didn't draw it?

480
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,671
I just thought that's what it looked like.

481
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,107
See that? She's wearing a ribbon.

482
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:53,278
We cannot authorize it
if you drew it yourselves!

483
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,982
-You've got to be kidding!
-You've got to be kidding!

484
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,517
Chie!

485
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,719
-We didn't get approval!
-We didn't get approval!

486
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,523
No way! I just painted on mine!

487
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,792
What will I tell my mom?

488
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,763
Let's get our parents help.
Get photos with our phones.

489
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,135
She drew it herself. "Proof"?

490
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,237
I don't have any.

491
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,605
Sorry.

492
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,540
Sorry. Bye.

493
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,842
A parent, right? What'd they say?

494
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,512
"It's unfair just one kid
gets to wear ordinary clothes."

495
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,214
Everyone in class is getting upset!

496
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:36,020
You let one person wear ordinary clothes,
but nobody else? That's just not right.

497
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,656
-Right?
-That's right!

498
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,792
Let us wear ordinary clothes too!

499
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,928
I can't wear this uniform!

500
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,302
Without even trying to understand
how the bullied person feels,

501
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,905
you're trying to take advantage of
what she got.

502
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,375
I won't stand for that kind of attitude.

503
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,745
How do you know
that Kotani didn't paint it herself?

504
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,313
That's right.

505
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,516
-You don't have proof.
-Yes! That's right!

506
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,719
Just looking at it. You can tell!

507
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,688
Isn't that just your personal view?

508
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,124
That's not scientific.

509
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,425
That's right.

510
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,630
At any rate, we cannot give approval
if you ruined your uniform yourself.

511
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,999
From now on,

512
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,036
you're deeply mistaken if you think
you can get away with tricks like that!

513
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,909
I'm not going to back down.

514
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,684
Quiet down now!

515
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,223
Kotani. What's wrong?

516
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,927
Well…

517
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,832
I…

518
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,971
I'll wear my uniform from tomorrow.

519
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,041
Is that really what you want?

520
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,048
Is everyone else fine with that?

521
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,120
Is this the fairness
that you're all clamoring for?

522
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,927
Well, since it is what Kotani wants,

523
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,465
we won't be approving
ordinary clothes for anyone.

524
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,402
Whoever painted on her uniform
must be very pleased right now.

525
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,086
Buta! What'll you do now?

526
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,823
It's okay.

527
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,558
What's okay?

528
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,129
I'll dress cool
like I did with ordinary clothes.

529
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,265
You know that's impossible.

530
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,736
That's right.
It says "ugly pig" all across the back.

531
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,643
What's that?

532
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,684
This boy is wearing the PE uniform
I wore in elementary school.

533
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:24,956
You're right.

534
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,057
TICK

535
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,959
Her name's been changed to "tick."

536
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,462
The bullying then was the worst.

537
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,397
I wanted…

538
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,835
to die.

539
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,054
-Tick!
-Tick!

540
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,592
-Give it here!
-Don't!

541
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,761
Tick! Tick!

542
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,463
Give it back!

543
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,135
Stop it!

544
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,169
The PE uniform I threw out
somehow ended up

545
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,773
worn by a boy in Africa.

546
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,242
What's more,
he's smiling while wearing it.

547
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,549
I bet

548
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,287
he'd be happy no matter what he wears.

549
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,659
He can live life happily.

550
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,663
Someone down there painted on her uniform.

551
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:54,639
"The culprit is among you!" Like that?

552
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,477
I don't think
I can stand for it to end like this.

553
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,147
You got another idea?

554
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,583
Hit me with it! Come on!

555
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,920
Morning.

556
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,789
Morning.

557
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,291
-Morning.
-Good morning.

558
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,525
Morning.

559
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,394
-Good morning.
-Morning.

560
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,067
Good morning.

561
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,136
Morning.

562
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,246
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

563
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,350
UGLY PIG

564
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,122
Okay.

565
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,164
Those guys are such idiots!

566
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,267
They really and truly are idiots!

567
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,809
SNOB

568
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,410
MORON

569
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,657
One, two, three, four.

570
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,461
Good morning.

571
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,274
Eight days a week, hello!

572
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,877
-What do you think?
-What's that?

573
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,313
-I'm going to start a fad.
-That'll never be a fad!

574
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,148
Morning!

575
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,485
-I'll turn it into a huge fad!
-Don't run in the hall!

576
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,587
Look! One idiot already copied me!

577
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,491
It's a fad. No doubt about it!

578
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,962
Good morning.

579
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,632
Good morning.

580
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,534
Morning.

581
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,738
Good morning.

582
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,540
Good morning.

583
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,611
Good morning.

584
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,450
Good morning.

585
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,952
Morning.

586
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,904
<i>I'm not sure why, but after that,</i>

587
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,841
<i>it became a huge fad at our school.</i>

588
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,879
-Whoa! That's really nice!
-Whoa! That's really nice!

589
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,883
-We're in sync. This must be destiny!
-We're in sync. This must be destiny!

590
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,654
-Uniforms are the best!
-Uniforms are the best!

591
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,757
Look! It's like Hermès.

592
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,327
I heard that
Yamagata Prefecture grows the most.

593
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,361
Seriously.

594
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,563
LOVESICK

595
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,498
MANABU SATO

596
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,468
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

597
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,718
Things have gone crazy, right?

598
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,924
What'll we do about this?

599
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,862
Leave them be.
They'll get sick of it soon.

600
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,739
<i>Like Catherine said,
the fad died out fast.</i>

601
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,244
-Here! Look at this.
-Mr. Hirayama.

602
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,646
That's not a fad anymore.

603
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,381
What? You're kidding!

604
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,617
No, I'm not kidding.

605
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,087
But two or three people
still wear this stuff, right?

606
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,889
Not a single person does.

607
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:08,926
Back to work then.

608
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:25,009
<i>My dad showed up to the parent-teacher
conference dressed like the mafia.</i>

609
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,085
Mr. Yokoyama, good…

610
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:40,891
Have a seat.

611
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,802
<i>Nobuta is still as sulky as ever.</i>

612
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,172
<i>She's practicing how to smile now.</i>

613
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,175
Hey, quit making
that disgusting face, Kotani.

614
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,512
And it's your fault
that everyone blamed us for all that.

615
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,481
Hey, Kotani. Apologize!

616
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,851
Apologize, you ugly pig!

617
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,486
Ugly pig!

618
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,055
We're just saying what's true!

619
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,491
Ugly pig!

620
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,531
You ugly pig. Say something!

621
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,967
SUMIDAGAWA HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL

622
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,171
The festival?

623
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,749
<i>I secretly sneered at people who want to
make memories at the school festival.</i>

624
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:39,950
NINE DAYS
UNTIL SUMIDAGAWA HIGH FESTIVAL

625
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,922
<i>But this year's festival was special.</i>

626
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,059
<i>It was a festival</i>

627
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,962
<i>where everything was special…</i>

628
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,233
<i>and hair-curling.</i>

629
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,602
Oh, nice. A haunted house.

630
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:42,840
<i>If Nobuta's a success at the festival,
everyone will see her differently.</i>

631
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,274
Make it couples only!

632
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,578
<i>Kotani's the type that holds a grudge.</i>

633
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:50,080
<i>What are you going to do,
producer Shuji Kiritani?</i>

634
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:56,019
