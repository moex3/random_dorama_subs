1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,175
Don't sleep there.

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:10,944
Hey!

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,279
Hurry up.

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,648
Hey, come on.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>My big brother.</i>

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,023
<i>My big brother is in high school.</i>

7
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,026
<i>At home,
he dresses sloppy and he's untidy.</i>

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,763
<i>But when he goes out,
he acts totally cool.</i>

9
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:34,667
<i>His character at home
is totally different than when he's not.</i>

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:39,372
<i>When he's with friends,
he's incredibly chill.</i>

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,942
No problem. Don't worry about it.

12
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,515
Let's go.

13
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,650
Then we told each other how we felt!

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,419
-You drank my tea, didn't you?
-No!

15
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:57,590
<i>But at home, he is unbelievably stingy.</i>

16
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,992
-I'm sorry!
-You did drink it!

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,127
Yes, I did! I did drink it!

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,497
<i>My brother wants people to like him.</i>

19
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,633
<i>I think that's all he thinks about.</i>

20
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,702
<i>But if my brother acts like that…</i>

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,471
"Will he

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,241
be able to grow up to be a proper adult?"

23
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,412
Hey!

24
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,047
Come on. Let's go.

25
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,282
Sleep in your room!

26
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,087
Shuji.

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,789
Are you a cow? Or a horse?

28
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,526
What the heck is he dreaming about?

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,357
Ours is the only class that hasn't
decided on a project for the festival.

30
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,126
What's your problem, you people?

31
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,894
Who's in charge of festival planning?

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,395
Isn't it Bando?

33
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,332
-That's right! It's Bando.
-Gosh, what a pain.

34
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,900
Oh, it's you, Bando?

35
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,703
Spend this time deciding what to do.

36
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,238
Get up here.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,340
-What a pain.
-The floor's all yours.

38
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,612
What do you want to do for the festival?

39
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:29,983
You guys say something.

40
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,419
We're already doing
a live show in the gym!

41
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,854
-All new material!
-All new material!

42
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,956
-We're in sync!
-We're in sync!

43
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,359
-This must be destiny!
-This must be destiny!

44
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,127
You guys are a pain.

45
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,730
-Doesn't anyone want to do anything?
-I know!

46
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,865
Let's invite a celebrity!

47
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,600
-Nice!
-Good idea!

48
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,536
Then we should invite Masaharu Fukuyama.

49
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,105
-No! Ken Matsudaira.
-I know! Akiko Yada!

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,341
Akiko Yada is the best! Don't forget her!

51
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,278
Hey! Cut the bullshit ideas!

52
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,514
Then you decide.

53
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,849
Fine!

54
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,522
Then I can decide for everyone, right?

55
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,424
-Go right ahead.
-Bando's choice!

56
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,458
Yes!

57
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,427
We'll do a haunted house.

58
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,397
Just a dark room
with Kotani standing inside.

59
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,567
Very realistic!

60
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,235
Starring, Nobuko Kotani.

61
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,637
Props, Nobuko Kotani.
Scenery, Nobuko Kotani.

62
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,006
And direction, Nobuko Kotani.

63
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,107
That settles it!

64
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,944
Don't be stupid!
One person can't do all that!

65
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,646
Then I assign Akira Kusano
to do the grunt work.

66
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,682
"Hey! Cut the bullshit ideas!"

67
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,585
And what are you going to do, Bando?

68
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,688
I'll just watch to make sure
Kusano and Kotani do their jobs.

69
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,624
That's all. Any objections?

70
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,625
Me.

71
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,730
Settled by majority vote.

72
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,733
-It's settled!
-It's settled!

73
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,269
Is that what you guys want?

74
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,571
Are you complaining about what we decided?

75
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,773
That's not what I mean.

76
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,242
You're good with it?

77
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,315
-Okay. That settles it.
-That settles it?

78
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,186
Okay. Time to take attendance. Aoi.

79
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,220
Here.

80
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,590
But you know, this could be our chance.

81
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,127
If Nobuta is a success at the festival,

82
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,563
everyone will see her differently.

83
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,634
But of all possible things,
this is a haunted house, man.

84
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,737
No way the two of you can pull it off.

85
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,672
It's not two. There are three of us.

86
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,040
If we're doing this…

87
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,510
then let's have fun.

88
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,444
That's right.

89
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,146
Let's have fun doing it.

90
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,749
How can you be so easygoing about this?

91
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,587
<i>If we blow it,
Nobuta will get bullied even more.</i>

92
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,391
<i>What are you going to do,
producer Shuji Kiritani?</i>

93
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,060
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

94
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,462
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

95
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,065
What's wrong?

96
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,199
Nothing.

97
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,360
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

98
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,065
Why are you watching this scary movie?

99
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,335
We're doing a haunted house
at the school festival.

100
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,037
Oh, nice. A haunted house.

101
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,274
That's freaking me out!

102
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,376
What's freaking you out? I don't get it.

103
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,649
The scariest haunted house in my life was

104
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,785
when this man was
just standing there in the dark,

105
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
dressed like a regular businessman.

106
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,924
He stood there drearily
with his back facing me.

107
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,125
That's creepy!

108
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,827
I couldn't see his face,

109
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,962
but since he didn't move an inch,
I thought,

110
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,566
"This is probably a mannequin!"

111
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,968
But I couldn't make myself get close!

112
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,103
That was seriously scary.

113
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,839
I like that!
We could make that with a mannequin.

114
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,008
And dangle <i>konnyaku</i>
and slap it against people's faces.

115
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,244
Right. <i>Konnyaku</i>. Write that down.

116
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,424
What are you doing for the festival,
Shuji?

117
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,525
What?

118
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,027
A haunted house.

119
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,162
A haunted house?

120
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,631
Really? Nice! That sounds like fun.

121
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,933
-Can I go?
-No, don't go.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,170
-How come? Why not?
-I'll be busy.

123
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,974
I won't tell anyone
you're a sloppy mess at home.

124
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,576
Don't you dare go.

125
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,211
-Why?
-Don't you dare!

126
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,416
There's a dumpling stand!

127
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,153
You're not going.

128
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,422
I'm home.

129
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,092
Mom isn't home yet?

130
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,493
No.

131
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,295
She said she'll buy croquettes.

132
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,234
You've got a festival, right?

133
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,303
Yes.

134
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,451
Hey, James!

135
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,920
Yip yip.

136
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,955
Help with the paper-mache.

137
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,390
We're helping.

138
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,425
-We're helping, right?
-Yes.

139
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,793
Yes, we're helping.

140
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,062
You're not helping at all!

141
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,735
Since they insist,
let's finish it up real quick.

142
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,471
Those two will never finish anyway.

143
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,139
-Real quick?
-A quick job!

144
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,807
-Why not?
-Let's do it!

145
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,310
Let's do this! Nice and quick!

146
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,245
A nice quick paper-mache job!

147
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,548
Hey, everyone!

148
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,686
All the girls in class A are running
a dumpling stand wearing kimonos.

149
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,687
-Kimonos?
-Kimonos?

150
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,621
Let me see!

151
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,822
Kimonos?

152
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,758
Is that Mariko Uehara?

153
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,193
Mariko Uehara?

154
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,295
-Shuji!
-What?

155
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,498
It's Mariko Uehara in a kimono!

156
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,967
That way!

157
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,169
Hurry it up!

158
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,771
I thought you were wearing a kimono.

159
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,575
Do you have time
on the day of the festival?

160
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,943
Let's walk around together.

161
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,378
I doubt I will.

162
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,046
You've got a little time, right?

163
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,148
I'll go around in my kimono.

164
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,783
-Your kimono?
-Yes.

165
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,552
A kimono sounds nice.

166
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,821
I bet you'll look great in it.

167
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,628
Shuji!

168
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,865
-Perfect timing!
-What is it?

169
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,635
We'll never finish making
the costumes in time.

170
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,904
-I'm the leader of the drama club.
-Yes?

171
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,172
-You're good with needles.
-You bet.

172
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,341
Please! I'm begging you!

173
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,576
No way! Never!

174
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,745
I just need a little help! Please!

175
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,114
My best friend! My bosom buddy! Please!

176
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,382
-I really--
-Fine!

177
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,617
-Thank you! These are the directions!
-Okay.

178
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,885
-Thank you! Sorry!
-Fine.

179
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,663
-Shuji!
-Shuji!

180
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,466
We're doing a fashion show
on the day of the festival.

181
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,101
We need someone to take photos.

182
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,703
I am seriously busy.

183
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,106
-But you're such a good photographer!
-Please!

184
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,410
Oh, fine. What about a camera?

185
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,245
-Bring yours.
-Yes.

186
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,179
Mine?

187
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,148
Of course. Every photographer does.

188
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,084
Okay. I'll take great photos.

189
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,352
-All right!
-All right!

190
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,853
-Thanks! Bye!
-Sure.

191
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,393
What a pain.

192
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,814
Kiritani! Come over here!

193
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,182
What?

194
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,551
You're a good singer, right?

195
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,319
-No.
-Join us.

196
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,855
-Let's make a trio.
-No, it's okay. Please. No!

197
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,523
Wait! Don't! Please!

198
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,104
What?

199
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,538
It's just you two?

200
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,375
Where's everyone else?

201
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,110
They all went home.

202
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,613
For real?

203
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,181
What are we supposed to do?

204
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,516
Can we even finish it?

205
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,818
Don't panic.

206
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,520
How can you be so calm?

207
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,623
When doing simple tasks like this,

208
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,660
you feel like a monk meditating.

209
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,462
So we'll just work together,
the three of us.

210
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,497
Yip yip.

211
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,866
Hold on.

212
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,834
That's all you've done in one day?

213
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,505
No! We started three days ago!

214
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,242
What? Three days…

215
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,246
So this angle is 30 degrees.

216
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,385
And the length of this is
the radius of the circle, so it's two.

217
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,488
This is two. Then…

218
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,369
Oh, no! My right hand!

219
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,204
Why did you write "celebration"?

220
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,940
You're supposed to write "cursed"!

221
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,952
Later!

222
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,956
See you. Make sure you watch it.

223
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,157
Sounds nice.

224
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,960
-You guys, you better watch it.
-I will.

225
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,269
Shuji!

226
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,971
Look. We've made lots of progress.

227
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,541
Now we just need the thing
with the head that falls off.

228
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,578
What's he doing here?

229
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,548
The frightening three-eyed dog. Woof!

230
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,185
Are you kidding?
You call that frightening?

231
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,989
I'll now plot small a vector
and small b vector.

232
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,457
Okay.

233
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,728
BC vector here and AO vector are equal.

234
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,731
Why's that? Because they're parallel.

235
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,580
You know what?

236
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,485
No matter what I do,
I never feel like it's much fun.

237
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,459
Things to me only seem fun
when I think about them later.

238
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,661
What do you mean?

239
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:21,333
When I play video games and stuff,
they're not fun when I'm playing.

240
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,105
But when I remember them
while I'm studying, I think it was fun.

241
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:35,247
We may not realize what's fun
until after it happens.

242
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,762
I wonder if we'll remember
a few years down the road.

243
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,231
Remember what?

244
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,635
The three of us making the mannequins
early in the morning,

245
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,305
or picking <i>susuki</i> grass
in the late afternoon.

246
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,643
I wonder if in a few years
we'll remember these things

247
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,345
and think they were fun.

248
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,827
45TH SUMIDAGAWA HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL

249
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,809
Pretty darn scary!

250
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,144
This turned out good! Right?

251
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,312
Right?

252
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,953
D…

253
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,923
Dad…

254
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,927
It looks like your dad?

255
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,197
Want to call it "Kotani Papa"?

256
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,099
Kotani Papa.

257
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,834
Papa.

258
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,272
When you said "Dad,"
did you mean your stepdad?

259
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,175
I mean,

260
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:15,147
you said your mom remarried,
but you can't call her new husband "Dad."

261
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,851
Dad!

262
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,422
Oh, sorry.

263
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,925
I married your mom,

264
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,962
but I'm not your dad.

265
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,632
Strikeout!

266
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,404
But I bet you think of him as "Dad,"
don't you?

267
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,405
Yip yip.

268
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,009
I don't think that's your business.

269
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,378
You think so?

270
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,813
Do you?

271
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,749
How come, Shuji?

272
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,919
Talk to me, Shuji!

273
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,508
2-B REALM

274
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,250
Delphine!

275
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,819
Nothing's changed.

276
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,989
You mean, you went to high school here?

277
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:30,956
Yes.

278
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,826
I wrote this graffiti.

279
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,727
HEY BABY, I'LL BECOME HIDEKICHI

280
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,029
"I'll become Hidekichi."

281
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,199
Who's Hidekichi?

282
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,101
Hideyoshi.

283
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,770
It's Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

284
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,008
I was depressingly stupid.

285
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,277
I thought it was pronounced "Hidekichi."

286
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,715
I came to carve it over again,
but I think I'll leave it.

287
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,616
Right?

288
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,851
Okay.

289
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,457
As a memory of when
I was colossally stupid,

290
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,094
I'll leave it as is.

291
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,298
Okay?

292
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,233
Yes.

293
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,336
Bye.

294
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,877
Why's the last thing you're making a mole?

295
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:25,878
It's a bat.

296
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,480
Say, did you know?

297
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,484
Mole's live all alone in their hole.

298
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,656
But when it's time to mate,
they find themselves a mate. Perverts!

299
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,824
How?

300
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:44,163
When it's digging, it finds a woman,
they hug and get it on!

301
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,900
The odds of that must be pretty darn low.

302
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,102
Yes. It's all underground.

303
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,972
But if they do actually meet up,

304
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,009
that's a real miracle, right?

305
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,510
Yes. A miracle!

306
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,713
Yes! It's done!

307
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,518
Okay, a photo for the memories.

308
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,620
Let's go.

309
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,655
Good idea.

310
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,956
Okay.

311
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,162
Say "cheese."

312
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,968
-Hey.
-What?

313
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,269
Eats!

314
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,772
-Not going.
-Then how about food?

315
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,142
Bad joke. No good.

316
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,562
KOTANI HOUSE OF HORROR

317
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,380
-It's about to start!
-It's starting!

318
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,616
-What we've all been waiting for!
-It's coming soon now!

319
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,952
-We've all been waiting!
-It's the Sumidagawa High Festival!

320
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,788
-The opening!
-The opening!

321
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,633
Shuji!

322
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,301
-Shuji!
-What is it?

323
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,677
Shuji…

324
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,979
What the heck is this?

325
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,214
KOTANI

326
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,753
That Kotani says she'll still do it.

327
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,190
Kotani's the type that holds a grudge.

328
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,325
Whoever did it better say their prayers.

329
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,127
What? Wasn't it you who did it?

330
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,428
We wouldn't do this.

331
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,298
-We wouldn't go to this trouble.
-We sure wouldn't.

332
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,600
-Let's go.
-Yes.

333
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,937
We've got to
get ready for the fashion show!

334
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,806
-I'm sorry, Kotani!
-I'm sorry! Let's go.

335
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,178
Today's main event is about to start.
See you there.

336
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,970
I'm in shock!

337
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,077
Anyway, I'll hire some people
to fix what we can fix.

338
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,680
I'll be back
as soon as I'm done with my stuff.

339
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,415
You two will be fine until then, right?

340
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,853
Smile, would you?

341
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,622
Okay?

342
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,924
I'll be back in a sec.
Handle things till then.

343
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,565
SUMIDAGAWA HIGH SCHOOL

344
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,772
Excuse me.

345
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,507
Want some work?

346
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,942
-Work?
-What kind?

347
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,110
Well…

348
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,813
It's a really fun job. Really fun!

349
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,218
Keep this secret just between us.
Don't tell anyone.

350
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,321
You'll get the best experience
of this festival.

351
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,023
-Experience?
-The best experience!

352
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,859
You can't get this experience
anywhere else!

353
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,428
Whoa! Thanks man!

354
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,130
You'll be in it as well.

355
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,665
What? In the play?

356
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,500
-Your lines are easy.
-No way!

357
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,101
"There's a fight!" That's all.

358
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,836
-I can't!
-2 p.m. on the dot. Okay?

359
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,738
-Later!
-Wait! Yoshida!

360
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,707
-Wait a minute!
-Nice timing.

361
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,375
-Let's tune up.
-Wait!

362
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,311
-Let's go!
-Wait!

363
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,984
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

364
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,387
-There. Next!
-Next!

365
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,522
Let's get this.

366
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,025
You guys are on fire! You're hot!

367
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,195
That's right.
You got to have passion for a festival.

368
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,397
We won't have this chance later in life.

369
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,132
I guess you're right.

370
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,300
Let's do this!

371
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,468
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

372
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,237
Okay. The tombstones are ready.

373
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,708
Looks like we'll be ready by lunch.

374
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,349
Someone you know?

375
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,618
Your stepdad that you talked about?

376
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,762
I happened to be nearby.

377
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,066
If you've got time,
want to get something to eat?

378
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,703
I didn't have breakfast, so I'm starving.

379
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,038
I'm not hungry.

380
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,606
Oh, I see.

381
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,014
Hello?

382
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,850
It's nice to hear from you.

383
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,485
Yes? Okay.

384
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,919
What?

385
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,923
Oh, certainly!
I'll be right there. Goodbye.

386
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,930
Sorry. I've got to get back to work.

387
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,134
Here.

388
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,938
I didn't know what to get.

389
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,008
-Share this with everyone.
-Thank you.

390
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,979
Okay. Have a good time.

391
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,155
After what you told me,

392
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,257
I thought he'd be a jerk.

393
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,392
But he's a totally cool dad.

394
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,962
But why sweet buns?

395
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,766
Those are my favorite sweets.

396
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,003
He really is a cool dad.

397
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,705
I'm hungry.

398
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,543
Why don't we get some lunch? Okay?

399
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,710
Okay?

400
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,646
Okay?

401
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,119
Okay.

Thank you.

Bye.

00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,700
Go ahead.

Is that right?

428
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,486
I must have a hard heart.

429
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,455
No, you don't.

430
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,790
You said it yourself.

431
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,160
It takes time
before realizing something is fun.

432
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,529
This is the same.

433
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:15,200
This kind of thing takes time too.

434
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,274
Shuji!

435
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,545
-I'll tell them I'm stepping out.
-Okay.

436
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,480
-Hold on a second.
-Okay.

437
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,481
I'll wait.

438
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,356
Sorry! I was really busy.

439
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,291
You're late, Shuji!

440
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,027
You've done a great job!

441
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,329
But absolutely nobody's coming!

442
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,166
I guess we got kind of a late start.

443
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,600
Become a closer couple!

444
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,436
Congratulations!

445
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,438
Become a closer couple!

446
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,241
Make it couples only!

447
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,810
We'll get even fewer people!

448
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,914
If you limit it, then everybody wants it!
Even allow boy couples and girl couples!

449
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,182
Dang!

450
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,217
Couples only!

451
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,286
A couples-only haunted house!

452
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,821
That couple!

453
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,656
Look! A couple!

454
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,325
Come on, everyone! Couples!

455
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,864
Then can I change the ending a little?

456
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,101
You bet! Make it even more exciting!
I'll be back!

457
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,870
Couples! Come on couples!

458
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,039
Sorry!

459
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,640
I was waiting.

460
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,609
-Let's go.
-Okay.

461
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,345
Where do you want to go first?

462
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,913
Shuji?

463
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,318
Stop!

464
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,522
-I told you not to come!
-Shuji? What?

465
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,390
Sorry!

466
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,059
Wait! Shuji!

467
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,896
You're not supposed to come
without a guardian!

468
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,197
You're here, Shuji.

469
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,066
I told you, I'm busy.

470
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,301
There he is! The peasant!

471
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,706
-What?
-You promised to play a peasant!

472
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,508
What? I'm a peasant?

473
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,009
One peasant captured!

474
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,445
-No way!
-Get changed or we'll be late!

475
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,479
Take him away!

476
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,248
-Take him away!
-You go home now!

477
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,916
Go home, you!

478
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,120
Step right up for the haunted house!

479
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,289
There's a long wait,

480
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,025
so if it's your second time,
come back later!

481
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,594
Incidentally, I am Dracula!

482
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,697
Hey, it's your guys' second time! Out!

483
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,435
We're in the same class. Let us go in.

484
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,537
Yes.

485
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,572
No! Back of the line!

486
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,251
Ms. Kuroki is in line with her boyfriend!

487
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,359
Go away!

488
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,028
Hurry up and kill them!

489
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,164
You tramp! Just because I was nice,
don't take advantage of me!

490
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,699
-Out of the way!
-There's a fight!

491
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,967
There's a fight!

492
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,503
I'm really sorry.

493
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,371
Let's go to the haunted house.

494
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,473
What? You mean our haunted house?

495
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,643
Yes. I heard the end is really moving.

496
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,213
-It's moving? A haunted house?
-So I heard.

497
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,949
-Fashion show! You're up next!
-Okay.

498
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,050
This way, please.

499
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,986
Oh, crap. I totally forgot.

500
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,855
Shuji!

501
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,456
Get good photos!

502
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,525
I'll hate you forever if they're blurry.

503
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,861
Okay. They won't be blurry.

504
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,731
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

505
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,100
-Sorry.
-Shuji! Wait!

506
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,535
Shuji!

507
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,776
Camera!

508
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:19,777
Camera!

509
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,882
Excuse me. I'll take that.

510
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,920
Oh, right. I'm a peasant now.

511
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,158
I'll bring you the money later.
I swear I'll bring it!

512
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,927
Please.

513
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,005
Excuse me!

514
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,640
-Where's 2-B?
-That way.

515
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,841
<i>KONNYAKU</i>

516
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,109
Use these.

517
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,112
We've got <i>konnyaku</i>!

518
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,414
When I heard
the haunted house got destroyed,

519
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,683
I did what little I could
and hustled over.

520
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,985
But…

521
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,288
it doesn't look destroyed.

522
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,089
We've already fixed it.

523
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,724
I see.

524
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,194
Guess I'm too late and lost my chance.

525
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,462
What's this?

526
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:16,034
Well, I was thinking
I could post this off to the side.

527
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,102
You're late because you drew that,
aren't you?

528
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,003
Stab.

529
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,240
Well… Actually, you're right.

530
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,578
What? What's that?

531
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,179
You know, that was really nice.

532
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,415
-That was really moving.
-Yes, it really was.

533
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,252
-What's so moving about a haunted house?
-I heard the ending is pretty cool.

534
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,454
-Right?
-Yes.

535
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,089
-Let's go in.
-I want to go too!

536
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,891
-I want to go too!
-I want to go!

537
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,526
If you want to go, then go.

538
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,328
-Yes! Let's go!
-Let's go!

539
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,135
-Dang! That's what youth is all about.
-I was really moved!

540
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,670
Yes, very moved…

541
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,838
Sorry.

542
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,073
Quit shouting, you geezer!

543
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,977
Listen. Even us geezers
want to shout sometimes.

544
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,479
Fuck off, you bald geezer!

545
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,084
My hair's just very short.

546
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,319
Ouch!

547
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,789
It's almost time for the ending!

548
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,058
Wait! What about our live show?

549
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,292
We ran out of time.

550
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,929
-What? All is lost!
-Watch out!

551
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,633
CLOSED

552
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,672
We're done, at last.

553
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,610
Oh, you guys are all done too?

554
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,813
It's all thanks to the guys you hired.

555
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,716
You all have been a big help. Thanks.

556
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,619
Like you said, it was fun. Right?

557
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,021
I'm really glad we met you guys.

558
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,191
We may never meet again though.

559
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,325
Oh, well.

560
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,529
Guess we got to go back
to our lives again.

561
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,833
That's a nice camera. Right?

562
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,734
Take a photo.

563
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,069
Sure.

564
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,970
Okay.

565
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,207
Stand up.

566
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,112
-Crouch lower.
-Okay.

567
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,313
More.

568
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,517
There.

569
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,889
Five. Four. Three.

570
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,402
Let's see it.

571
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,397
You guys!

572
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,969
It's Catherine!

573
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,510
I see.

574
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,712
This year,

575
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,882
those guys came again.

576
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,391
Principal Iehara here. I'm coming in.

577
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,393
You saw them, didn't you?

578
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,594
You saw them?

579
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,632
They were our students 20 years ago.

580
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,033
Twenty years ago?

581
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,935
Their uniforms were brown, right?

582
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,572
Did they say they were Yamamoto,
Komai, and Kaneko?

583
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,474
Yes, they did.

584
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,309
I knew it!

585
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,944
When it's festival time…

586
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,048
Those guys show up every year.

587
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,684
Are they ghosts?

588
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,152
No. They're alive.

589
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,687
They're alive?

590
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:34,592
I think Komai is a neurosurgeon
at a university hospital.

591
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,696
Yes. Yamamoto is a magazine editor
at a publishing company.

592
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,531
Kaneko's a supermarket manager.

593
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,100
But they were all high school students.

594
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,370
That's because they're living spirits.

595
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,306
Living spirits?

596
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,810
They're way too busy with work,
so there's no way they can come.

597
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,981
They must have really loved
their high school festival.

598
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,016
It is only once in a lifetime

599
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,721
when you can be with friends
and become engrossed in meaningless fun.

600
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,801
<i>They can't forget that, so every year,</i>

601
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,171
<i>they come here in just spirit alone.</i>

602
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,373
THIRD YEAR, CLASS A

603
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,541
Those guys…

604
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,697
Koji!

605
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,299
You didn't go home?

606
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,668
Come with me!

607
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,603
I wanted to see the haunted house!

608
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,605
Then you should have seen it
and gone home!

609
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,975
But it was couples only.

610
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,045
Oh, right.

611
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,547
Then let's go in.

612
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,449
-Yes!
-Okay.

613
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,457
You go first, Koji.

614
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,126
-What?
-Yes. Hurry up.

615
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,761
-Oh, man!
-Hurry!

616
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,230
Hold on a second.

617
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,333
You go first.

618
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,170
I think it's looking at us.

619
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,679
Okay.

620
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,147
Thank goodness.

621
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,817
-Don't push me.
-But I'm afraid something's behind me.

622
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,061
That scared me!

623
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,228
Splat!

624
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,764
That's disgusting! Darn you!

625
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,800
Cut that out!

626
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,111
This must be it.

627
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,086
It opened.

628
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,624
There's someone!

629
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,093
It's just a mirror.

630
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,163
Something's written on it.

631
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,902
"The chances of you meeting
the person you are holding hands with now

632
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,338
were far greater than one in a million.

633
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,010
Once you're out in the light,
make sure you don't let go of their hand."

634
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:46,751
Let's go.

635
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,252
Yes.

636
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,402
Did you have fun?

637
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,370
Yes. That was fun.

638
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,438
Right?

639
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,374
Yes! Whoever made this is a genius!

640
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,843
-I'm a genius!
-A genius! Yay!

641
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,245
-Let's go again!
-Genius!

642
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,846
Hurry! Come on!

643
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,148
Hurry!

644
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,883
One more time!

645
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,653
You've got a date with Shuji
after this, right?

646
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,089
-Well, yes.
-I'm so envious.

647
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,391
I'd like to fall in love too.

648
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,064
That was a nice festival.

649
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,034
The students only have it three times,

650
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,437
but we've done these dozens of times.

651
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,806
How many times for you?

652
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,375
That's my 800th.

653
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,920
It's over! It's finally over!

654
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,423
That was one long day.

655
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,360
It was long for me too.

656
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,662
What?

657
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,032
You see…

658
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,136
For the longest time, I was digging alone,

659
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,873
like a mole in the dirt.

660
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,177
Then suddenly, two people showed up.

661
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,579
What?

662
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,648
"Two people"? You mean us two?

663
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,150
Yes.

664
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,887
From now on,

665
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,958
I wonder if we'll just happen
to meet people again like this.

666
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,394
If we do,

667
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,800
then it's probably all right to be
digging in the dirt by myself, right?

668
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,137
We probably will meet

669
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,207
all kinds of people.

670
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,312
Then someday

671
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,716
we'll never meet again.

672
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,906
-Koji.
-Yes?

673
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,340
Don't you be like me.

674
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,643
Like what?

675
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,044
Well…

676
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,047
I mean, don't become an adult

677
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:33,250
who's only good at getting by
but can't ever build anything.

678
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,086
<i>I was shocked by it.</i>

679
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,858
<i>When I saw that Nobuta
and Akira, who I thought was stupid,</i>

680
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,495
<i>had made something that worked so well,</i>

681
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,598
<i>I was totally shocked.</i>

682
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,868
You're a great guy, Shuji.

683
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,470
What?

684
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,206
You always keep your promises.

685
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,910
You can be a little bit
of a poser sometimes though.

686
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,079
But I think you're a nice guy.

687
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,718
Oh, Dad's home.

688
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:08,686
Yes.

689
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,120
Let's go.

690
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,325
<i>Tomorrow,
the classroom will be like it was before.</i>

691
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,462
<i>Nobuta will be bullied again.</i>

692
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,932
<i>Akira will be a nuisance
like he always is.</i>

693
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,502
<i>And I'll be the popular guy.</i>

694
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,075
<i>Though there's no way
that could ever change…</i>

695
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,147
<i>I was really insecure.</i>

696
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,152
<i>I've got nothing…</i>

697
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,324
<i>so I was incredibly insecure.</i>

698
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,625
<i>Whoa! This sight will blow your mind!</i>

699
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,327
Are you guys dating?

700
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,630
-You should tell Nobuta that you love her.
-What?

701
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:34,531
Shuji, don't you know?

702
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:41,004
