1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,476
-Morning, Shuji.
-Morning!

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,144
-Let's go in together.
-Yes!

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,179
Yes!

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,716
-What's today's bento?
-Today's is…

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,453
<i>Every darn one of them is watching us.</i>

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,855
<i>It only makes sense.</i>

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,026
<i>In anyone's eyes, we're the ideal couple.</i>

8
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>But I have no intention
of dating her properly.</i>

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:35,402
<i>Doing that kind of thing
during this short time in high school is</i>

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,737
<i>just way too stupid.</i>

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,539
It's almost November 4.

12
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,242
What? Oh, you mean 114.

13
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,143
THREE DAYS UNTIL 114.
ZERO SIGN-UPS.

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,711
114 DAY

15
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,513
-Shuji!
-Whoa!

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,648
-Okay. Let's do this!
-Okay!

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,483
-There!
-There!

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,885
The lord has arrived!

19
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,887
-Our lord!
-Our lord!

20
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,223
Milord, Takashi James Yamada
knows not what 114 day is!

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,926
-What?
-What do you do on 114?

22
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,661
You don't know it, James?

23
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,331
Well, you see,
114 is an event at our school.

24
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,535
On this day, you can confess your love
to the person you like.

25
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,272
"I love you! Will you be my girlfriend?"

26
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,211
And a good day for confessing
your love like that is November 4.

27
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:23,349
"114" sounds like, "Yes, I will,"
which is the answer you want.

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,284
That's right.

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,286
However!

30
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,221
Each year, it's limited to…

31
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,390
-One person.
-One person?

32
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,225
Then even I can do it?

33
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,930
How come?

34
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:42,168
-I wouldn't do that if I were zoo!
-I wouldn't do that if I were zoo!

35
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,603
-Our gags are in sync!
-Our gags are in sync!

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,472
-This must be destiny!
-This must be destiny!

37
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,372
End of show!

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,340
But how come?

39
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,343
It's fine if they say, "I like you too!"

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,611
I love you!

41
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>If you're showered with flowers
and everyone shouts "Nice couple,"</i>

42
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,718
<i>it'll be your best memory of high school.</i>

43
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:03,990
But if you're rejected,
a bucket of water is dumped on you…

44
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,925
-Splash!
-Splash!

45
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,160
Reminds me of last year.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,196
Tezuka's utter destruction.

47
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>He went for that senior
that looked like Meg Ryan.</i>

48
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,267
-I love you.
-I'm sorry.

49
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,708
After that, he became an insect freak.

50
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,810
Morning.

51
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,212
Yip yip!

52
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,847
Are you guys dating?

53
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,284
How disgusting! World's worst couple.

54
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,287
Why don't you confess your love on 114?

55
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,990
-Yuck!
-Gross! You're grossing me out!

56
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,458
Gross!

57
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,193
<i>That 114 stuff is bullshit.</i>

58
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,263
<i>Talk about lame crap.</i>

59
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,330
Here.

60
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,699
What's this?

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,104
The Nobuta Production Project notebook.

62
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,074
What? Why do I have to have one
that's just like yours?

63
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,609
Matching with different colors.

64
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,411
They're all the same color.

65
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,480
What's this?

66
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,783
"114 Love Project"?

67
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,522
On 114, if Shuji confesses his love
for Nobuta in front of everyone,

68
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,592
you'll become popular in an instant.

69
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,129
How come you guys never thought of
such an easy thing before?

70
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,363
Are you insane?

71
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,966
Why do I have to do that?

72
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,768
What are you so mad about?

73
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,203
Not getting enough calcium?

74
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,906
You don't get it, do you? Listen.

75
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:31,644
There's no point if you don't
become popular by your own efforts. Okay?

76
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,015
That's what you say, but I bet
you're just afraid you'll lose popularity.

77
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,617
Are you actually a petty guy?

78
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,018
Shuji's pathetic!

79
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,720
No, that's not it!

80
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,222
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

81
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,391
<i>I have absolutely no intention of</i>

82
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,795
<i>losing popularity to make Nobuta popular.</i>

83
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,697
<i>Make Nobuta my girlfriend?</i>

84
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:56,669
<i>If I did that, my image
that I've worked so hard to build would…</i>

85
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,506
So, you see,

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,011
doing that kind of thing
ultimately wouldn't benefit Nobuta.

87
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,347
It wouldn't benefit her?

88
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,084
That's right. We're doing this for her.

89
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,188
<i>I am a hypocrite.</i>

90
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,446
Me?

91
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,816
-You don't want to?
-No. That's not it.

92
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,686
But, you know,

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,257
making a confession of love
in front of everyone… That's kind of…

94
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,993
But everyone will celebrate us!

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,665
I heard rumors that all the couples
from that day end up unhappy.

96
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,467
I've never heard that.

97
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,002
Remember those seniors?

98
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,706
<i>They can't let anyone see them break up,
so they're like a loveless couple.</i>

99
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,911
Then I'll confess my love.

100
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,012
To whom?

101
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,881
To you, of course!

102
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,717
I might get water dumped on me though.

103
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,485
I'd do that to you?

104
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,888
No way! Never!

105
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,692
But without this kind of opportunity,
I can't tell how you really feel about me.

106
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,826
Really?

107
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,162
You won't even tell me your birthday.

108
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:35,468
Well, you see, if you knew my birthday,
you'd try to do all kinds of stuff for me.

109
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,540
I mean, love is all about keeping secrets.

110
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,943
Okay? And my secret is…

111
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,180
you.

112
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,948
Okay?

113
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,550
What's that supposed to mean?

114
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,786
Love sure is nice, isn't it?

115
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,621
-It sure is.
-Yes.

116
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,560
All that "love" crap is such BS.
How stupid.

117
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,733
Nobuta,
your previous incarnation was a stone!

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,168
A stone?

119
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,970
That's "D" rank.

120
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,640
Shuji.

121
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,909
Shuji.

122
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,579
Shuji! Shuji Kiritani!

123
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,281
I'll tell you what your
previous incarnation was,

124
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,150
-so tell me your birthday.
-What?

125
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,953
I never tell anyone my birthday.

126
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,087
Why?

127
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,758
Because I hate having it celebrated
when I don't want it.

128
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,795
And I hate being forced to
eat cake and stuff.

129
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,897
There are people who hate that?

130
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,901
I mean, what do you do
when you get a present you don't want?

131
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,972
"Oh, I've always wanted this!
Thank you so much!"

132
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,208
Saying that is such a pain.
It's exhausting and annoys me.

133
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,712
-Tell me. I won't give you any presents.
-No.

134
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,515
If you don't tell me,
I'll give you a present every day.

135
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,750
No! I'm not telling you!

136
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,119
-Tell me!
-Oh, cut it out, would you?

137
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,155
-What's wrong? Stressed out?
-No.

138
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,122
When is it?

139
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,327
-Fine… November…
-Yes?

140
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,062
First.

141
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,063
11-1.

142
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,966
That's today.

143
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,235
You're right! It is!

144
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,571
Shut up!

145
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,540
That's why I didn't want to tell you.

146
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,243
Don't you dare say, "Let's celebrate."

147
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,084
I've got it! Your previous incarnation…

148
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,720
A strong man!

149
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,924
A stone and a strong man.

150
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,492
I knew it.

151
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,127
The best couple ever!

152
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,165
-Excuse me.
-No problem.

153
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,168
Oh, you're early today, Mr. Saotome.

154
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,536
Greetings.

155
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,405
Greetings.

156
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,373
-You know what?
-What?

157
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,477
There was a beautiful lady
in a kimono at the entrance just now!

158
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,012
-You think it's the principal's daughter?
-No.

159
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,781
I wonder who it is.

160
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,916
What?

161
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,955
I smell the scent of sweet olive.

162
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,430
The woman in that kimono is
meeting me for a marriage interview.

163
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,999
No way!

164
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,069
You're doing a marriage interview?

165
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,738
That's so unfair!

166
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,742
"Thus the man did embark the capital"

167
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,877
"Did embark for the capital."

168
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,212
"Did embark for the capital."

169
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,116
"Alas, he lamented departing his beloved.

170
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,787
After remaining apart for three years,

171
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,625
his beloved had grown tired

172
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,896
of awaiting his return."

173
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,230
Whoa! Look at that!

174
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,932
This sight will blow your mind!

175
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,768
-Get over here! Come on!
-Cut that out!

176
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:56,969
We're in the middle of class!

177
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:05,378
"I must say, I am very fond of you."

178
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,483
"I am devilishly fond of you!"

179
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,555
"I have five million…
five million yen in savings!"

180
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,091
"How delightful!"

181
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,193
What? Wait!

182
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,096
-Something's wrong!
-What? Really?

183
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,333
The woman got angry and ran off!

184
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,403
Hallelujah!

185
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,073
-No way!
-No way!

186
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,108
Oh, no! What'll he do?

187
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,278
Tani! Investigate, please.

188
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,461
You dropped your notebook.

189
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,434
NOVEMBER 1: SHUJI KIRITANI'S BIRTHDAY

190
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,804
Thank you.

191
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,286
<i>Didn't you say
you don't tell anyone your birthday?</i>

192
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,854
Yes, I said that.

193
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,358
Your birthday was
written in Kotani's notebook!

194
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,563
Oh, that.

195
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,965
What? You saw that?

196
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,668
Just by accident.

197
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,603
It fell on the floor

198
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,439
and it just happened to be
open to that page.

199
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,209
Oh, that's what it was?

200
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,946
That? You mean this. Right?

201
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,882
This was it.

202
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:55,988
I must have dropped it,
then Kotani found it and brought it to me.

203
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,093
Oh, so this was your notebook.

204
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,595
That's right.

205
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,430
Sorry.

206
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,802
So you write your own birthday
in your own notebook?

207
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,440
No. Actually,
it was my brother who wrote it.

208
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,009
Come to think of it,
it wasn't your handwriting.

209
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,579
You could tell that just at a glance?

210
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,514
Yes.

211
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,684
That's scary.

212
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,719
<i>Sticky situation</i>

213
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,254
<i>Sticky situation</i>

214
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,423
<i>Sticky situation</i>

215
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,625
<i>Sticky situation</i>

216
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,096
<i>Sticky situation</i>

217
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,031
Sorry.

218
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,641
Damn. I'm a good liar.

219
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,185
Hi.

220
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,554
And apparently,

221
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,658
the lady asked him, "Who would be
more important to you, me or your mother?"

222
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,059
What did Sebastian say?

223
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,494
"My mother."

224
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,830
His mother?

225
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,599
-Told you he was a mama's boy!
-What a moron!

226
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,068
Doesn't he know you lie
in those situations?

227
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,403
That's for sure!

228
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,605
Sebastian is such an idiot!

229
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,006
"Mother!"

230
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,775
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,680
Why are you apologizing?

232
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,418
Good point.

233
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,290
Is that really such a bad thing?

234
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,425
Excuse me?

235
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,462
Long ago,

236
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,168
I was always getting in trouble,
but my mom never gave up on me.

237
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,875
Is it such a bad thing
to love a mother like that?

238
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,844
No.

239
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,814
Is it such a stupid thing

240
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,618
to not be able to lie to a woman?

241
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,287
No.

242
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,657
I will never think so.

243
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,560
Good.

244
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,599
I will never, ever think so.

245
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,344
I can smell sweet olive.

246
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,251
No doubt about it,
the aroma of heartbreak.

247
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,865
What will you use that for?

248
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,469
Since it's his birthday,
I still want to do something for him.

249
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,405
He said he doesn't like that.

250
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,341
I don't think forcing it is a good idea.

251
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,644
That's why I'll make something
that won't last.

252
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,348
What the hell did you say?

253
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,352
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

254
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,321
-You called me one first!
-Shut your trap!

255
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,089
Ouch! Why do you do that?

256
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,525
You always end up hitting me!

257
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,694
Can't you talk instead?
You must be a moron.

258
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,095
What the fuck did you just say?

259
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,002
Don't you go do that kind of thing.
It's going to be on your record.

260
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,537
Give me your name and address.

261
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,038
Who the fuck are you?

262
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,607
Stay out of this, Kusano.

263
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,712
Every woman's heart is made out of glass.

264
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,382
So don't you dare ever hit a woman.

265
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,821
You've got it all wrong!
He's my boyfriend!

266
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,122
Is that so?

267
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,624
That's right!

268
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,461
If she's the person you should be
treating the best in the world,

269
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,264
why are you hitting her?

270
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,367
Yip!

271
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,702
Who the fuck is this freak?

272
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,439
What are you looking at?

273
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,276
Butt out of my business, Kusano!

274
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,446
"Butt out of my business, Kusano!"

275
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,384
Bicycle.

276
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,219
Bye-bicycle!

277
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,620
-Ciao!
-Ciao!

278
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,090
Thank goodness. I made it in time.

279
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,793
There's something that I want to show you.

280
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,694
Okay.

281
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,673
Yip yip!

282
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,007
-Can I?
-Sure.

283
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:42,942
Here goes.

284
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,478
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

285
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,015
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

286
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,052
Sorry.
I threw it together with just what we had.

287
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,653
It still looks great.

288
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,821
-It does?
-Yes.

289
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,057
-Then let's eat.
-Hold on!

290
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,827
It would be a waste to eat it now.
Can I take it home like this?

291
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,729
-Sure.
-Can I?

292
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,332
I'm so happy! Seriously!

293
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,232
Wow!

294
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,069
I'm the happiest guy in the world.

295
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,547
Where did this cake come from?

296
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,848
That?

297
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,150
Mariko gave it to me.

298
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,754
Aren't you having any?

299
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,824
Actually, I can't stand cake.

300
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,893
In fact, whipped cream is the worst.

301
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,298
Ouch.

302
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,073
You have to eat this.

303
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,909
-What?
-She put her heart into it.

304
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,945
Don't worry.

305
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,981
I already showed her
that I was really happy.

306
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,419
But you have to eat it.

307
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,057
That's the kind of stubborn thinking
you need to change.

308
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,727
This kind of lie is okay. She's happy.

309
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,498
And I don't have to eat what I don't like.
Everybody's happy.

310
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,302
But she put her heart into this.

311
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,241
All that stuff about hearts
is just creepy.

312
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,312
In fact,
it's about time you learned to lie.

313
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,550
That's probably
one of the reasons you get bullied.

314
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,420
What does heart even mean?

315
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,855
It's so lame.

316
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,301
What's her problem?

317
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,105
Well…

318
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:01,747
Since it's your birthday, Nobuta insisted
on doing something for you.

319
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,585
Didn't I tell you
not to do that kind of stuff?

320
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,653
Didn't I?

321
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,055
It's not much,

322
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,794
but this is from our heart to you.

323
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,097
Yip!

324
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:40,219
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

325
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,857
Why'd you…

326
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,141
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

327
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,482
Tell me the truth!

328
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:11,917
Tell me!

329
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,852
Tell me the truth!

330
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,056
<i>Love and courage are my only friends</i>

331
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,758
I saw him!

332
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,762
What's wrong, Mr. Hirayama?

333
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,466
I saw… the Truth Man!

334
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,001
Who's the "Truth Man"?

335
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,170
What? You don't know?

336
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,174
He says, "Tell me the truth!"

337
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,109
And runs after you!

338
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,945
If you don't tell him,
he won't stop following you!

339
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,715
-All right!
-Tell me the truth!

340
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,418
All right! I'll tell you the truth.

341
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,488
I've wanted to hit it rich
with a new product

342
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,057
and build my own company office.

343
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,159
I know that's arrogant!

344
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,663
And I also thought I'd like to
own a toy poodle.

345
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,797
I'm sorry!

346
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,566
<i>If you lie to Truth Man,</i>

347
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,935
they say something awful will happen!

348
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,069
Like what?

349
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,071
Like this

350
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,173
or that…

351
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,144
That's scary!

352
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,946
-No!
-Ouch!

353
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,944
-Wow!
-Did you see this?

354
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,980
Whoa! This is bad!

355
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:48,947
Hey! Shuji!

356
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,383
What? What is it? What's going on?

357
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,252
-Come on!
-What is it? What is it?

358
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,288
What is it? What is it?

359
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,725
When was this made?

360
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,626
SHUJI + NOBUKO

361
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:04,663
Morning yogurt is good for the tummy!

362
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,098
Looks like something came out.

363
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,100
Man…

364
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,002
Not our class again?

365
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,475
-Good idea!
-Good idea!

366
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,845
Do you even think that's possible?

367
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,481
-It's totally possible.
-It sure is!

368
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,749
There it goes!

369
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,085
-Okay, let's go!
-Let's go!

370
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,220
TWO DAYS UNTIL 114.

371
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,088
ZERO SIGN-UPS.

372
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,692
Hey!

373
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,361
Somebody signed up for 114!

374
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,729
-Who? A sophomore?
-Who?

375
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,897
Someone in our class!

376
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,432
And it's a girl!

377
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,167
-A girl?
-Really?

378
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,502
Which girl is it?

379
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,936
Quiet down!

380
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,639
Quiet down, would you? Quiet down!

381
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,374
Let's listen to what Tani has to say.

382
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,109
-Come on.
-All right.

383
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,912
This year, Kotani is doing it.

384
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,247
-Kotani?
-What?

385
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,818
Who are you confessing your love to?

386
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,286
Who?

387
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,355
Yes. Who are you doing it to?

388
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,891
You know what? It's Shuji!

389
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,460
Me?

390
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,266
Shuji!

391
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,638
Special edition!

392
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,473
We got the scoop on 114!

393
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,508
A miracle will happen on November 4!

394
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,609
That day…

395
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,578
-Mariko!
-What?

396
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,687
Shuji!

397
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,089
-Shuji!
-Shuji!

398
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,523
What will you do?

399
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,425
Will you trade Mariko Uehara for Kotani?

400
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,461
-What? Of course not!
-That figures!

401
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,096
Aren't you a little tempted?

402
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,864
-Even a little?
-Not tempted at all!

403
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,599
-Why would I be?
-I'm sorry.

404
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,067
Can I ask some questions?

405
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,936
TWO DAYS UNTIL 114

406
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,142
Getting water dumped on you

407
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,078
in front of everyone

408
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,015
is really, really brutal.

409
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,322
Being a popular guy

410
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,491
isn't easy.

411
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,726
Bunta! Your cola!

412
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,727
What?

413
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,896
Will you be okay, Shuji?

414
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,798
But you can't say yes to her.

415
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,300
I mean, then you'll have to date forever.

416
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,704
Kotani must be on cloud nine!

417
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,038
Cloud nine!

418
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,508
-Congratulations!
-Good for you!

419
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,647
"Tomorrow" is written as "bright day."
But will it be?

420
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,784
You'll just have to wait
until tomorrow to find out.

421
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,360
Nobuta.

422
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,830
I'm sorry,

423
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,433
but probably

424
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,569
I'll dump the water on you.

425
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,105
Okay.

426
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,308
I don't mind.

427
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,580
Sorry.

428
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,853
I apologize too, for causing you trouble.

429
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,256
Bye.

430
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,725
Hold on.

431
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,495
Do you think it's okay for the producer

432
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,465
who's supposed to
make Nobuta popular to say that?

433
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,534
Do you?

434
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,207
What is it?

435
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:41,012
How do I give myself strength?

436
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,587
Nobuta power charge!

437
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,290
Oink!

438
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,392
That will fill you full of energy!

439
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,376
This is a trick by Bando and the others.

440
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,844
Yes, I know that.

441
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,514
She'll be massively depressed
if you dump water on her.

442
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,552
It's not the same
as Bando and them dumping water on her.

443
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:26,358
After you do it, just saying,
"I didn't want to do that," won't cut it.

444
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:31,029
It's not that easy for a heart
that's been crushed to heal.

445
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,365
Understand?

446
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,039
I heard about Kotani.

447
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,675
Oh, that? That thing?

448
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,510
Actually, I'm not sure what to do.

449
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,313
You're such a nice guy,
I'm kind of worried.

450
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,917
What? How come?
There's no way I'd choose Kotani.

451
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,218
Don't you worry.

452
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,458
-Let's go.
-But are you sure?

453
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,228
It's not like he's my friend or anything.

454
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,829
Let's go.

455
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,834
Is that right?

456
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,353
Nobuta power charge!

457
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,266
What do you want?

458
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,767
Well…

459
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,270
I want to talk to you.

460
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,540
-She wants to talk.
-What could it be?

461
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,044
Just with Bando.

462
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,647
Sure.

463
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,887
Please cancel the confession of love.

464
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,689
No point in telling me that.

465
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:08,193
Once it's been submitted,
it can't be canceled. That's the rule.

466
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,298
I don't want to cause
other people trouble.

467
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,534
Other people? You mean Shuji?

468
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,069
You really are an idiot.

469
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,374
Shuji won't think twice about
dumping water on you. It's obvious.

470
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,146
No one would be fine
with dumping water on someone.

471
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:32,417
But I don't mind at all.
Especially if it's on you.

472
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,758
I don't fit in at school.

473
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,794
But you stick out even more than I do.

474
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,699
You don't have to tell me that.

475
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,402
I've known it since preschool.

476
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,508
Don't you want to change?

477
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,010
It's a little late to be a good girl.

478
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,446
There's no way I can change.

479
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,619
Anyone can change.

480
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,387
What?

481
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,122
I don't want to change anyway.

482
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,529
You hit me.

483
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,966
And you're hit by your boyfriend.

484
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,938
How come you stupidly repeat
the same thing over and over?

485
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,644
Why don't you want to
try to change yourself?

486
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,248
Anyone can change!

487
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,204
<i>Catherine! Catherine!</i>

488
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,807
<i>Time is passing</i>

489
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,645
What will you do, Kiritani?

490
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,980
About what?

491
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,416
If it was just about brains,

492
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,419
you could figure out a way
to get through this.

493
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,289
But when it comes to the heart…

494
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,094
<i>You are</i>

495
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,500
<i>Not who you used to be</i>

496
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,034
Bang!

497
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,014
Everyone, let's do this! Let's do this!

498
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,016
Let's do this!

499
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,219
-Thank you for this food.
-Go ahead.

500
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,424
What? Me?

501
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,927
Why do I have to do it?

502
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,696
Why can't Dad do it sometimes?

503
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,099
-Thanks.
-Sure.

504
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,267
Let's see here…

505
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,804
They're a friend of yours, Shuji.

506
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,739
Excuse me.

507
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,808
What are you doing here?

508
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,209
Are you a friend?

509
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,343
Yes.

510
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,078
But right now, I'm not so sure.

511
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,680
Nice hair band.

512
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,216
Whoa!

513
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,685
You save and wash disposable chopsticks?

514
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,720
That's so green!

515
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,757
What did you come here for?

516
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,325
I came to threaten you.

517
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,760
-What?
-What?

518
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,230
What's that?

519
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,398
What's that there?

520
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,602
-Tiles?
-Tiles.

521
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,638
I've thought it over very carefully.

522
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,776
I won't stand for
Nobuta getting water dumped on her.

523
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,578
So…

524
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,451
if you dump water on her tomorrow,
you'll pay.

525
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,352
Bang!

526
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,955
I'll pay?

527
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,636
That will be you tomorrow.

528
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,511
Thank you.

529
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,915
Okay.

530
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,085
Wow! You're having miso <i>oden </i>tonight!

531
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,355
Delicious!

532
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,125
Thanks for letting me drop by.

533
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,996
What was that?

534
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,952
No matter how much I think about it,
I can't figure out what to do.

535
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,097
I know!

536
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,766
I'll decide by Ghost Leg.

537
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,276
FLOWERS, WATER, FLOWERS, WATER

538
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,979
Okay.

539
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,659
Hello everybody!

540
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,929
Hello!

541
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,632
The day has arrived!

542
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,902
This year's day for love has arrived!

543
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,740
Amazingly, this year's contestant is

544
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,275
a woman!

545
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,843
What a surprise!

546
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,315
-Okay, let's bring in the contestant.
-Let's bring her in!

547
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:08,820
From Class B, second year, Nobuko Kotani!

548
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:13,825
-Kotani!
-Kotani!

549
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,334
Come on in!

550
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,205
Up here please. This way.

551
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,376
Nobuko,

552
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:35,847
the one you want to confess your love to
is Shuji Kiritani from your class, right?

553
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:46,557
Now, it's time for
Shuji Kiritani's entrance!

554
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,892
Come in, please!

555
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,129
-Shuji!
-Shuji!

556
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,833
-Shuji!
-There he is, Shuji Kiritani!

557
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,604
What will his answer be?

558
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,641
The crowd's really on fire!

559
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,946
Okay. Now the stars of 114 are here.

560
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,250
Will a new love be born

561
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,553
or will it crumble to pieces?

562
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,058
Kotani, make your
confession of love, please!

563
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,165
Anything is fine. Let us hear it.

564
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,472
People

565
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,908
can change, right?

566
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,944
What was that just now?

567
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,446
Was that some kind of code?

568
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,814
Okay, Kiritani.

569
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,818
There are two ropes here.

570
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,854
Grab onto both of them.

571
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,788
Right.

572
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,460
Of these two ropes,

573
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,695
one leads to flowers.

574
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,964
Flutters. "I love you!"

575
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,299
One leads to water.

576
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,134
Splash! "Achoo!"

577
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:08,005
What will become of Kotani's love?

578
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:12,043
Now, Kiritani, give us your decision!

579
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,721
WILL IT BE FLOWERS OR WATER?

580
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,074
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

581
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,312
Can I make a change?

582
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,347
What?

583
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,882
Change what?

584
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,720
Can I change the person?

585
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,457
You mean, you don't want Kiritani?

586
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,928
Shuji, you're out!

587
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,296
Out?

588
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,832
Out.

589
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,234
Sorry for the trouble.

590
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,202
Bicycle.

591
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,403
-Bye-bicycle.
-Bye-bicycle.

592
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,274
-This is probably a good thing.
-Yes. You're safe now.

593
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,942
Then, Kotani,

594
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,112
who will you confess your love to now?

595
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,518
The person I actually love is

596
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,296
Kozue Bando.

597
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,400
Bando?

598
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,704
But she's a girl.

599
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,041
Kozue Bando,

600
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,010
please.

601
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,646
I'm not sure what to do now.

602
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,416
In this day and age, anything goes, right?

603
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,483
You may be right.

604
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,787
Then please come up, Bando!

605
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,721
Please!

606
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,457
-Bando!
-Bando!

607
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,659
Bando will dump water on her for sure.

608
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,661
-What's Kotani thinking?
-Yes.

609
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,130
This way, please.
Sorry for suddenly calling you up.

610
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,498
Sorry about this.

611
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,537
Bando, I explained the rules a moment ago.

612
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,474
Please give us your decision!

613
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,508
What?

614
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,077
What a miracle…

615
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,351
-What?
-You pulled the wrong one!

616
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,721
Wait! Bando! Make a statement!

617
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,358
Why the flowers?

618
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,726
It was an accident.

619
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,461
No way. That blows!

620
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,166
Well, this is really something!

621
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,467
It's a miracle!

622
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,949
Shuji!

623
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,686
Which one were you going to pull?

624
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,022
Does it really matter?

625
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,826
I bet you knew
this would happen from the start, right?

626
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,666
But you know,

627
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,470
I never thought Nobuta would say that.

628
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,773
And why did Bando drop the flowers?

629
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:42,313
Maybe she wanted to do
the opposite of what everyone expected.

630
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,349
You think so?

631
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:50,988
<i>Maybe she wanted to believe
that even she could change.</i>

632
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,996
Everyone, get out your notebooks.

633
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,899
Oink oink.

634
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,606
I would like the Nobuta Project team
to go and view the autumn colors.

635
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,974
-Not going.
-How about it?

636
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,509
-I'm not going.
-Fall colors.

637
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,643
-I'm not going!
-Yes!

638
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,712
No! Stop it!

639
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,480
-Tell me the truth!
-Help!

640
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,815
Tell me the truth!

641
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,653
-No!
-Tell me the truth!

642
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,156
No! Stop!

643
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,690
What was that?

644
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,126
-Truth Man.
-What's that?

645
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,028
He's for real.

646
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,496
What is that?

647
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,198
Wow!

648
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,810
This is Nobuta's.

649
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,077
NAME: NOBUKO KOTANI

650
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:58,522
Awesome! Totally awesome!

651
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,459
Nobuta's a genius.

652
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,762
Tell me the truth.

653
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,899
No! It's him!

654
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,569
-Tell me the truth!
-It's him!

655
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,705
Tell me the truth! Okay?

656
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,476
Tell me the truth! Please!

657
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,777
-The truth?
-Yes.

658
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,112
Okay.

659
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,548
I like Nobuta.
