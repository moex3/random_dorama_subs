1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,007
Mariko! Good morning!

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,576
Good morning. Morning, Shuji.

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:10,610
Morning.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,814
When I got home yesterday…

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:20,620
<i>She's turned out pretty cute
after she got her hair cut.</i>

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,092
<i>But why is there an aura of depression
just around Nobuta?</i>

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>There's something she's lacking.</i>

8
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,883
DEAR NOBUKO KOTANI

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,918
"I love…"

10
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,288
"I love you"?

11
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,192
<i>What is it that Nobuta's lacking?</i>

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,062
-That's right.
-Oh, don't say that!

13
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,664
<i>Oh, that's what it is!</i>

14
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,598
<i>That's it!</i>

15
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,202
<i>What Nobuta lacks is
that flirty way of talking around guys!</i>

16
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,337
It sure doesn't sound like you're joking!

17
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,472
Wow!

18
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,043
<i>That trick of twisting coyly
so she looks cute to guys!</i>

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,845
I'll never forgive you.

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,946
<i>That's it!</i>

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,848
<i>The skills for attracting guys.</i>

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,316
<i>That's what it is.</i>

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,353
<i>What Nobuta lacks is
communication with guys!</i>

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>In other words, the experience of love.</i>

25
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,892
Love…

26
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,363
-Love?
-Love?

27
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,238
-Love?
-Love?

28
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,407
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

29
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,943
What? You still haven't left for school?

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,613
Putting on my shoes is a pain in the neck.

31
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,051
How can a young kid like you
say things like that?

32
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,187
Nothing seems to matter anymore.

33
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,025
Have you fallen in love?

34
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,196
I bet I know.

35
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,600
Before you were just fine by yourself.

36
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,603
But now you can't stand being alone.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,443
You buy a bunch of magazines and CDs
to kill time when you're alone at night,

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,211
but you're still really lonely.

39
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,580
Yes.

40
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,582
That is love.

41
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,319
You're amazing, Mr. Hirayama.

42
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,222
I'm an active pupil of love.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,525
You mean you're still in love?

44
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,461
In my case, I'm in love with my work.

45
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,363
Oh, your work.

46
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,200
You sure you want to sit here moping?

47
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,604
<i>Your rival could be thinking,
"I'll tell her today how I feel!"</i>

48
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,573
<i>He's put his pants on.</i>

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,643
<i>He's just put on his right shoe!</i>

50
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,212
Ouch!

51
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:01,781
See you!

52
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,716
Bye.

53
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,951
Yes, he's in love.

54
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:26,940
<i>What?</i>

55
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,508
<i>What?</i>

56
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,344
<i>What?</i>

57
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,692
<i>No way!</i>

58
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,673
-Well--
-I thought of what we should do next.

59
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,976
Where did he go?

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,880
Yip.

61
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,282
Come over here.

62
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,887
What's your problem?

63
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,691
Are you a shy fox or something?

64
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,695
You know what I realized?

65
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,933
What you obviously lack is
a flirtatious attitude.

66
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,435
A flirtatious attitude?

67
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,404
Yes. You're not frisky.

68
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,274
So why don't you have a romance?

69
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,441
A romance?

70
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,044
Romance is great!

71
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,912
I heard it's great for your complexion.

72
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,749
Her complexion is plenty fine already!
Are you blind, Shuji?

73
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,350
Oh, would you shut up?

74
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,352
Shut up.

75
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,421
Well…

76
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,389
Yes?

77
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,560
What?

78
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,864
A love letter? For you?

79
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,465
No way! Really?

80
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,467
It's from Shittaka!

81
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,136
What? No way!

82
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,039
How come? Ouch!

83
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:06,939
She loves me.

84
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,908
She loves me not.

85
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,510
She loves me.

86
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,680
-You think he's a good choice?
-Yes.

87
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,715
She loves me not.

88
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,550
You think he's a good choice?

89
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,285
What are you doing?

90
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,054
What's your problem?

91
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,290
You almost blew it.

92
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,458
What?

93
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,694
I…

94
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,329
don't think I can do it.

95
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,999
-It'll be just fine! Leave it to us.
-No, it won't work.

96
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,336
Being in high school is
the time for love! Right?

97
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,737
<i>That's it!</i>

98
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,606
<i>A cheerful and pure romance
between a man and a woman!</i>

99
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,642
<i>Let's do this!</i>

100
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,769
I'm a little… just a little…

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,805
attracted to her.

102
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,840
Me too.

103
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,510
To be honest,
I think Kotani is kind of pretty too.

104
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,846
-You're kidding! You think so too?
-Yes.

105
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,850
-You do?
-And she'll just keep gaining popularity.

106
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,952
So you need to get her now.

107
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,021
That's right!
That's exactly what I was thinking too!

108
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,993
You need to strike now
because she'll be popular in no time.

109
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,462
Say, why don't we go on a double date?

110
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,197
A double date?

111
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,432
A double date.

112
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,267
-A double date?
-Yes.

113
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,504
I thought we could bring
bento lunches too.

114
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,438
Really.

115
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,541
But are you sure you will?

116
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,878
Don't be silly. Of course I'm sure.

117
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,648
Every time you promise to do something
with me, you cancel at the last minute.

118
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,050
There! I got it!

119
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,521
-Look.
-Oh, you did it!

120
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,890
Wow! You're good at this kind of thing.

121
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,260
That's why I want you to depend on me.

122
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,428
-Okay.
-Good.

123
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,762
A date?

124
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,432
It's not one of those big deals though.

125
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,935
I'll be there too. It'll be fine. Okay?

126
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,373
But I've never gone on a date.

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,275
Then it's about time.

128
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,011
I mean, do you plan on
spending your whole life alone

129
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,346
without ever dating anyone?

130
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,953
Hey! Wait!

131
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,154
Ouch!

132
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:53,940
Get closer.

133
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,041
Get closer.

134
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,743
Come on, get closer.

135
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,845
Hurry.

136
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,446
What?

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,715
No! Don't run!

138
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,183
Don't run!

139
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,886
No…

140
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,521
She ran away.

141
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,394
-Shuji!
-What?

142
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,830
-I knew it! She hates me!
-What's wrong?

143
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,165
-She ran off!
-Really?

144
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,636
You've got it all wrong!
That's her way of saying she likes you.

145
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,205
-But…
-"Her way of saying she likes you"?

146
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,207
Never mind.

147
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,210
-She rejected you?
-What's going on?

148
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,012
Who? Who loves who?

149
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,581
-You mean you, Shittaka?
-Who? Who do you like?

150
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,682
Kotani!

151
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,451
Kotani just rejected you, right?

152
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,719
I saw it.

153
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,121
No way! You like Kotani, Shittaka?

154
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,490
-Quit shouting!
-And she rejected you?

155
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,826
She didn't reject him.
They're just getting started.

156
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,496
You mean, she'll reject me later?

157
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,031
No! Not that!

158
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,233
Have some confidence, man.

159
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,536
Shittaka, you've got shitty taste.

160
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,472
What's so great about Kotani?

161
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,277
When someone falls in love, that's…

162
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,718
something beautiful, right?

163
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,686
-Yes.
-Yes.

164
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,621
-That's right.
-It's beautiful.

165
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:22,161
Dates, you see,
they're a really casual thing. Okay?

166
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,931
I mean, Shittaka says he really likes you.

167
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,600
-"I don't like him."
-You'll ignore his feelings for you?

168
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,369
"Of course, I'll ignore them!"

169
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,873
-You'll go. Right? Let's go.
-"I'm not going. I'm not going!"

170
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,075
"I'm not going. I'm not!"

171
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,211
Yes! Let's do our best, Nobuta!

172
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,780
-No!
-What?

173
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:41,781
That's lewd!

174
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,149
-What is?
-No!

175
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,183
You won't go, right?

176
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,785
There's no way she'll go.

177
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,394
When you hear this laugh,
it means there will be misfortune.

178
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,263
This date won't go well.

179
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,803
What the heck is that?

180
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,572
-Isn't it coming from the sky?
-Yes.

181
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,907
Not this laugh again!

182
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,875
I guess something bad will happen again.

183
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,079
Wait! When you hear this laugh,
bad things happen?

184
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,181
-That's the rumor.
-Really?

185
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,516
Last year,
Class 2C's trouble with the police was

186
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,785
right after we heard this laugh, right?

187
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,055
Oh, yeah. That was a huge problem.

188
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,958
I pray that it doesn't involve my class!

189
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,367
Don't you think it sounds like
Head Teacher Sada's laugh?

190
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,869
That's what I've always thought.

191
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:37,770
Right?

192
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,176
Hey!

193
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,611
-Wait!
-That's uncool!

194
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,447
-Mr. Saotome! Wait!
-Hey!

195
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,917
Oh, I didn't know that.

196
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,453
You sure are smart, Shittaka.

197
00:10:55,454 --> 00:11:00,192
If you talk like that, you'll flatter him.
That's what's important. Okay?

198
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,596
And no more running away.

199
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,533
If he tries to touch you,

200
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,635
then gently refuse him.

201
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,903
Gently.

202
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,639
I'll show you how to do that. Here goes.

203
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,508
-If he goes like--
-Stop!

204
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,510
I'll handle it from there.

205
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,378
Sure, go ahead.

206
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,947
Get over there.

207
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,016
Excuse me.

208
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,787
If Shittaka tries to make a move on you…

209
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,288
"Make a move"?

210
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,692
-How lewd!
-What?

211
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,529
Why not say "put his arm around you"?

212
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,864
Who cares what you call it?

213
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,967
Fine. If Shittaka tries to
put his arm around you…

214
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,636
Put your arm around her.

215
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,638
Go on. Do it. Right.

216
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,572
What?

217
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,541
-I can't move!
-What?

218
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,377
-My arm won't move!
-What's your problem?

219
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,345
Enough! I'm taking over!

220
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,917
So if Shittaka comes at you like this--

221
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,452
Wait! I have an idea!

222
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,354
Shuji, you and I, we'll do it.

223
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,355
How come?

224
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:08,427
That way, if she can see it for herself,
it's easier for her to understand.

225
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,531
Oh, I guess you're right.

226
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,533
So who is who?

227
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,469
You be Nobuta. I'll be Shittaka.

228
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,604
I'm Nobuta. Okay.

229
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,141
I'll play you. Watch closely.

230
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,676
Okay.

231
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,848
I…

232
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,018
-I love you!
-Don't.

233
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,320
Don't do that.

234
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,721
-But…
-Don't.

235
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,759
I love you so much,
my heart is about to burst.

236
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,128
What does that mean?

237
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,563
I love you this much!

238
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,798
I like you too.

239
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:50,669
Oops!

240
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,643
Wait!

241
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,246
-It's not what you think!
-Don't worry.

242
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,348
My lips are sealed.

243
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,154
Don't worry!

244
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,729
LEMON AND HONEY

245
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,633
Since we're trying to get
Kotani and Shittaka together,

246
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,470
if you're there, Mariko,

247
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,372
Kotani's flaws…

248
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,977
They'll be more obvious.

249
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:32,878
Give me that.

250
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,818
Then why don't I play
a totally horrible girlfriend?

251
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,455
I'll make her look good. Leave it to me.

252
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,591
-Make her look good?
-Yes.

253
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,859
You will?

254
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,361
No way. You'll never be able to do that.

255
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,063
There.

256
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,298
Wow!

257
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,933
Leave it to me.

258
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,337
Can you tell me the key
to making a date a success?

259
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,405
The key?

260
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,844
At the end of it, if you say,
"I had fun today," that's the key.

261
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,744
Oh, I get it.

262
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,814
It kind of means, "I want to do it again."

263
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:13,052
Right. But Kotani needs
to say it from the heart.

264
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,854
Good point! That's right.

265
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,489
It has to come from the heart!
From the heart!

266
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,958
That's really crucial.

267
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,260
It has to come from the heart.

268
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,266
There.

269
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,968
Okay, they're ready.

270
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,103
This is for Shittaka. This is Nobuta's.

271
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,305
And Mariko will bring mine.

272
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,473
Where's mine?

273
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,308
-You're not part of this.
-Here.

274
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,576
-Your tea.
-Thank you so much!

275
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,510
Thank you so much!

276
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,446
There.

277
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,182
Then what am I supposed to do?

278
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,185
Nothing. Just stay here.

279
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,853
Watch TV or something.

280
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,725
You guys go on a date
while I have to sit at home?

281
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,528
If you're there,
that puts everything out of balance.

282
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,063
Don't you dare come.

283
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,498
Here.

284
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,669
-There's something on your face.
-I put it there.

285
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,171
-We're going! Thanks.
-See you later.

286
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,274
-Goodbye.
-See you later.

287
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,943
Yip.

288
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,345
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know.

289
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,649
Was the baby left behind?

290
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,920
I won't stand for this!

291
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,421
Okay.

292
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,957
Try saying, "I had fun today."

293
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,994
"I had fun today."

294
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,697
That's not quite right.
Try being more energetic.

295
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,831
Like…

296
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,333
"I had fun today!"

297
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,234
Okay?

298
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,106
"I had fun today."

299
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,776
Good enough.

300
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,380
How about we practice holding hands?

301
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,316
Okay? Here.

302
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,886
What? Ouch!

303
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,429
Hi, Kotani!

304
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,870
She's nervous.

305
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,576
Morning.

306
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,611
Let's have a good time today.

307
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,580
I had…

308
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,117
fun today.

309
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,155
That's the kind of day
you want to have, right?

310
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,157
Let's have a day like that.

311
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,459
Let's have a fun day.

312
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,427
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

313
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,896
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,198
Hurry up.

315
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,838
Yip.

316
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,145
Hurry up, you guys.

317
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,617
Kotani, isn't this cute?

318
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,523
Oh, look at this!

319
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,293
-And this.
-This?

320
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,661
Yes.

321
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,399
-What do you want to do next?
-Is there anything you want, Shuji?

322
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,238
Which of these do you think is best?

323
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,241
How about this one?

324
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,209
We don't need that many.

325
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,011
-Get a matching set.
-A matching set.

326
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,142
-I want to ride the Ferris wheel.
-The Ferris wheel?

327
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,645
That sounds fun!

328
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,824
Sir,

329
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,327
how would you like
a magnificent insect encyclopedia?

330
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,162
How about it?

331
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,230
A hundred million yen?

332
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,535
-Okay, let's have lunch.
-Let's have lunch.

333
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,672
Bento time.

334
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,777
Wow! How cute!

335
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,312
This is really cute!

336
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,980
This is so darn cute!

337
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,915
Yuck! Disgusting!

338
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,917
Here goes!

339
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,986
-No way!
-Looks good, doesn't it?

340
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,455
What? Oh, yeah. Really good.

341
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,359
Today, she made it to look like charcoal.

342
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,361
You always eat stuff like this?

343
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,030
That's right. It's extra special.

344
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,665
-Extra special?
-It's usually just this.

345
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,167
-Shuji.
-Yes?

346
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,368
What about tea?

347
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,204
I've got tea. Hold on a second.

348
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,372
Here.

349
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,976
Not that.
It has to be the stuff from the store.

350
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:04,910
What?

351
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,411
Go buy some.

352
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,114
Oh, sure.

353
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,186
And it better be hot.

354
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,288
Oh, yeah. You're right.

355
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,191
You always want it hot. Sorry.
I forgot. Sorry.

356
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,193
-I'll go buy some.
-Okay.

357
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,396
Shuji. Is Uehara always like that?

358
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,031
Oh, yeah.

359
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,400
Oh, I see.

360
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,170
I'll go buy that tea,
but you go ahead and eat.

361
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,104
Okay.

362
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,307
-This is great!
-I'll go buy some.

363
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,809
This is really good.

364
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,748
What should I have next?

365
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,251
-Can I have this?
-Wait!

366
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,920
There's only one of those!

367
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,289
Delicious!

368
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,199
What the heck are you doing?

369
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,500
What?

370
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,868
What a coincidence!

371
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,205
-I told you not to come!
-You know, we may be the best couple ever!

372
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,840
Don't you dare interfere.

373
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,177
-Okay?
-Okay?

374
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,345
-Okay?
-Okay?

375
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,647
Don't you dare interfere!

376
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,050
-Look how close they are together!
-Get back here!

377
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:24,623
The chance they'll be a couple
is now 99.99 percent!

378
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,724
All right!

379
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,692
This won't succeed.

380
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,893
-What?
-This won't succeed.

381
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,728
Don't you dare interfere, man!

382
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,996
Don't interfere!

383
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,565
I'm back!

384
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,202
We've got other plans.

385
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,137
We're going shopping in Ginza.

386
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,038
Bye.

387
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,707
-Bye.
-See you.

388
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,649
Shittaka. You can do it!

389
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,491
Let's go.

390
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,794
-Shuji,
-Yes?

391
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,163
you're acting like Kotani's father.

392
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,832
What? Her father?

393
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,134
-That's right.
-That's a shock.

394
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,303
-You're like her father.
-I am not.

395
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,507
Say, are you thirsty?

396
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,442
I'll get you something. Hold on.

397
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:32,224
Nobuta power charge!

398
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,861
What a goofball.

399
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,464
You're in the middle of a date.

400
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,802
-Thanks.
-Sure.

401
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,642
-You know, sorry about today.
-It's okay.

402
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,345
I wonder if it'll go well for those two.

403
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,882
It'll be just fine. You did
a great job playing the awful girlfriend.

404
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,621
I had fun today.

405
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,456
Okay…

406
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,661
I guess my heart wasn't in it.

407
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,635
They're really cute.

408
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,869
Yes.

409
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,771
They're cute.

410
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,115
Here goes.

411
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,118
Say cheese.

412
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,493
Akira's in shock!

413
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,503
The ending of the movie <i>Carrie</i>,

414
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,072
Stephen King apparently didn't like it.

415
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,443
But that's the movie
that made him popular.

416
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,480
De Palma's movie is really scary.

417
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,248
The end will scare you for sure.

418
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,485
It suddenly shocks you!

419
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,762
Are…

420
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,663
Are you okay?

421
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,566
What will we do?

422
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,667
"What will we do?"

423
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,204
-Oh, no.
-Mister, are you okay?

424
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,306
Anyway, call an ambulance.

425
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,408
An ambulance?

426
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,109
An ambulance?

427
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,644
I'll call it.

428
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,347
Thank you.

429
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,548
Hello?

430
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,218
-Mister, are you okay?
-I'm at the aquarium.

431
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,353
A man.

432
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,756
-We're calling an ambulance now.
-His age? He's an old man.

433
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,760
Get my bag.

434
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,100
Gross!

435
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,508
Bang!

436
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,345
No! No, that's not what I mean!

437
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,714
That's the hand you touched him with!

438
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,820
No…

439
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:15,987
That's not what I mean.

440
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,057
No…

441
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,560
I meant…

442
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,065
I'll get a staff member.

443
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,385
You're not gross at all.

444
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,156
Look at this.

445
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,193
What a gentle hand this is.

446
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,431
Isn't that right, mister?

447
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,492
You did so much for me.

448
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,061
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,032
You mean about the date?

450
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,040
For my sake,

451
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,378
you all did so much. Even Uehara.

452
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,083
It's not your fault, you know, Nobuta.

453
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,754
But if I had done a better job…

454
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,159
I wanted to live up to

455
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,762
your expectations.

456
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,967
I wanted it to go well…

457
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,637
and then

458
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,108
I could tell all of you "thank you."

459
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,447
There you are.

460
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,351
Apparently, the old man had
a little too much to drink.

461
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,820
He's talking normally now. He's fine.

462
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,021
Bye.

463
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,960
Thank goodness.

464
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,264
HOSPITAL

465
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,282
The sky sure is beautiful.

466
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,718
Yes.

467
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,523
It's the kind of sky
that makes you want to play catch.

468
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,827
I never have though.

469
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,268
<i>These two</i>

470
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,139
<i>are always throwing the ball to me.</i>

471
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,745
<i>But all I can do is just catch it.</i>

472
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,084
<i>That's why I want to
toss it back to them someday.</i>

473
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,921
<i>If I could throw it</i>

474
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,526
<i>so it fell right into their gloves,</i>

475
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,295
<i>that sure would feel nice.</i>

476
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,855
I'm home!

477
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,765
Is she alive?

478
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,970
She collapsed
after returning from her trip.

479
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,473
So leave her be and let her sleep.

480
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,111
-I bought the okra.
-Welcome back.

481
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,914
Aren't we having shabu-shabu? Why okra?

482
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,684
Not sure why, but she shouted
"okra" in her sleep. Right?

483
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,585
Right.

484
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,789
Broccoli?

485
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,459
Koji.

486
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,294
Broccoli.

487
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,995
-Yes.
-What?

488
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,099
Broccoli too?

489
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,372
So what about the shabu-shabu?

490
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,875
It's postponed until your mother wakes up.

491
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,477
What?

492
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,547
-I was looking forward to that meat.
-Meat!

493
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,950
Meat!

494
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,874
You're not gross at all.

495
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,544
My hand!

496
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,412
I…

497
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,480
That was really bold!

498
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,849
Oh, dear! I'm so ashamed!

499
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,184
Nobuta!

500
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,753
Nobuta! Ouch!

501
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,656
Nobuta! I don't think
I can look at her face now!

502
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,893
I'm so ashamed! Oh, dear! What'll I do?

503
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,695
Oh, no! I can't see!

504
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,164
I can't see a thing!

505
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,101
A young man, burning with desire alone.

506
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,235
Oh, dear!

507
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,136
Nobuta!

508
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,386
"Nobuko Kotani's
shocking relationship with men."

509
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,088
-"Disgusting woman, Nobuko Kotani."
-What is this?

510
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,157
"Her next prey is Ueki from class 2B."

511
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,259
-What a slut!
-No way!

512
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,798
NOBUKO KOTANI'S
SHOCKING RELATIONSHIP WITH MEN.

513
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,068
What? What's up?
This place sure is colorful.

514
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,603
What?

515
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,442
It's my class again.

516
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,547
I hate this kind of thing.

517
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,664
Hey.

518
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,278
You know,

519
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,216
even after these flyers were posted,
Shittaka says he still wants to date you.

520
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,186
If you actually do date,

521
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,189
everybody will forget these rumors.

522
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,292
So

523
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,562
why don't you make up with him?

524
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,535
But Shittaka called Nobuta gross.

525
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,905
He regrets what he said.

526
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,574
He's sorry about it.

527
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:56,414
So you see, he wants you to forgive him.

528
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,051
You're still upset?

529
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:08,960
I just think dating someone
who I don't like

530
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,995
is wrong.

531
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,632
What are you talking about?
Everyone does it.

532
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:19,070
You need experience in order
to learn how to get along with people.

533
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,906
I mean, you want to become popular, right?

534
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,544
Aren't you doing all these things
to become popular?

535
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:28,980
Aren't you?

536
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,987
No.

537
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,555
"No"?

538
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,459
But isn't that why
we're doing all this work?

539
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,928
Isn't it?

540
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,631
You mean,

541
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,600
you don't want to become popular?

542
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,075
What?

543
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,010
What? Are you kidding?

544
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,747
Now I feel like a total idiot.

545
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,282
This doesn't make any sense.

546
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,152
These flyers are everywhere, you know?

547
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,022
Before long, nobody will talk to you!

548
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,457
Understand?

549
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,963
You believe those flyers?

550
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,233
This isn't about
whether I believe them or not!

551
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,202
Of course, I don't believe them!

552
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,538
But these things were plastered all over!

553
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,141
It's only a matter of time
before everyone believes them!

554
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,876
Understand?

555
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,380
"With all these flyers around,
Nobuta will be worthless soon,

556
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,515
so let's sell her cheap now!"

557
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,917
That's what it sounds like you're saying.

558
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,154
Nobuta is Nobuta.

559
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,390
Even with these flyers out there,

560
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,659
Nobuta is the same Nobuta we both know.

561
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,562
She's the same person she's always been.

562
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,620
-These flyers are frightening.
-Yes.

563
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,989
-They were in the girls' restroom.
-The boys' too.

564
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,090
The gym too.

565
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,892
-They're all over school.
-Yes.

566
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:26,063
Kotani is pretty bad, but I heard
Mariko Uehara is really nasty too.

567
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,465
I heard she's a terrible cook.

568
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,234
Really? I guess she's all talk.

569
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,137
Did you hear about Uehara?

570
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,205
No! What about her?

571
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,774
I heard she doesn't make
her bento lunches herself.

572
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,209
-Seriously? What a fraud!
-Yes!

573
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,145
Excuse me for a second.

574
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,683
What's wrong, Shuji?

575
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,918
Well…

576
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,555
Because of yesterday's date,

577
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,791
bad rumors about you
are spreading now too.

578
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,892
Well…

579
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,694
That's all right.

580
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,630
But they're not true.

581
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,367
You know the truth, Shuji.
That's enough for me.

582
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,303
But…

583
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,038
I told you. I don't mind.

584
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,075
As long as someone knows the truth,
that's enough for me.

585
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,712
Since you know the truth,
that's good enough.

586
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,150
Sorry,
but I've got to go back to practice.

587
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,318
-Okay.
-Bye.

588
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,898
What are you doing?

589
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,069
I caught that bird
that's been doing that crazy laughing.

590
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,539
It's a myna bird.

591
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,641
That's right. A myna bird.

592
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,712
It must have escaped from its owner.

593
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,617
Everyone says it sounds like me.

594
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,185
You troublemaker!

595
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,588
It was a bird?

596
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,589
What?

597
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,658
Wait a minute here.

598
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,862
Even the calm and cool Shuji Kiritani

599
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,834
was deceived by that rumor?

600
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,469
Oh, say…

601
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,775
Are you letting
this kind of thing deceive you too?

602
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,549
Kiritani, do not be afraid.

603
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,785
This is nothing but garbage.

604
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,056
It's the kind of garbage
you find anywhere.

605
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:51,709
What are you doing?

606
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,811
Oh, it's you.

607
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,514
Mom went off for work again.

608
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,385
But what are you doing, Dad?

609
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,691
The plane she's on
will be passing by pretty soon.

610
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:12,730
You're hardly ever together,
so what was the point of getting married?

611
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,334
Don't be stupid. We got married
because we are hardly ever together.

612
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:21,138
Now that we're married,
I can see her at least a few times a year.

613
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,039
Seriously?

614
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,941
You bet. I'm totally serious.

615
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:29,113
Just knowing that
there's someone somewhere in this world

616
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,515
who knows everything cool about me,

617
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,253
and everything lame
and pathetic about me is good enough.

618
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,121
That's all I need.

619
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:43,761
Hey.

620
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,363
Is that it?

621
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,430
That's it!

622
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,400
Nobutan!

623
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,935
"Nobutan"?

624
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,304
Yes. That's what I used to call her.

625
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,873
Nobutan!

626
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:07,285
I just think dating someone
who I don't like is wrong.

627
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,265
Shuji.

628
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,470
What's with you?

629
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,405
What do you want?

630
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,540
Come with me.

631
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,975
What? Why?

632
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:32,943
Yip.

633
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,012
What's this about?

634
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,425
We're going to tail Nobuta.

635
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,559
How come?

636
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,729
Come on.

637
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:17,955
Here, she practices smiling
with Tarokichi, the dog.

638
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,595
And here,

639
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,199
she always says a prayer.

640
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,546
She gazes at the vegetables
but never buys any.

641
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:51,722
They…

642
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,159
They're very pretty.

643
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,395
You're very pretty too.

644
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,797
And she talks with the florist.

645
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,213
Us two…

646
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,184
we don't know anything about Nobuta.

647
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,356
In fact, we never even tried
to learn more about her.

648
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,263
Do you know what her wish is?

649
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,567
To become popular someday

650
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:43,007
and then tell you, "Thank you!"

651
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,215
Nobuta!

652
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:02,193
Shuji has something to say to you!

653
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,684
You know…

654
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,693
I want to make you popular.

655
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:54,011
<i>And then, I want to see you
laugh at silly things…</i>

656
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,716
<i>until you double over and cry</i>

657
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,989
<i>like any ordinary girl would.</i>

658
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,676
<i>Like I was told,
the flyers turned into just garbage.</i>

659
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,091
<i>And the date caused something unexpected.</i>

660
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,460
Kotani.

661
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,866
The man you helped was my grandpa.

662
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,403
Oh, is that right?

663
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,405
Thank you.

664
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,676
My grandpa was really happy.

665
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,946
Come see him sometime.
It'll make him happy for sure.

666
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,347
Okay?

667
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,281
Okay.

668
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,385
<i>Nobuta made a friend.</i>

669
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:13,958
Nobuta…

670
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,527
Let's go.

671
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,767
<i>There's something
I can't help thinking right now.</i>

672
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,345
<i>I don't want to lose to</i>

673
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,917
<i>anyone who isn't honestly pleased
when other people find joy.</i>

674
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,854
You don't know it?

675
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,889
Then I'll take you there sometime.

676
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,427
Do you like <i>monjayaki</i>, Kotani?

677
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,831

don't want them to get the best of me.</i>

678
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,000
Yes, I do.

679
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,541
We'll get rich off of Nobuta?

680
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,276
We'll be rolling in cash!

00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,479
You young people obsessed with money!

682
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,948
Shall be punished!
