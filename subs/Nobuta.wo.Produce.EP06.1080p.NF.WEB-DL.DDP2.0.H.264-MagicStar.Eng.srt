1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,405
What did I want to be?

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,874
Yes. What did you
want to be when you grew up?

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,878
A man with
strong bonds of friendship, of course.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:12,879
What does that mean?

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,814
I think he means

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,951
a guy who cares about his friends.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,885
That's right.

8
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,221
But that's normal, right?

9
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,489
No, it's not!

10
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,225
For example, one day, out of the blue,

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,330
your friend comes to your place
carrying a suitcase.

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>And inside the suitcase is</i>

13
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>a dismembered body!</i>

14
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,871
Oh, no!

15
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:41,207
For some reason,
that friend ended up killing someone.

16
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,943
Then?

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,280
That friend came to me
because he knew he could depend on me.

18
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,152
-But you know, that's murder, right?
-Right!

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,153
I know!

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,426
I know that,
but I'll listen to his whole story.

21
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,061
That's true friendship.

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,798
That's the strong bond of male friendship!

23
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,267
Ouch! That's hot!

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,235
Wouldn't you tell the police?

25
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,970
You can do that later.

26
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:11,905
Later?

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,673
Most importantly,

28
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,177
you listen to your friend's whole story.

29
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,212
That's what's key.

30
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,152
Oh, man!

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,921
Kids do the work.

32
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,223
Why can't you answer sometimes, Dad?

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,959
-Hurry up and answer it.
-Be a good boy and work.

34
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,094
Whoa!

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,962
Shuji's friend has a suitcase!

36
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,063
-A suitcase?
-Yes.

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,703
There's big trouble.

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,071
This is really bad.

39
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,906
What kind of trouble?

40
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,044
-Will you listen to my story?
-Yes.

41
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,479
I'll listen, but...

42
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,647
what's inside that?

43
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,116
Want to see?

44
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,393
What's that?

45
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,529
My overnight stuff!

46
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,197
Wait! You want to stay here?

47
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,233
I've run away.

48
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,300
You've run away?

49
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,436
-Yes.
-"Yes"? Is that any way to talk?

50
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,337
Hey!

51
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,241
You're supposed to tuck
your pajamas inside your pants.

52
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,609
In! Put them in!

53
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,644
-You too, pops.
-"Pops"?

54
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,880
What? Why tuck them in?

55
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,249
It keeps your tummy warm.

56
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,117
That's one of the fundamentals of life!

57
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,420
-Tuck yours in too, Shuji!
-Leave me be!

58
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,321
Tuck in, Shuji!

59
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,691
What's that?

60
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,262
I thought this would be helpful
when turning out the light.

61
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,034
Did you make this pig?

62
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,235
Nobuta did.

63
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,304
Don't you know about Nobuta power?

64
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,839
What's that?

65
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,576
-Excuse me.
-What? What are you doing?

66
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,744
You're creeping me out!

67
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,414
Don't copy me, man.

68
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,183
"Don't copy me, man."

69
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,621
What a pain.

70
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,490
It sure is warm.

71
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,726
Why the heck did you run away?

72
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,198
Well, my old man
came to my boarding house.

73
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,401
What? You mean your dad?

74
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,269
Yes. My real dad.

75
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,174
He told me to start working
for his company. We got in a big fight.

76
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,377
I see.

77
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:36,015
Your dad's the president
of that company, isn't he?

78
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,251
That's right.

79
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,987
But I don't want to go back home.

80
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,558
I like Mr. Hirayama
and I can drink soymilk too.

81
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,661
You…

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,500
and Nobuta, every day…

83
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,672
"Every day"?

84
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,043
"Every day" what?

85
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,716
He's asleep.

86
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,525
Good night.

87
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,531
So how long are you
going to stay at our place?

88
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:30,103
What's wrong with it?
It's lots of fun, don't you think?

89
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,075
Watch out! Oops!

90
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,811
What's wrong?

91
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,914
I was wondering

92
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:47,820
if we'll end up like
these incredibly boring-looking dudes.

93
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,524
I don't want to be like that.

94
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,596
Not like that!
I don't want to be like that!

95
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,766
I'll hand out the
post-graduation surveys now.

96
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,902
Make sure you hand them
back in by next week.

97
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,738
<i>Decide my future by next week?</i>

98
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,743
<i>One week isn't enough
to decide on the rest of my life.</i>

99
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,146
Shuji. What are you going to do?

100
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,247
-Me?
-Yes.

101
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,616
-I haven't decided anything.
-Really?

102
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,952
Tani will try
for a sports scholarship in tennis.

103
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,355
-Really?
-Nami's going to fashion school.

104
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,291
Misaki wants to go to any college
with an English department.

105
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,161
-That's pretty amazing.
-Yes.

106
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,899
<i>Whoa. It's like everyone else has
seriously thought this stuff over.</i>

107
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,468
POST-GRADUATION SURVEY

108
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,937
What will you do?
You going to work at your dad's company?

109
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,341
I'm sick of talking about
what to do after graduation.

110
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,812
Don't you think there's something
more important we need to do?

111
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,080
What's that?

112
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,416
Ouch.

113
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,955
Aren't we going to make Nobuta popular?

114
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,393
That poses lots of problems too.

115
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,297
No matter what we do,
it always starts crazy rumors.

116
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,103
<i>Who the heck keeps making trouble for us?</i>

117
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,209
<i>Must be someone
with nothing else better to do.</i>

118
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,014
Why don't we spread rumors this time?

119
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,218
Good idea! We'll get the jump on them.

120
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,454
I've had it with
letting them always get the better of us.

121
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,889
I've had it!

122
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,395
Okay!

123
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,196
-On go, okay?
-Yes.

124
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,097
Here goes.

125
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,000
Ready. Nobuta!

126
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,638
Sorry.

127
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,541
Ready. Go!

128
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,248
<i>That's right.
We can't keep doing silly stuff forever.</i>

129
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,550
<i>We won't be able to</i>

130
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,386
<i>gaze out into the sky from here</i>

131
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,789
<i>for too much longer.</i>

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,485
Ciao!

133
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,853
-Shuji!
-Yes?

134
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,722
I've been wondering,
what's that on your bag?

135
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,224
There isn't anything on my bag.

136
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,866
This isn't anything.

137
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,067
That's totally cute!

138
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,702
-Yes! It sure is!
-This?

139
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,305
-You think it's cute?
-Did you make that yourself?

140
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,540
-You're really good at that.
-Yes! It's so cute!

141
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,047
Actually, this was made by Kotani.

142
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,583
-No way! Kotani made it?
-Yes, Kotani did.

143
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,084
Kotani made that!

144
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,153
-Go on now!
-Cut that out!

145
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,789
-Kotani! Kotani!
-Wait!

146
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,290
Will you make me one too?

147
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,392
-Me too!
-Yes! Me too!

148
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,330
Okay.

149
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,499
All right!

150
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,467
Can you make a girl one?

151
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,703
Oh, that'll be cute for sure!

152
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,439
-I want a ribbon on mine!
-That sounds cute!

153
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,379
You know what?

154
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:39,018
To get more people to know about Nobuta,
let's sell Nobuta merch.

155
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,788
It'll be called…

156
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,492
the Nobuta Keychain.

157
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,195
-What do you think?
-Will that sell?

158
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,131
Nowadays, even with something
as wacky as this, they say,

159
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,801
"How cute! How totally cute!"
And "How kooky cute!"

160
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,205
And "100% cute!" It'll be a hit for sure.

161
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,008
And "Piggy cute!"
That's exactly what it is! How dumb!

162
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,644
It'll be the talk of the school.

163
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,447
If we can show people
this unexpected side of Nobuta,

164
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,651
your popularity will soar for sure.

165
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,019
Then

166
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,187
let's hand them out for free.

167
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,790
No, don't you see?

168
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,627
People only appreciate something
when they pay for it.

169
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,729
I see.

170
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:30,236
So what we'll do is, we'll get
Nobuta's popularity to skyrocket fast.

171
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,772
-At last, we're going to the majors!
-You bet.

172
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,475
So I'm counting on you
to pay for making the merch.

173
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm fighting with my dad,
so I don't have any money.

174
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,415
Seriously?

175
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,320
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

176
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,354
Yo!

177
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
Good evening.

178
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,897
Say, Mr. Hirayama, is my dad still here?

179
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,899
It's a little late for that.

180
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,968
He left last night.

181
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:02,935
Really?

182
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,004
Thank goodness.

183
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,773
Okay, let's go.

184
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,847
Come right in.

185
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,450
Ouch!

186
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,857
-Whoa!
-"Whoa!"

187
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,858
What happened?

188
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,061
Is this the aftermath of your fight?

189
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,031
One thing my dad has got are strong arms.

190
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,201
He's like that.

191
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,844
There! Done!

192
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,013
Is this too chintzy?

193
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,716
No. In fact, it's that chintzy look
that makes it cute.

194
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,018
-It's cute?
-Yes.

195
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,054
Nobuta power charge!

196
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,522
What?

197
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,959
Since we're making these,
I want to make sure they sell.

198
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,062
Give me that one
you filled with Nobuta power.

199
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,430
Why?

200
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,098
-Didn't you know?
-What?

201
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,535
The potency of Nobuta power
is absolutely phenomenal!

202
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,504
-Nobuta power potency?
-Yes.

203
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,613
That's what we can do!

204
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,214
What's that?

205
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,150
What we'll do is,

206
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,353
we'll spread the rumor that
this thing grants wishes.

207
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,622
Girls love that kind of thing.

208
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,258
-Charms and stuff.
-Rumors.

209
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,660
-Rumors create more rumors.
-Right!

210
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,829
Then these could sell like crazy!

211
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,298
-What do you think?
-Are we going to be millionaires?

212
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,333
We'll be rolling in cash!

213
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,303
Seriously? Awesome!

214
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,772
-Morning.
-Good morning.

215
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,673
Morning.

216
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,875
What?

217
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,744
What are you wishing for, Chie?

218
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,148
That I can talk with Bunta.

219
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,919
-You're so admirable!
-You're so admirable!

220
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,588
Bunta? Okay.

221
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,324
Bunta.

222
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,927
Don't you think Chie is cute?

223
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,428
Are you serious, man?

224
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,696
Serious, man.

225
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,066
See?

226
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,502
Chie's pretty cute, right?

227
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,040
Bunta is gradually starting to realize
that Chie is cute.

228
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,246
Bunta can no longer escape
the allure of Chie's charms.

229
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,315
She really is cute.

230
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,317
Hey!

231
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,919
-She's cute!
-You bet.

232
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,489
-I'm not sure why, but she's really cute!
-You bet.

233
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,359
What's more, I've heard that this thing
will make your wishes come true.

234
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,597
I'll give you one for free, Bunta. Okay?

235
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,333
A real man goes on the attack!

236
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,201
-Okay, Bunta?
-Right.

237
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
You're cute, Chie.

238
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,074
You're cute too, Bunta.

239
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,610
Yes!

240
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,480
Please. May more insects come to me.

241
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,682
Make me a great man!

242
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,417
Got it.

243
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,554
Right there!

244
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,889
"Right there!"

245
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,856
Find anything?

246
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,092
That's too close,
I can't see anything, darn it!

247
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,662
-Look, would you?
-Look, would you?

248
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,768
Great!

249
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,644
-How about a Nobuta Power Charge Doll?
-This is it!

250
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,313
-They're super cute!
-This is the thing!

251
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,918
-Hey, ladies? How about one?
-No way!

252
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,687
-Who wants that junk!
-You actually want one, don't you?

253
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,523
No pushing! No shoving! No running!

254
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,795
That's great!

255
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,664
What's this? Pork?

256
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,698
Pork rib stew.

257
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,935
Pork rib stew?
I've never had this before. Just kidding.

258
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,036
It's really delicious.

259
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:03,142
Lately, you hang around
Kotani and Kusano, don't you?

260
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,810
-I do?
-Yes.

261
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,711
You think?

262
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,479
-I see you together a lot.
-You do?

263
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,052
It's because we're making these.

264
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,720
You're making that?

265
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,688
What?

266
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,223
No, not really.

267
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,558
I'm just helping a little.

268
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,627
I give them ideas and stuff.

269
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,863
Like a part-time job.

270
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,298
-Is that right?
-Yes. Part-time.

271
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,101
-You making money?
-Yes. We're making money.

272
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,736
-I'll treat you sometime.
-Really?

273
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,671
-Yes.
-All right!

274
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,010
They're 200 yen each, right?

275
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,478
That's 600 yen. Pay her.

276
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,414
-Thank you. This is so nice.
-May I get into Tokyo University.

277
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,315
Come on. Let's go.

278
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,184
-Thank you, Kotani.
-Thank you.

279
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,219
Yes, Yes. Come on. Get going.

280
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,122
They're really popular. I'll take one too.

281
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,264
Thank you.

282
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,700
This color is different than the others.

283
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,504
That one… I made it for you.

284
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,505
Really?

285
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,641
Thank you!

286
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,013
You don't have to pay for it.

287
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,714
What? No, I'll pay.

288
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,782
No.

289
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,851
You…

290
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,486
You're my f…

291
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,726
You mean, you'll give me a discount
because we're friends?

292
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,434
Okay. Since we're friends,
I'll have it for free.

293
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,069
Okay?

294
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,340
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

295
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,110
Okay. I'll give you this for it.

296
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,679
A present.

297
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,519
Thank you.

298
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,190
Whoa!

299
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,159
What's wrong?

300
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,363
I…

301
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,100
I made…

302
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,040
I made a friend.

303
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,609
Amigo?

304
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,320
Thank you.

305
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,093
You know what?

306
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,429
I like the head of <i>taiyaki</i> best.

307
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,266
Oh, is that right?

308
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,337
When I eat the head,

309
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,574
I feel happy.

310
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,642
I'm not sure why though.

311
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,716
Did your friend give you this?

312
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,793
I see. So you made a friend.

313
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,963
And Nobuta Power is selling well.

314
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,267
It's like everyone else
wants a part of you now.

315
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,569
It makes me sad.

316
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,342
I…

317
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,179
I don't think I've changed at all.

318
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,517
Kotani!

319
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,786
There you are.

320
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,954
Some girls are here asking for keychains.

321
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,257
-Okay.
-Let's go.

322
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,098
Who cares about that.

323
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,702
But some girls want them.

324
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,574
Okay.

325
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:04,083
I guess producing means making something
that everyone wants a part of.

326
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,821
But that doesn't help me.

327
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,623
Right?

328
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,137
-Yo!
-Yo!

329
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,373
-Is Akira here?
-He'll be home soon.

330
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,908
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

331
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,177
Sorry about the other day.

332
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,745
No problem.

333
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,282
As usual, father-son arguments are
brutal in your family.

334
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,284
So…

335
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:41,987
What is this?

336
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,391
Akira's selling these at school,
200 yen each.

337
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,927
What? Two hundred yen for this?

338
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,562
That's better than my business.

339
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,966
The same price as tofu,
but these are selling like hotcakes.

340
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,301
Unbelievable, isn't it?

341
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,336
Ouch!

342
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,937
Damn it!

343
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,172
Ouch!

344
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:07,913
Lately,

345
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,017
even I can tell that I'm short-tempered.

346
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:19,024
Maybe you're not getting enough
carpaccio… I mean, calcium.

347
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,429
I've had to lay off some people
that I've worked with forever.

348
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,032
You know,

349
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,468
I've gotten sick of my job.

350
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,207
But you want your son
to follow in your footsteps into it.

351
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,276
It can't be helped.

352
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,077
Companies, you know,

353
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,515
they get into trouble over who it
passes down to and some go under.

354
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:48,921
They say the sooner you let everyone know
who'll take over, the better.

355
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,491
I'm home!

356
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,825
Welcome home.

357
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,629
What're you doing here, Dad? You're back?

358
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,064
You're annoying me.

359
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,466
How can you call me annoying?

360
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,468
I'm here
because you won't give me an answer!

361
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,337
I told you, I'm not working there!

362
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,573
How dare you say that, you punk?

363
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,942
I took over my dad's company and grew it!

364
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,944
Now it's your turn to make it even bigger!

365
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,545
You can't tell me what to do!

366
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,614
-Right, Mr. Hirayama?
-Don't start a fight.

367
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,450
If you don't take over after me,
it makes us look bad!

368
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:22,521
-How come you can't understand that?
-Ouch! That hurt!

369
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,389
Now I'm ticked off!

370
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,824
Damn you!

371
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,727
Now I'm ticked off again!

372
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,968
Ouch! You jerk! Cut that out!

373
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,710
You give up?

374
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:48,080
-You jerk!
-Not yet! Damn it!

375
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,217
Unbelievable.

376
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,591
Even dropping tofu
wouldn't make such a mess.

377
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,399
Talk about having a fall.

378
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,505
It's not like
I expect you to do anything right away.

379
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,512
I'm just asking you
to make up your mind about the future.

380
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,719
That's something that I can't decide yet.

381
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,995
I mean, I'm only 17.

382
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:45,237
There are still
decades and decades left in my life.

383
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,774
Why do I have to decide right now?

384
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,181
It's just way too cruel.

385
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,426
Wow!

386
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,162
This is major.

387
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,564
"Major"? You mean 10,000 yen?

388
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,535
-100,000 yen.
-What?

389
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,170
-They're selling that well?
-Yes.

390
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,439
-These little pieces of scrap?
-Yes.

391
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,309
Students from other schools
are coming to buy them too.

392
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,912
Let me have one of these.

393
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,247
-Sure. Take as many as you like.
-All right!

394
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,119
But don't you dare forget to advertise.

395
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:35,987
You bet.

396
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,556
You bet.

397
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,790
You bet.

398
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,160
All right!
Things are going to get even better!

399
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,397
Looks like you're enjoying this.

400
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,565
It does?

401
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,434
You might make a good businessman.

402
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,672
No way.

403
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,639
I'm serious.

404
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,640
No way.

405
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,541
Totally serious.

406
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,545
"Late in the month of February,
when the winds blew like a gale,

407
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,281
and the sky dark as the pit..."

408
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,618
A businessman?

409
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,757
MEETING ROOM

410
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,592
-Mr. Yokoyama!
-Yes?

411
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,994
When are you going to get rid of this?

412
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,529
Oh, that?

413
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,365
I don't think
I can ever get rid of it. Sorry.

414
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,369
-What? What the heck is in here anyway?
-Don't!

415
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,905
No! Don't open it!

416
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,208
What in the world is this?

417
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:34,079
This is the book of poems I published
a long time ago, but it never sold.

418
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,481
I was going to throw them away,

419
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,951
but they're memories from my youth,
so I couldn't bring myself to.

420
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:44,723
"A used-up pocket warmer
will never warm up again."

421
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,625
No! Please, stop it!

422
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,828
Fine! I'll throw them out!
I'll throw them all away!

423
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,732
<i>DISPOSABLE POCKET WARMERS</i>
BY TAKESHI YOKOYAMA

424
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,817
You don't write this stuff anymore?

425
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:13,985
No.

426
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,155
I haven't written anything at all.

427
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,226
Poems, you know, don't make money.

428
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,163
So making a living was more important.

429
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,669
Yes, I guess you could say that.

430
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,506
Do you regret it?

431
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,676
No, I don't.

432
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,444
Not at all?

433
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:45,851
You may not believe it,
but I really enjoy the job I have now.

434
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,956
Want to put this in my shop?

435
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,558
You're kidding.

436
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,263
Ouch!

437
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:04,169
Shuji, how much are our sales?

438
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,170
Hold on.

439
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,938
-Hurry up.
-Seriously?

440
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,240
No way! Holy cow!

441
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,342
-Show me!
-No.

442
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,845
-Don't get too surprised. Okay? Stay calm.
-Okay.

443
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:14,880
Voilà!

444
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,215
-Awesome, right?
-Awesome!

445
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,921
You sure sound excited.

446
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,589
What are you guys talking about?

447
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,493
Oh, it's money?

448
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,162
Don't worry.

449
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,932
I won't be so stupid
as to tell you to stop.

450
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,635
I only came to buy one of those keychains.

451
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,769
I'll take one.

452
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,705
Sorry, but we're sold out right now.

453
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,608
Then this is to reserve one
when you've got more.

454
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,809
Thank you!

455
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,950
You kids, do you know
which is the front of this coin?

456
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,220
Isn't it obvious?

457
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,188
It's this side.

458
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,824
It figures you'd say that.

459
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,761
Actually,
the cherry-blossom side is the front,

460
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:07,365
but for some reason, now everyone thinks
the number side is the front.

461
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,334
The cherry blossoms are the front?

462
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,003
We'd like to think
the pretty side is on the front,

463
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:17,075
but in the real world,
things don't always work out that way.

464
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,912
You youngsters obsessed with money!

465
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,716
Don't you dare ever forget that

466
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,886
money has a front side and a back side.

467
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,289
Got it?

468
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,406
Hey.

469
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,877
This one is different
than the ones you make, isn't it?

470
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,146
Yes.

471
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,748
Then it's a fake.

472
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,450
A fake?

473
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,019
I heard that these ones are 150 yen.

474
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,192
I checked it out.

475
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,695
They are made by students
at some other school.

476
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:15,634
They are clearly a copy of our Nobuta.

477
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,270
I never thought there'd be knock-offs.

478
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,942
"It's your fault
that I don't sell anymore!"

479
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,778
That's why our sales have plummeted.

480
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,881
What a pain in the neck.

481
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,051
I mean, ours is the original.

482
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,223
Maybe we should just forget it.

483
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,328
It already made everyone happy.

484
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,396
I don't like it!

485
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,932
I mean, why are we letting this
get the better of us?

486
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,468
I don't like it either.

487
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,836
I know what to do.

488
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,774
We'll take all the money we've made
and make a better version.

489
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,643
Nice. Let's make one
better than anyone else's!

490
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,811
That's right.

491
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,150
I won't let this garbage
get the better of us!

492
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,885
"I won't stand for it!"

493
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,953
"I won't stand for it!"

494
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,757
I can understand not wanting to give in.

495
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:14,559
Right?

496
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,831
That's what your father felt
when he ran away from home too.

497
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,400
Ran away from home?

498
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,269
My dad did?

499
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,438
What? You don't remember that?

500
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,239
Not at all.

501
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,610
He couldn't stand to
work for his father's company,

502
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,916
so he took you and his wife,
ran away and came to live here.

503
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,384
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

504
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,653
<i>Then what happened?</i>

505
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,025
<i>Neither me nor your dad had any money,
so the four of us ate nothing but tofu.</i>

506
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,228
I don't remember that at all.

507
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,666
Your dad looked all over for work.

508
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,036
But he realized
he couldn't support his family,

509
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,606
so he went back to his dad
and asked to work at his company.

510
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,746
I've…

511
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,517
lost to a lack of money.

512
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,888
<i>He left home
because he didn't want to give in,</i>

513
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,791
<i>but ultimately your dad gave in</i>

514
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,193
and had to return.

515
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,500
That's hot.

516
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,470
Come on. Over here.

517
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,013
-Wow.
-Wow.

518
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,181
NOBUTA KEYCHAIN NEW VERSION

519
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,784
<i>Let's make one that's better than before.</i>

520
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,719
Hurry up! Come on!

521
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:52,891
PIG POWERED

522
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,826
<i>That was our thought</i>

523
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,463
<i>when we made this to get revenge
on whoever made those fakes.</i>

524
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,967
They're here, amigo.

525
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,609
Awesome!

526
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,481
<i>Our sales goal was 500,000 yen.</i>

527
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,551
<i>I swear we'll achieve it.</i>

528
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,959
It's really cute!

529
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,161
It grants your every wish!

530
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,263
You haven't sold any at all.

531
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,300
It's because you got so cocky, idiots!

532
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,337
If you feel bad for us,
then give us your money!

533
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,773
Business is thriving!

534
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,308
What's this? A new version?

535
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,144
-That's right.
-Wow! This new version sure is cute!

536
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,247
-The new version!
-Wow! It's so cute!

537
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,583
-Hey, you got the new version yet?
-No.

538
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,419
This is the new version.
What will you wish for this time?

539
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,454
Shuji, want to go to karaoke today?

540
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,690
Yes! Let's sing to blow off steam!

541
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,657
-Karaoke?
-Yes.

542
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,292
-Karaoke? Sure thing!
-Really?

543
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,527
-You bet.
-Same place?

544
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,561
-Okay.
-Be there!

545
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,897
-Want the new version? No?
-You still doing this?

546
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,065
We sure are.

547
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,069
-This is the new version.
-No thanks. I'm good.

548
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,637
-Are you sure? It's new.
-It's okay.

549
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,605
Hang in there.

550
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,710
-Wow! This new version is really cute!
-New version on sale.

551
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,312
-This must have just come out.
-Yes, it just did.

552
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,548
-It's the new star.
-Wow! It's so cute!

553
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,084
And there's hardly any!
First come, first served!

554
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,285
It's so darn cute! Wow!

555
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,588
There's still a ton left.

556
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,228
Let me rub it and make it better!

557
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,969
And this one is
way better than the last one.

558
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,738
Why isn't it selling?

559
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,108
Everyone's sick of them.

560
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,777
But that wouldn't explain all of it.

561
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,180
This makes no sense.

562
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,715
You getting enough calcium?

563
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,920
If they're sick of it,
then just live with it.

564
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,421
Right?

565
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,438
Shuji!

566
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,507
Hi.

567
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,709
You okay?

568
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,743
Why do you ask?

569
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,880
I heard the new keychain isn't selling.

570
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,816
Well, it's not that bad.

571
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,721
-I'll buy one.
-No, it's okay.

572
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,057
-But you need to sell them, right?
-Just forget it!

573
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,092
What?

574
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,429
It's okay.

575
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,069
PIG POWERED

576
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,670
I lost my cool.

577
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,940
I'm not my normal self.

578
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,344
I'm a total freaking jerk.

579
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,050
I never should have
put so much effort into this.

580
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,357
I seriously should have gone easy on this.

581
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,093
Then if we failed, I could laugh it off.

582
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,765
And I never would have acted
like I did with Mariko.

583
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,646
There's nothing wrong
with trying very hard.

584
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,951
But it sucks if it's a failure.

585
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,553
But…

586
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,191
it may have given some people hope.

587
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,961
Like people who wished for things.

588
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,932
That doesn't count for anything.

589
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:04,442
Is sales of 100,000 yen
or selling 1,000 all that counts?

590
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,419
Yes, it is.

591
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,056
Stuff like giving people hope

592
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,959
is just wishful thinking
and only helps to ease your conscience.

593
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,964
Everyone!

594
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,770
We've been screwed again.

595
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,671
Bang!

596
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,278
Whoever did this is an idiot.

597
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:46,784
It doesn't matter if paint gets dumped
on stuff we couldn't sell anyway.

598
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:52,223
I have no idea why
anyone wants to do this kind of thing.

599
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,995
It's probably good this happened.

600
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:58,896
What?

601
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,968
I mean,
now we can move on to the next thing.

602
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:10,108
We need to move on.

603
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,144
Right?

604
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,725
I'm home, Mr. Hirayama.

605
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,659
Hey!

606
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,728
What? You're here again?

607
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,530
Where's Mr. Hirayama?

608
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,698
Making deliveries.

609
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,066
I see.

610
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,334
Wait!

611
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,502
I want to talk.

612
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,505
About what?

613
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,709
About taking over after me.

614
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,311
You…

615
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,781
don't have to do it.

616
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:51,682
What?

617
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,051
Why?

618
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,121
Good question.

619
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,992
Look at this.

620
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,330
This is the world that I live in.

621
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,367
The 10,000-yen bills are all together.

622
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,836
The 100-yen coins are together.
The 1-yen coins are together.

623
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,438
They're nicely organized.

624
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,874
They're split into their compartments.

625
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:21,012
The 10,000-yen bills can't fit in
with the 100-yen or 1-yen coins.

626
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,584
All the 10,000-yen bills
are with their kind.

627
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,555
From the outside,
it's a pretty dull-looking world.

628
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,361
You don't have to enter it yet.

629
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:44,268
You keep on being a ten-yen coin
sitting on the side of the road.

630
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,757
Okay.

631
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,662
What is it?

632
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:46,897
Come with me!

633
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:47,798
Where?

634
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,634
Good morning!

635
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,537
Both of you, come with me!

636
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,473
School's about to start.

637
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,108
That doesn't matter. Come with me!

638
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,376
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

639
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,378
Nobuta.

640
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,381
What's wrong?

641
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,516
Dig here.

642
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,417
What?

643
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,386
Arf-arf!

644
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,298
There's something here.

645
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,202
I think it's someone's treasure box.

646
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,047
This brings back memories.

647
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,749
I had one of these as a kid.

648
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,161
Look at this.

649
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,598
Something that we made

650
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,536
was a precious treasure to someone.

651
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,543
It remained special in their hearts.

652
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,148
To me, that's enough.

653
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,687
I'm glad we worked so hard to make them.

654
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,066
<i>It's just like Nobuta said.</i>

655
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,573
<i>"We need to move on. Right?"</i>

656
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,690
Here. That end has more bean jam.

657
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,665
What's your treasure, Dad?

658
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,137
That would be you.

659
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,709
When you eat the head of <i>taiyaki…</i>

660
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,148
doesn't it make you feel happy?

661
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:19,817
No.

662
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:21,786
Right?

663
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,220
Yes.

664
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,456
I feel normal.

665
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,491
I see.

666
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,961
I guess it's just me.

667
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,464
All right.

668
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,576
DISPOSABLE POCKET WARMERS
BY TAKESHI YOKOYAMA

669
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,213
<i>Mr. Yokoyama's book of poetry
was sold at Goyokudo</i>

670
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,715
<i>and he enjoyed a brief boom.</i>

671
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,852
"The white rose is
a flower of the rose family."

672
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,955
"White Okuda is the son
of an ear and nose doctor."

673
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,058
-The title is <i>Mirage</i>!
-<i>Mirage</i>?

674
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,693
Why is that so funny?

675
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,934
-Was there one that funny in it?
-Okuda!

676
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,974
Well, as long as people enjoy it.

677
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,179
Whoever hasn't handed in
the post-graduation survey, hand them in.

678
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,114
-Here!
-You haven't written it?

679
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,116
Bring them forward.

680
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,184
<i>Like I thought,</i>

681
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,954
<i>I couldn't decide my future</i>

682
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,523
<i>in just a week.</i>

683
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,962
MEETING ROOM

684
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,866
"Theater."

685
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,467
Yes, she does like theater.

686
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,035
POST-GRADUATION SURVEY

687
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,042
"A ten-yen coin on the side of the road.
Akira Kusano."

688
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,653
"Live a happy life. Nobuko Kotani."

689
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,458
"Become a proper human.

690
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,594
Shuji Kiritani."

691
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,997
What's with these guys?

692
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,734
I can't tell if they're being facetious…

693
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,840
or serious.

694
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,409
LIVE A HAPPY LIFE.
NOBUKO KOTANI

695
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,511
A TEN-YEN COIN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
AKIRA KUSANO

696
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,647
BECOME A PROPER HUMAN.
SHUJI KIRITANI

697
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:44,595
<i>While these people work at their jobs,</i>

698
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,600
<i> they probably also feel disappointed
or happy, or love someone special.</i>

699
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,152
You know what?

700
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,989
I want to quit being a producer.

701
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,190
Is that right?

702
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,094
What? Why?

703
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,998
It's too painful for me.

704
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,069
"Too painful"?

705
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,307
For Nobuta to belong
to everyone is painful for me.

706
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,210
What do you mean?

707
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,351
I want Nobuta to be mine alone.

708
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,457
To be honest,
I don't like anyone looking at her.

709
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,966
<i>What's going on inside someone's mind</i>

710
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,837
<i>is way beyond anything I can ever imagine.</i>

711
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,673
Hold on here.

712
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,375
<i>Nobuta! I love you!</i>

713
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,514
<i>Today is the last day
of the Nobuta production project.</i>

714
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:56,086
