1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,905
<i>What's going on inside someone's mind,</i>

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:07,907
<i>or more exactly, in his mind,</i>

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,811
<i>was way beyond anything
I could ever imagine.</i>

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,780
I want to quit being a producer.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,320
For Nobuta to belong
to everyone is painful for me.

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,592
I want Nobuta to be mine alone.

7
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,497
<i>To be honest,
I don't like anyone looking at her.</i>

8
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,187
Yip yip.

9
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,891
What the heck is he here for?

10
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,064
He's totally ticked off too.

11
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,832
That hurts!

12
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,005
Let me just make doubly sure.

13
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,009
You're really quitting
being a producer for Nobuta?

14
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:18,845
Yes.

15
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,480
Then

16
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,316
what do you want to do with Nobuta?

17
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,851
What do I want?

18
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,397
What do I want?

19
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:42,635
You want to confess your love and take her
on a date to the zoo or something?

20
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,173
Yes, I'd like to do that too.

21
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,977
But what I want to do most of all is…

22
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,246
I'm not sure I should say this.

23
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,449
Marry her.

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,252
I'm so embarrassed!

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,689
<i>I knew it.</i>

26
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,992
<i>He's gone way beyond
anything I could ever have imagined.</i>

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,339
The broadcasting club?

28
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,642
Aoi invited me to join it.

29
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,212
Oh, you want to join a club?

30
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,181
That could be a good idea.

31
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,251
Sure, why not?

32
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,052
You'll meet more people too.

33
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,723
Club activities are so stupid.

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,260
-Meeting people is such a pain.
-It's perfect.

35
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,462
I think it's really perfect.

36
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,798
Besides, I was thinking of
taking a break producing for you.

37
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,735
Why…

38
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,774
Why?

39
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,076
Well, you've made a friend,

40
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,880
and if we're always hanging around you,
you'll never achieve independence.

41
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,815
-Right?
-Right.

42
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,053
Don't worry.
We'll help you if you ever need it.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,054
Right.

44
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,223
And we'll figure out
who's been harassing you.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,291
Right.

46
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,594
Why the worried look?

47
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,165
Don't worry about it, okay?
It will be fine.

48
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,434
I'll…

49
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,171
miss you guys.

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,076
Don't be silly. We're in the same class.

51
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,277
We'll see you every day.

52
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,051
This is stupid.
I'll join the broadcast club too.

53
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,953
-Want to join too, Shuji?
-What for?

54
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,757
Okay! Avocado! A, E, I, O, U!

55
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,360
Love and courage are my only friends!
Repeat!

56
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,997
Avocado. A, E, I, O, U.

57
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,736
-Avocado. A, E, I, O, U.
-Good.

58
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,005
Love and courage are my only friends! Go!

59
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,907
Hey!

60
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,480
<i>So today was…</i>

61
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,684
<i>the last day…</i>

62
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,090
<i>of the Nobuta production project.</i>

63
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,828
-Eight days a week, hello!
-Hello!

64
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,891
<i>The three of us will
never do anything together again.</i>

65
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,808
These are new members, Kusano and Kotani.

66
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,877
I'm Akira! Nice to meet you!

67
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,515
Nice to meet you.

68
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,186
Have a seat over there.

69
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:01,127
Today, we'll discuss our submission
for the National Broadcasting Competition.

70
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,897
I have a question. Are the sophomores
going to submit something again this year?

71
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,966
-Shuji!
-Do you want to, Aoi?

72
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,635
Well, there are only two new members…

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,174
It's been ages since you last came!

74
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,988
Hey,
let's really start raging with that song.

75
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,757
-You know. That one.
-That one?

76
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,792
-That one.
-Oh, that one!

77
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,811
<i>This is so boring.</i>

78
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,985
<i>Since when was karaoke so boring?</i>

79
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,062
<i>I'm worried about tomorrow.</i>

80
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,731
Are we doing something?

81
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,902
We're going to film something
to play during lunchtime.

82
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,937
We are?

83
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:23,476
Yes. I'm not sure
I'm the right person to be the reporter.

84
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,677
You're the reporter?

85
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,081
Well,
you're the assistant director, right?

86
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,283
No, I'm not.

87
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,451
What?

88
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,819
I'm the assistant director?

89
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,424
You weren't listening at all, were you?

90
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:41,894
No way!

91
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,032
Okay! Whoever is the most ridiculous

92
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,469
gets the right to eat
this last piece of melon.

93
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,003
Most ridiculous?

94
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,408
I mean, whoever throws
the biggest tantrum wins.

95
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,509
You're kidding.

96
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,344
Okay, kid. Do it.

97
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,046
Go.

98
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,781
Okay!

99
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,915
Dang it!

100
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,019
-Why the heck am I shorter than Watanabe?
-Who's Watanabe?

101
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,222
-Watanabe's a girl, right?
-A girl?

102
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,357
You sure have small dreams, kid.

103
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,926
Shuji, you throw a tantrum too.

104
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,228
-Yes.
-What? Me?

105
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,563
No thanks. I don't want the melon.

106
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,766
Come to think of it,
you never threw a tantrum as a kid.

107
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,001
Really? You didn't?

108
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,004
I'm not sure why,
but you've always been reasonable.

109
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,273
Can I go then?

110
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,408
-You'll do it?
-I want to see that!

111
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,515
I don't want to go to work!

112
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,719
I can't stand my boss!

113
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,289
Throw a tantrum?

114
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,070
Being a liar is harsh!

115
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,741
I don't know why, but it's so painful!

116
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,382
It really is suffocating.

117
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:16,923
I'm now going to try…

118
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,725
rolling noodles.

119
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,665
I'm ready.

120
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,199
-Ouch!
-Get to work!

121
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,502
-Get rid of those kids out there.
-Right!

122
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,409
Hey!

123
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,320
Shuji!

124
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,354
Shuji!

125
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,189
-What's wrong?
-With what?

126
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,857
You're not your usual self.

127
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,059
You think so?

128
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,194
-Let's see some spirit!
-Okay.

129
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,996
Tani! You're next.

130
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,164
All right!

131
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,167
<i>My usual self?</i>

132
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,436
<i>What is that?</i>

133
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,377
<i>Is it like this?</i>

134
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,252
<i>This is the Sumidagawa High
lunchtime broadcast.</i>

135
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,855
It's Kotani! Kotani's on TV!

136
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,996
-Can she even talk?
-She's hopeless.

137
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,831
-<i>This is Towada Soba.</i>
-She's talking!

138
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,033
-Wow! She's talking!
-She's talking!

139
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,570
<i>This is an old restaurant
that's been around for 80 years.</i>

140
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,573
Isn't it cute, the way Kotani moves?

141
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,608
Yes, it is kind of cute!

142
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,043
Whoa! She fell!

143
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,578
She tripped?

144
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,581
-<i>I'm sorry!</i>
-That's so cute!

145
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,320
Are you sure you want that much wasabi?

146
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,888
That's going to be way too hot!

147
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,725
Didn't I tell you?

148
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,495
-Kotani really is hopeless!
-<i>It's delicious.</i>

149
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,430
She's having seconds!

150
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,067
Shuji!

151
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,637
Shuji!

152
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,242
Kotani's on TV now. It's Kotani.

153
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,243
Come in.

154
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,514
-Come in here and watch!
-Mariko! In here!

155
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,216
Can I wait until this is over?

156
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,324
<i>That is all for Sumidagawa High's
lunchtime broadcast.</i>

157
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,562
<i>This has been Nobuko Kotani reporting.</i>

158
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,597
That hurts!

159
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,734
-That was really great!
-That was wonderful!

160
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,837
-Awesome!
-Way to go, Kotani! You're awesome!

161

BROADCASTING ROOM

162
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,570
That hurts!

163
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,409
Nobuta.

164
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:24,944
Yes?

165
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,382
I… You see…

166
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,283
I…

167
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,686
The aquarium was fun, wasn't it?

168
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,021
I…

169
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,923
I…

170
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,425
I…

171
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,393
Shuji.

172
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,097
Was I interrupting?

173
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,166
No, not at all.

174
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,807
So how are the club activities?

175
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,244
It's going all right.

176
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,254
I saw the soba shop report. That was cool.

177
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,192
Everyone in class,
they were applauding at the end.

178
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,562
I wish you could have seen it.

179
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,802
That's all I wanted to say.

180
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,303
Then why don't you go?

181
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,271
Okay.

182
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,375
-Bye.
-The exit is that way.

183
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,710
-Wait.
-What?

184
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,116
There's a competition coming up.

185
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,253
I don't know how I should film for it.

186
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,124
You want me to show you how to film?

187
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,625
Yes.

188
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,432
Incidentally,

189
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,367
what's the theme?

190
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,369
Something that I like.

191
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,838
Something you like?

192
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,808
Let's go film it together sometime.

193
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,410
Good idea! Count me in!

194
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,744
You're coming too?

195
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,847
You'd better believe it. I'm in this club!

196
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,615
And the last number is three!

197
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,183
-Three?
-Yes!

198
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,185
-We did it!
-Yahoo!

199
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,688
We won the lottery? How much?

200
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,057
Three million yen!

201
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,726
-Three million yen!
-Yahoo!

202
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,963
And including Head Teacher Sada,
we split it five ways.

203
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,599
-That's 600,000 yen each!
-Yes!

204
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,502
-Mr. Yokoyama! Get the tickets!
-Right!

205
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,737
Get the tickets!

206
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,973
Okay! Calm down!

207
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,046
Three million yen!

208
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,481
Three million yen!

209
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,849
Three million yen!

210
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,251
Three million yen!

211
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,187
Hurry up! Three million yen!

212
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,296
What's the matter?

213
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,434
No way!

214
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,904
This is useless!

215
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,742
Is this ball of trash 300,000 yen?

216
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,876
Yes…

217
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,212
You're kidding!

218
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,183
So who's going to tell Head Teacher Sada?

219
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,330
What?

220
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,365
Do you hear cicadas?

221
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,970
There aren't cicadas this time of year.
That's not a cicada.

222
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,407
An autumn cicada would be a huge scoop!

223
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,010
Whoa!

224
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,212
Delphine.

225
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,717
What the heck's the point of
a cicada living until fall?

226
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,652
You must be lonely!

227
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,854
Give it up, would you?

228
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,024
Plop.

229
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,225
Nice!

230
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,499
For both cicadas and humans,
knowing when to give up is crucial.

231
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,975
May you go to hell.

232
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,847
Excuse me! What are you doing?

233
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,784
I'm putting a curse on that damn Yokoyama!

234
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:30,022
-Putting a curse on him?
-The lottery tickets we bought won.

235
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,323
Three million yen!

236
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,858
Really? Wow!

237
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:37,629
But that damn Yokoyama
washed the tickets with his laundry!

238
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,966
May he go to the grave!

239
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,702
You can eat these.

240
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,171
They've got ground shrimp in them.

241
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,473
They're good!

242
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,377
-You like it?
-It's great!

243
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,850
The head is delicious.

244
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,218
-Good.
-You're right!

245
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,953
Yokoyama's head is great!

246
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,055
Hear that, Yokoyama. You taste good.

247
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,558
So you want to split up and film?

248
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,261
Then I'll go over there.

249
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,697
Yip.

250
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,306
We're totally going to win first prize.

251
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,355
When do I give up?

252
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,256
Yes.

253
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,659
Anything is fine.
It can be stupid. It doesn't matter.

254
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm actually the kind of person
who doesn't give up.

255
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,837
I mean, if you give up,

256
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,173
you'll regret it later.

257
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,543
What are you doing?

258
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,211
What?

259
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,746
Do you know Ishizaka?

260
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,147
Ishizaka?

261
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,716
A senior?

262
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,485
Yes.

263
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,623
Apparently, he likes me.

264
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,128
What? That Ishizaka guy does?

265
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,764
He asked me if you and I were dating.

266
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,868
I didn't know

267
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,437
what to tell him.

268
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,111
Are you and I a couple?

269
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,481
You should turn Ishizaka down.

270
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,316
He's got a really bad reputation.

271
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,752
I heard he's always cheating on girls.
I wouldn't--

272
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,755
Are you going to
avoid the question again like usual?

273
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,293
There's something wrong
if you can't say if you're a couple.

274
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,697
It's not right.

275
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,338
The way things are, it's painful for me.

276
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,743
Isn't it painful for you too?

277
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,199
Wait! You're filming
the video for the competition?

278
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,002
Okay, go ahead.
You can film me. Go right ahead.

279
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,876
-Film me!
-What?

280
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,645
-Film me!
-Yay!

281
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,413
Film me!

282
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,549
-Film me!
-What's going on?

283
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,449
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

284
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,820
Nice! They've got
some really nice cameras nowadays!

285
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,458
-First, let's look at Akira's.
-Okay.

286
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,160
-There.
-Let's watch!

287
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,765
What's this? The school?

288
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,034
I don't remember this place.

289
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,035
I bet you don't.

290
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,303
This is cool.

291
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,307
It looks like a dog filmed this.

292
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,243
Did you hear that?
She said it's cool. All right!

293
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,179
Next, Nobuta's.

294
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,315
Here goes.

295
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,751
His face is cut off,
but that has got to be Yokoyama.

296
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,020
He's pulling up his pants,
so it's definitely him.

297
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,389
This is hilarious!

298
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,658
-What are you filming?
-What are you filming?

299
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,394
-Darn you. Enough!
-This is so silly!

300
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,999
What? You're going to give up on this?

301
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,801
Yes.

302
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,939
-Then let's watch the next one.
-Okay.

303
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,007
There.

304
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,742
Nice!

305
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,776
Okay!

306
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,479
You guys are at the peak of youth! Next…

307
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,381
Boom! Boom! Boom!

308
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,549
Boom!

309
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,118
Okay? Oh, I'm too busy for this.

310
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,254
There you go. Sorry.

311
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,626
-Next, my video.
-Okay.

312
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,827
There.

313
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,061
Here goes.

314
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>-Quit filming me!
-Shut that off!</i>

315
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,737
-<i>Film me!</i>
-It's dull and lacks rhythm.

316
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,071
-<i>Film me!</i>
-You think so?

317
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,440
It completely lacks surprise!

318
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,943
It's dull!

319
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,111
It's cool.

320
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,647
What?

321
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,181
This is cool?

322
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,285
It's really interesting.

323
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,953
It's totally ordinary.

324
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,622
We should focus on a theme.

325
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,823
Really?

326
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,792
-Maybe so.
-No, we don't need to.

327
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,428
I know it's pretty ordinary.

328
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,063
It's totally ordinary.

329
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,231
Economy class level.

330
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,233
Not at all.

331
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,902
What? Yes, it is. It's totally dull.

332
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,109
All you've been looking at
is what Shuji filmed.

333
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,645
Yes.

334
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,050
Every time I watch it, I like it more.

335
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,185
Like? Like what?

336
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,057
Did you realize
that he only filmed people?

337
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,127
What he likes are people.

338
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:15,133
That's cool, isn't it?
He looks so cold, but he likes people.

339
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:21,940
I bet he's the type who really cares
for the people in his life.

340
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,344
For them, he's willing to lie

341
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,048
and he puts up with all kinds of things.

342
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,885
Watching this, I can tell.

343
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,999
I'll go and get my bag.

344
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,892
There!

345
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,942
Akira is down!

346
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,577
I'm sorry!

347
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:09,147
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

348
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,250
I'll go get someone!

349
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,489
I'm bleeding a lot.

350
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,642
Sorry. You guys keep on going. Bicycle!

351
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,144
What's wrong?

352
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,813
My fist… With my fist…

353
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,686
I heard she hit you with her fist.

354
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,689
I was KO'd.

355
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,193
I'll buy ice.

356
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,065
I bet

357
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,134
it doesn't hurt anymore.

358
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,135
It hurts.

359
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,205
My heart hurts.

360
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:13,144
Well, when the girl you like punches you,
I bet it does hurt.

361
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,752
I tried to

362
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,859
throw away the video that you shot.

363
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,327
What?

364
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,597
The video Nobuta worked
so hard on to edit…

365
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,301
I tried to throw it away.

366
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,073
I'm a scumbag.

367
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,979
A total scumbag.

368
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,165
Smile, would you?

369
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,367
More.

370
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,273
I wonder if I should give up.

371
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,811
You've really become negative.

372
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,381
But I can't give up completely.

373
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,217
Do you really think

374
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,354
Nobuta would hate you for just this?

375
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,389
Do you?

376
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,760
I mean,
surely you must realize that, right?

377
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,531
But I'm a scumbag, man.

378
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,676
I'm a scumbag too.

379
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:15,266
I really am sorry.

380
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,202
No.

381
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:23,808
I'm the one who's to blame the most.

382
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,079
But there was no reason to punch you.

383
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,785
You know what?

384
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,690
When I found someone that I love,

385
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,862
I intended to
always live happily with that person.

386
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,732
But…

387
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,269
when you do live together…

388
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,173
there will be

389
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,212
days like today
where I'll end up making them cry.

390
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,719
I don't want to make them cry…

391
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,525
but I guess I'll end up making them cry.

392
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,076
Next is the video filmed by Shuji Kiritani
and edited by Nobuko Kotani.

393
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,377
Go ahead, Kotani.

394
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:47,025
WHAT I LIKE

395
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,597
<i>All right. Fine. I give up.</i>

396
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,933
<i>You can film me. Make me look good.</i>

397
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:00,472
<i>Oh, the lottery?
Yes, well. I gave up on that.</i>

398
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,776
<i>I know it's too much to ask to make me
look pretty. I've given up on that.</i>

399
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,444
<i>As for marriage, I haven't given…</i>

400
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,948
<i>When you give up, that means game over!</i>

401
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,151
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

402
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,121
<i>Well, it's important not to give up.</i>

403
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,022
<i>What about me?</i>

404
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,558
<i>Well, there are things I've given up on.</i>

405
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,562
<i>I'm still working on it!</i>

406
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,700
<i>"Give up on it this time."</i>

407
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,235
<i>I gave up on that.</i>

408
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,705
<i>I'm actually the kind of person
who doesn't give up.</i>

409
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,407
<i>You'll regret it later.</i>

410
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,743
<i>I can't give up completely,</i>

411
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,311
<i>but I'll give it up!</i>

412
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,181
<i>Rest in peace!</i>

413
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,285
<i>Nobuta power charge!</i>

414
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,991
<i>But I can't give up completely.</i>

415
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,560
<i>You're going to give up on this?</i>

416
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,262
<i>Yes.</i>

417
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,499
<i>Then let's watch the next one.</i>

418
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,636
YOKOYAMA

419
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,738
What do you think of it?

420
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,306
I liked it.

421
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,675
-Yes, me too.
-I think it should be a candidate.

422
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,076
You're right.

423
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,280
Kotani, keep up the good work.

424
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,930
Okay. See you.

425
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,599
Bye.

426
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,915
WHAT I LIKE

427
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,271
Excuse me...

428
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,909
That's the tape you edited, isn't it?

429
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,319
Whoever did this knew it was
Kotani's when they did it, right?

430
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,254
Yes, probably so.

431
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,539
Are you all right?

432
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,109
I'm sorry.

433
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,246
Why are you apologizing?

434
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,216
Never mind me.

435
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,723
What bothers me is

436
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,727
how people can express
their feelings in such a cruel way.

437
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,066
You just can,

438
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,402
when you're desperate.

439
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,408
I did the same.

440
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,690
Okay.

441
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,626
I'm giving up.

442
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,594
What?

443
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,298
I'm giving up on getting Nobuta.

444
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,735
Seriously?

445
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,938
I don't have the right
to be in love with Nobuta.

446
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,507
The right to be in love?

447
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,213
I don't think you need the right
to fall in love with someone.

448
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,648
Yes, you do.

449
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,852
You should never

450
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,421
make a girl cry.

451
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,558
The way I am now,

452
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,894
I don't have that right.

453
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,902
I like Nobuta best
when the three of us are together.

454
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,304
I love her like that.

455
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,380
There's no school tomorrow, is there?

456
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,283
That's right.

457
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,319
Okay.

458
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,021
Then

459
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,124
let's give up properly.

460
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,414
ON AIR

461
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,382
Yip!

462
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,583
Yip!

463
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,733
Nobuta!

464
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,069
I love you!

465
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,641
<i>I love the books that Nobuta reads.</i>

466
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,946
<i>I love the streets that Nobuta walks.</i>

467
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,583
<i>I love the roof where Nobuta is.</i>

468
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,420
<i>I love all the places where Nobuta is.</i>

469
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,723
I love them.

470
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:32,830
So it is for Nobuta that I will now sing.

471
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,308
<i>If on this ship I'm on</i>

472
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:49,647
<i>I find your happiness</i>

473
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,218
<i>I'll be home right away</i>

474
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,787
<i>Won't you be my wife</i>

475
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,556
Why the heck is he singing?

476
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,227
<i>On this moonless, desolate</i>

477
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,431
<i>Dark night</i>

478
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:13,371
<i>Your smile</i>

479
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,607
<i>Sings to me</i>

480
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,979
<i>When you see the ship</i>

481
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:26,784
<i>Come running in your wet body</i>

482
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,722
<i>This red ring of coral I made</i>

483
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:35,393
<i>I will give to you</i>

484
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,565
<i>If on this ship I'm on</i>

485
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,566
What is this?

486
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,568
I'm not sure.

487
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,772
What are you here for?

488
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,676
Oh, we've got
early morning basketball practice.

489
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,013
-Bye.
-Yes.

490
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,185
<i>Even the waves are dreaming</i>

491
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:05,356
<i>On the starlit night</i>

492
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,394
Mariko!

493
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,140
You asked me

494
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,645
if we really are a couple, right?

495
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,616
Actually,

496
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,185
until now,

497
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,624
I've never been in love with anyone.

498
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,462
So…

499
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,165
I've never thought

500
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:54,872
that I love you either, Mariko.

501
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,443
You see, romance and stuff like that,

502
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,615
I'm not comfortable
around things that I can't control.

503
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,220
I don't like them.

504
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,625
But

505
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,562
I wanted everyone…

506
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,034
to think that I had

507
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,370
a girlfriend.

508
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,973
That's why…

509
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,909
I ate your bento lunches

510
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,612
and stuff.

511
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,752
Will it always be like that?

512
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,989
Is there…

513
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,963
a possibility
that you'll ever fall in love with me?

514
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,236
No.

515
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,644
Sorry.

516
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,563
Can it be fixed?

517
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,631
What?

518
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:06,070
If we can get this tape
all back in the cassette.

519
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,046
Nobuta…

520
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,651
Is something wrong?

521
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,064
I said something awful to Mariko.

522
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,935
Starting tomorrow,

523
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,806
she'll probably hate my guts.

524
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,776
You know…

525
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,580
Being hated…

526
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,753
by others...

527
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,527
sure is terrifying.

528
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,353
It's okay.

529
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,290
Nobody

530
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,594
will hate you.

531
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,306
Sorry.

532
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,376
I'm sorry.

533
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,881
<i>I need to say something to Nobuta!</i>

534
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,254
<i>If I don't smile and say something,
it will make Nobuta worry!</i>

535
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,658
<i>Even though I thought that,</i>

536
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,762
<i>I couldn't move.</i>

537
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,747
<i>Nobuta power charge!</i>

538
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,675
<i>After Nobuta hugged me,
I, at last, realized…</i>

539
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,846
<i>that I am…</i>

540
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,418
<i>a lonely person.</i>

541
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,386
<i>Who runs away
when a friend is getting beat up?</i>

542
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,387
<i>Shuji's a scumbag.</i>

543
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,354
Wait a minute.

544
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,691
That's the kind of person I am.

545
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:33,197
