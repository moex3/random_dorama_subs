1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,370
<i>What? Friends?</i>

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,171
You mean close friends?

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,576
About three, I think.

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,444
Hold on a second.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,479
Hey, kid.

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,681
-Who is it?
-Mom.

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,516
Hurry up! It's an international call.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,156
Four, I guess.
One of them, I'm not sure about.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,759
Shuji.

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,994
-Me?
-It's Mom. Hurry up!

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,164
-Yes?
<i>-How many friends do you have?</i>

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,665
I've never really counted.

13
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,834
<i>-You don't have friends?</i>
-Yes, I do!

14
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,236
<i>Then how many?</i>

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,137
What?

16
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,808
-Hurry up! Time's running out!
-Fine! Two!

17
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,913
What was that all about?

18
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,750
So you've got two friends?

19
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,621
Oh, is that funny guy
who stayed here one of them?

20
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,389
That guy who's a karate expert.

21
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,225
Yip!

22
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,928
No, not him.

23
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,063
And who's the other?

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,965
I know! That girl!

25
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,034
-Oh, the keychain girl?
-Yes!

26
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,904
Nobuta power charge!

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,038
-Nobuta!
-Nobuta!

28
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,081
Is Nobuta your friend, Shuji?

29
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,717
Don't you call her Nobuta.

30
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,819
She's your friend, right?

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,655
She's your friend, right?

32
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,124
<i>Being hated…</i>

33
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,760
by others...

34
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,628
sure is terrifying.

35
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>It's okay.</i>

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,536
<i>Nobody will hate you.</i>

37
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,873
Is she?

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,408
-What?
-Is she?

39
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,442
Go to bed!

40
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,344
Hurry up!

41
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,679
Fine.

42
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,148
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

43
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,651
<i>Nobuta has been avoiding me.</i>

44
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,154
Nobuta…

45
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,394
<i>I know this can't last forever though.</i>

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,833
Nobuta!

47
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,514
<i>I guess,</i>

48
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,284
<i>my only choice is
to talk to her in the classroom.</i>

49
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,892
<i>Holy crap.</i>

50
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,528
<i>Everyone's watching.</i>

51
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,534
Well…

52
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,905
Wait! I need your help with something!
Catherine needs some help.

53
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,373
Morning four meters!

54
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,941
There it is! A new record!

55
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,309
Catherine needs some help.

56
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,250
I'll start being
your producer again, Nobuta.

57
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,887
That's all I wanted to tell you.

58
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,225
I'm through with being produced for.

59
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,126
What? Why?

60
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,764
Well… I mean… After what I did…

61
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,933
Wasn't that…

62
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,568
I mean…

63
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,236
You were

64
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,573
just trying to cheer me up, right?

65
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,346
Right. Then… Well… Thank you.

66
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,051
That's the end of that, okay?

67
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,288
Aren't you angry?

68
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,890
Why would I be?

69
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,560
Well… I mean… What I did

70
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,396
was so thoughtless.

71
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,167
No, not at all. I'm to blame as well.

72
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,670
To be honest, I didn't know how to react.

73
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,874
In fact, you know,

74
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:07,380
I'm not a person
who gets cheered up so much.

75
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,450
What about Mariko?

76
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,724
Do you think anyone
was there to cheer her up that day?

77
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,598
Nobody likes to be alone, do they?

78
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,201
I guess you're right.

79
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,274
You know better than anyone
what it's like to be alone.

80
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:41,180
If possible, I want
every single person to find happiness.

81
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,885
Well… I don't think that's possible.

82
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,263
<i>The three of us</i>

83
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,699
<i>started getting together again.</i>

84
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,237
Okay, let's celebrate
the restart of our group of three.

85
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,041
Wait. Don't tell me you made that.

86
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,043
-Yes.
-Wow!

87
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,245
Okay, the three of us
will pull it together.

88
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
Ready. Nobuta!

89
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,817
Sorry.

90
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,385
Ready. Go!

91
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,830
<i>When I look back on it,</i>

92
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,468
<i>the party ball was just like my future.</i>

93
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:41,774
<i>Nobody could stop me from falling.</i>

94
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,446
NOBUTA PRODUCTION RESTART

95
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,885
-Oh, dear.
-That doesn't bode well.

96
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,853
Hey.

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,456
-Make another one.
-Yes.

98
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,124
Make one.

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,193
-You make it.
-You make it.

100
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,594
Let's Rochambeau for it.

101
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,096
Ready, set, good!

102
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,332
<i>There was nothing I could do…</i>

103
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,700
Me?

104
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,768
<i>and I just fell.</i>

105
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,903
Ready, set, good!

106
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,631
-Let go of me!
-Come on, talk with me for a while.

107
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,300
Let go! I told you to cut it out!

108
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,104
-What the hell did you do that for?
-Don't get violent!

109
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,708
-Fuck off, prick!
-Why don't you fuck off?

110
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,777
Now, now! Don't get violent!

111
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,345
Get the fuck out of my way!

112
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,347
You fucking prick!

113
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,017
-I told you, don't get violent!
-You fucking prick! Fuck off!

114
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,385
Hey, you there!

115
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,221
-What the hell are you doing?
-That man and a woman were fighting!

116
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,056
-What woman?
-Some office worker.

117
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,159
-What office worker?
-I'm not involved!

118
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,027
-Come with me.
-But I'm not involved!

119
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,062
-Tell your story later.
-I'm not involved!

120
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,831
I didn't hit anyone.

121
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,400
-Please, believe me.
-Everyone says that.

122
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,036
-"Please, believe me."
-But I didn't…

123
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,906
-I was just passing by.
-I told you.

124
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,240
That's what they all say.

125
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,509
-Kon-chan.
-Yes? Oh, hi there.

126
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,011
Hold on a second.

127
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,113
-Wait.
-You sit tight for a minute.

128
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,214
Coming.

129
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,851
Oh, well, well! What's this?

130
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,225
It's over.

131
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,695
My life is totally over.

132
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,900
Hey, son.

133
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,039
I'm the chairman of
the neighborhood council.

134
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,910
In this world, the truth doesn't matter.

135
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:03,282
What matters is if you're a man
who can be believed or not.

136
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,218
What's more, son,

137
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,721
even if you're devastated,
it doesn't mean life is over!

138
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,591
Life continues after a disaster!

139
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,393
Life doesn't end that easily!

140
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,095
All right?

141
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,235
DELIVERY SEASON

142
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,136
Oh, my brother!

143
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,973
It's great to see you again!
It's me, Hiroshi!

144
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,541
I haven't seen you in so long!

145
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,010
-I brought this for you.
-Thank you very much!

146
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:47,193
<i>It's really frightening
when nobody believes you.</i>

147
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,430
<i>Thankfully, there was a witness.</i>

148
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,566
<i>But if there hadn't been one,</i>

149
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,070
<i>I would still be there.</i>

150
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,042
As long as you have life,
there will be miserable days.

151
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,745
However,

152
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,148
there will also be awesome days.

153
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,889
That's life!

154
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,327
IDEAS WANTED FOR LUNCHTIME BROADCAST

155
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,497
What's that? Did you get into a fight?

156
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,432
-Can I rip it off?
-Leave me be!

157
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,967
-Rip!
-Cut it out!

158
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,037
-Why rip it off?
-Rip!

159
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,908
Oh, your idea is for a live broadcast.

160
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,645
If this is selected,
you'll be the reporter, Nobuta?

161
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,580
Wow!

162
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,481
-Yes.
-Seriously?

163
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,150
-Wow!
-This is a great chance!

164
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,385
Hey, you! Help us think of something.

165
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,221
I'm not a member of
the broadcast club anymore.

166
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,222
So? You can think.

167
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,024
Quit laughing.

168
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,461
There must be something.
Come here, Nobuta.

169
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,197
If this idea is accepted,

170
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,133
Nobuta will become
the noontime face of Sumidagawa High.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,502
Whoa! The Mr. Mino of Sumidagawa High!

172
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,571
-Her?
-I think you mean Mr. Tamori.

173
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,440
-Careless mistake.
-"Careless mistake"?

174
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,341
Hold this.

175
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,110
Not like Mr. Mino.
How about this? Yonesuke!

176
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,011
Nice!

177
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,713
Hello.

178
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,349
It's time for
"Attack! Kotani's Surprise Lunch Check."

179
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:20,753
For the first episode, I'll be
surprise checking Mr. Yokoyama's lunch.

180
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,195
Well…

181
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,365
Not today! Today's is really bad!
Don't do this today!

182
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,366
Excuse me.

183
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,600
I LOVE YOU

184
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,335
Who made this?

185
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,170
<i>I made this myself.</i>

186
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,978
It's good, isn't it?

187
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,881
Yuck.

188
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,416
<i>How dare you say "yuck"?</i>

189
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,090
-You're back!
-Hello.

190
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,193
<i>-May I have some?
-Sure. Go right ahead.</i>

191
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,530
<i>Yuck.</i>

192
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,165
There it is! Kotani's "yuck!"

193
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,402
-You can tell by her face how awful it is!
-Yes!

194
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,071
THIS IS SOYMILK

195
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:15,708
Yuck.

196
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,609
Hey!

197
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,045
-Your "yuck" is really funny.
-No, it's not.

198
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,747
Why don't you make another
kind of catchphrase?

199
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,317
When the show's over,
I don't know how to end it.

200
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,753
A closing phrase?

201
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,256
What would be good? Something like…

202
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,658
"Watch again tomorrow!"

203
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,694
At the end.

204
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,963
"Won't you watch again tomorrow? Yip!"

205
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,168
If Nobuta's going to say it,
it should be cruder.

206
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,739
"Won't you watch again tomorrow, morons?"

207
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,542
"You idiot! It's supposed to be 'Yip!'"

208
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,576
Okay, try that.

209
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,911
That could be funny.

210
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,812
It is funny.

211
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,413
Put your hands like this.

212
00:11:55,347 --> 00:12:00,686
"Won't you watch again tomorrow, morons?"

213
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,855
"You idiot! It's supposed to be 'Yip!'"

214
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,156
"You idiot."

215
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,726
-Do it harder.
-Hey! Don't touch her!

216
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,827
Okay. How about this?

217
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,361
"Morons! You idiot!"

218
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,130
-Chomp.
-Chomp.

219
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,231
It's not an alligator!

220
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,076
You want to fight, prick?

221
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,612
I'll bust your head, prick!

222
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,547
You want to fight?

223
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,216
Who do you think you are?

224
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,052
Take that!

225
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,522
You fucking prick! Fuck off!

226
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,358
Hey, you there!
What the hell are you doing?

227
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,494
-Tell your story later.
-I'm not involved!

228
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,265
If I get involved,

229
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,901
nothing good will come of it.

230
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,307
Who said you could get up?

231
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,514
Shuji…

232
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,587
Wow! The IT revolution of pasta!

233
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,656
That's amazing!

234
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,191
-Shuji!
-Yes?

235
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,026
-Lunch with Mariko?
-Yes.

236
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,694
She's not coming for you today?

237
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,364
I thought I'd go to her first today.

238
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,800
-What a nice guy!
-Whoa!

239
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:21,700
See you.

240
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,274
Hey, isn't Tani here today?

241
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,510
Yes. Tani is almost never absent.

242
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,996
Yip yip.

243
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:51,964
Where's Shuji?

244
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,402
Ouch, that hurts!

245
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:57,937
Shuji?

246
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,505
I know.

247
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,241
Shuji?

248
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,844
Of course, he isn't there, dummy!

249
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,713
So where's Shuji?

250
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,589
What's this?

251
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,690
A bento lunch.

252
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,191
Have it.

253
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,396
Really? I can have it?

254
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,931
Yes. Go ahead.

255
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,135
Open! Whoa!

256
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,304
Hey!

257
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,876
There's even a spoon and stuff!

258
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,745
Mariko!

259
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,882
Thank you for this food!

260
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,816
Go ahead.

261
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,857
It's great!

262
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,559
This is like a dream.

263
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,394
Where's Shuji?

264
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,001
They're here! Attack time!

265
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,270
Go in! Hurry!

266
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,407
Go ahead, Kotani!

267
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,742
Hurry up and attack!

268
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,214
Shuji isn't having lunch with Mariko.

269
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:19,151
<i>Today, I'm doing a surprise check
on Mariko Uehara's lunch.</i>

270
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,986
Who's eating with Mariko?

271
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,121
<i>Yip!</i>

272
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,155
<i>Kusano?</i>

273
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,791
Astonishing! It's Kusano!

274
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,626
-What?
-<i>Liver is really good.</i>

275
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,194
Are you serious?

276
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,863
This is totally serious.

277
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,499
That was quite a lunch. I'm so full.

278
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,804
What's wrong?

279
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,140
Was Mariko's bento lunch good?

280
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,209
The shrimp balls were great!
Nice and thick!

281
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,745
<i>The fried chicken took the longest time.</i>

282
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,847
<i>The fried chicken took the longest.</i>

283
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,083
<i>-I've heard that…
-Ouch!</i>

284
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,619
Shrimp balls?

285
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,021
You're such a big fat liar, Kiritani.

286
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,600
You all right?

287
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,501
Yes.

288
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,004
Let me know if you need anything.

289
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,707
Excuse me!

290
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,444
-What is it?
-Tani!

291
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,714
He got in a fight with guys
from another school yesterday!

292
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,916
-For real?
-For real! He's all beat up!

293
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,817
Seriously?

294
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,554
Tani!

295
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,089
Tani!

296
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,326
We just heard! Are you okay?

297
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,728
-Yes.
-That looks bad!

298
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,697
-You poor thing!
-It's not as bad as it looks.

299
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,199
Who did it?

300
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,100
I don't know them.

301
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,601
You're kidding!

302
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,570
You okay?

303
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,112
You okay?

304
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,656
Looks like you can't use your arm.

305
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,594
If there's anything you need,

306
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,629
let me know.

307
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,732
You knew it was me, right?

308
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,733
What?

309
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,004
You saw me
when I was getting beat up, didn't you?

310
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,040
What? What are you talking about?

311
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,482
You want to fight, prick?

312
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,418
I'll bust your head, prick!

313
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,119
Take that!

314
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,054
You mean,

315
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,456
that was you in that fight?

316
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,591
You're a jerk.

317
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,461
You ignored me,
your own friend, getting beat up.

318
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,830
No, you're wrong. I really didn't notice.

319
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,232
Unbelievable. You looked at me.

320
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,269
I mean it.
I totally couldn't see anyone's face.

321
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,304
You're such a smooth talker,

322
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,175
you're probably hoping you can
convince me that I'm wrong.

323
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,144
Now I know
what kind of guy you really are.

324
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,615
Wait! Hold on!

325
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,219
Did you hear that?

326
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,588
I'm telling the truth!

327
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:11,824
Believe me!

328
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,659
Everyone says that.

329
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,627
"Please, believe me."

330
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,180
-You mean Shuji saw but didn't help?
-Yes.

331
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,082
That's what it sounds like.

332
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,985
-I won't stand for that.
-Yes.

333
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,956
Wouldn't you call the police?

334
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,359
That's for sure.
I'd call them or a passerby.

335
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,398
Shuji!

336
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,033
Hey!

337
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,036
Did you really ignore Tani?

338
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,741
Say something!

339
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,756
Let's go home together.

340
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,024
Wiggle wiggle!

341
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,205
Shuji!

342
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,794
I really can't believe
Shuji would do that.

343
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,137
Morning.

344
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,686
Kiritani is actually
way different than he always seemed.

345
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,594
From now on,

346
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,300
don't you guys ever
come up and talk to me.

347
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,570
Okay?

348
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,575
Bye.

349
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,848
Why?

350
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,620
I don't want people
to think you guys are like me,

351
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,459
especially Nobuta.
You've gained popularity recently.

352
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,899
Don't you dare talk to me.

353
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,377
Isn't it true that you couldn't tell that
it was Tani getting beat up?

354
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,750
Then don't you think
you should tell everyone that?

355
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,189
There's no point in telling them.

356
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,063
Right now,
it will just sound like an excuse.

357
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,964
But if you don't do anything…

358
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,870
You see,

359
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,207
my words don't carry any weight now.

360
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,978
Nobody believes…

361
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,716
anything I say now.

362
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,589
This is what it means…

363
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,227
when nobody believes you.

364
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,223
Aoi…

365
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,430
Why were you photographing me?

366
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,934
I was photographing Shuji Kiritani
taking out his anger on pigeons.

367
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,671
You shouldn't harm animals.

368
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,840
What?

369
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,942
Why were you photographing that?

370
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,880
I'm making a record of your growth.

371
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,550
A record?

372
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,288
You mean you've photographed other things?

373
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,456
Of course.

374
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:23,195
Ever since the time you proclaimed
you would be a producer for Nobuta.

375
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,564
I've got lots of photos.

376
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,066
I'll show you sometime.

377
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,603
How did you know that?

378
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,507
Who are you?

379
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,312
Kotani's friend?

380
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,881
Kotani…

381
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:52,991
DIE

382
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,235
You mean…

383
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,471
all that harassment…

384
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,340
Yes. That's right.

385
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,942
I did all that.

386
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,780
This is what I was thinking of doing next.

387
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,930
Poor Kusano will be shocked.

388
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,835
Are you surprised?

389
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,741
Why?

390
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,742
"Why?"

391
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,679
Are you asking why I'm doing this?

392
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:56,221
I think it's probably for the same reason
you're producing for Kotani.

393
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,793
You can hide in the shadows
and act like you're not involved at all.

394
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:06,398
Being able to change someone
through your own actions

395
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,700
sure is fun, isn't it?

396
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,270
Right?

397
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:14,873
Bye.

398
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,907
See you tomorrow.

399
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,826
These little pigs bring good luck.

400
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,529
-They're talismans.
-Talismans?

401
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,264
Talismans?

402
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,265
I'm home.

403
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,034
-Welcome home.
-These are yours, Shuji.

404
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,637
What are these?

405
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,905
Mom sent them.

406
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,408
They're souvenirs from Chile.
Three-legged pig talismans.

407
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,944
Remember how she asked you
on the phone the other day

408
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,846
how many friends you have?

409
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,216
-Oh, yeah.
-You've got two friends, right?

410
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,352
So including you, that's three.

411
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,723
How do you use these?

412
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,591
It looks like they're for friendship.

413
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,595
You probably give them to friends
as a symbol of your friendship.

414
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,264
A symbol of friendship…

415
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,033
If you both have one,

416
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,136
then they probably bring lifelong,
unflagging friendship.

417
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,172
How long do they work?

418
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,574
Forever, of course.

419
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,775
-Forever?
-Yes.

420
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,111
Then maybe I won't give them out.

421
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,946
-You don't want it to be forever?
-Yes.

422
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,178
Who's the next "Attack" victim?

423
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,285
Good morning.

424
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,960
Let's go.

425
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,897
Morning. Good morning, everyone.

426
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,231
-Good morning.
-Morning.

427
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,533
Morning.

428
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,967
Morning.

429
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,811
You want to get <i>monjayaki</i> again?

430
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,847
-Yes.
-Do you know about strawberry milk?

431
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,517
-No.
-It's like a dessert. It's sweet and good.

432
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,721
And let's go to a place
only for girls again.

433
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,430
What is it? Why do you want to talk to me?

434
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:58,803
How can I

435
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:00,972
get you to stop?

436
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,874
Stop what?

437
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,177
This.

438
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,418
You just want me to stop?

439
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,295
I want you to stop seeing Kotani
and never talk to her again.

440
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,564
I knew it.

441
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,967
That's what it is.

442
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:34,072
Your weakness is Kotani
and Kusano, isn't it?

443
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,810
For Kotani,

444
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,880
you're her first friend.

445
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:47,552
So if she found out the truth…

446
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,221
I see why you're worried.

447
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,861
She's been hurt badly
ever since she was a kid.

448
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,100
So why do you have to hurt her
more than she already is?

449
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,505
Don't tell her.

450
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,140
Maybe I will.

451
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,678
I'm begging you. Please don't tell her.

452
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,680
Don't worry. I won't tell her yet.

453
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,517
I'm waiting until we're closer friends.

454
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,586
I plan on

455
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,857
plunging Kotani into such deep despair
that she would want to kill herself.

456
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,395
What?

457
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,901
What's your damn problem?

458
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,308
No! Stop! Let go of me!

459
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,777
No! Stop! Let go!

460
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,680
Don't you do that, Shuji!

461
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,015
Bad hand! Bad! Bad!

462
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,587
Kiritani tried to…

463
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,542
Kiritani said…

464
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,914
that I was the one
who wrecked the haunted house.

465
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,650
But I didn't do anything!

466
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,726
It's wrong to raise your fist
against a woman, you know. Pow!

467
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:39,831
But knowing you,
I'm sure you had a good reason.

468
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,036
Do you…

469
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,507
believe me?

470
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,411
You bet! I believe you.

471
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,381
No matter what?

472
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,116
No matter what.

473
00:31:58,783 --> 00:31:59,984
I promise.

474
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,187
No.

475
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,691
Don't promise.

476
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,660
How come?

477
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,331
Well…

478
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,237
If you believe me…

479
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,740
If you still believe

480
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,576
what I say…

481
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,549
Then I've got something to tell you.

482
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,055
Tell me now.

483
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,125
Well, you see…

484
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,028
My head's so mixed up right now.

485
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,733
Can you wait until
I've figured things out?

486
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,038
I don't really get it.

487
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:55,907
But all right.

488
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,946
We're always best friends!

489
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,614
Shuji!

490
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,935
Is it true
that Aoi wrecked the haunted house?

491
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,638
Who said that?

492
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,243
Aoi said you said that to her.

493
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,247
I said that?

494
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,520
I didn't say that.

495
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,759
There's no way Aoi would do that.

496
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,828
I mean, she's your friend.

497
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,864
Right?

498
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,943
Kotani.

499
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,698
Yes! Akira is happy!

500
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,638
What?

501
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,344
Akira is shocked!

502
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,141
Isn't there any other outfit?

503
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,678
What's wrong with being vampires?

504
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,114
Wait!

505
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,183
Who's there?

506
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,191
You saw us, didn't you?

507
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,262
So could you tell how I did it?

508
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:33,898
No, it's all right.

509
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,236
We can change now, right?

510
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,738
Let's practice a little more.

511
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,773
Can't I do it in my regular clothes?

512
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,380
Well…

513
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,449
What is this?

514
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,152
Entertainment for the end-of-year party.

515
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,355
You know, I wonder if

516
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,957
vampires really do exist.

517
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,095
I don't think they do.

518
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,864
I guess they don't.

519
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,503
But, you know,

520
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,308
if even one person on Earth
believes in them,

521
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,511
I get the feeling they exist.

522
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,116
We don't believe things
because they're true.

523
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,786
Things are true because we believe them.

524
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,321
Understand?

525
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,594
The day everyone stops believing,

526
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,463
that's probably the day

527
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,267
that vampires disappear from existence.

528
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,075
Which hand?

529
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,577
What?

530
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,679
Which hand?

531
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,682
It looks like it is in your right hand.

532
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,116
Then which one is it in?

533
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,987
Choose the one you believe it is.

534
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,890
Nobody knows what the real truth is.

535
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,163
Then your only choice is
the one you want to believe in, right?

536
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,133
The one I want to believe…

537
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,399
You're right!

538
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,434
Yip yip!

539
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,188
What's wrong?

540
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,459
What is it?

541
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,530
I saw something that

542
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,699
I didn't want to see.

543
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,468
And?

544
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,175
I want to act like I never saw it.

545
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,911
I see.

546
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,548
But that's not possible,

547
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,484
is it?

548
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,588
Yes, it is.

549
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,525
No way! Ouch!

550
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,196
So this makes me unsee it?

551
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,264
Yes.

552
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,233
Our family has always put things

553
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,236
we didn't want to see in here
and sealed them away.

554
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,073
That's how we act like it didn't happen.

555
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,876
I'll give you some
of this fermenting miso.

556
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,447
So put whatever you like in here.

557
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,285
When you pull it out in a few decades,

558
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,154
I'm sure you'll laugh about it.

559
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,663
There!

560
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,202
Will I really laugh?

561
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,404
You bet you'll laugh.

562
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,941
That stinks.

563
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,418
<i>"Even if you're devastated,</i>

564

any problem can be solved.

Believe with me.

Charge!

581
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,342
Shuji.

Let's go home together.

583
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:33,717
Okay.

584
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,085
Let's go home.

585
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:59,810
Ready, go!
