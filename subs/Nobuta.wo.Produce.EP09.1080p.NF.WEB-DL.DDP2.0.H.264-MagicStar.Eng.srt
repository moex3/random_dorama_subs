1
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:06,706
What is it?

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,343
A pig.

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,811
A pig!

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,147
It's a souvenir from Chile.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,616
It's only got three legs.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,219
It's a talisman from that region.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,621
I see. A talisman.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,056
What kind of talisman?

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:27,660
I want you guys to know
that I didn't buy them.

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,763
My mom sent them to me.

11
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,766
So what kind of talisman is it?

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,502
For family safety?

13
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,936
No, not that.

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,204
Safe birth!

15
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,473
Why "safe birth"? That's ridiculous.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,641
Then what's it for?

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,881
Friendship…

18
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,315
Friendship?

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,383
Friendship…

20
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,421
Yes, it's something like that, I think.

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,290
Thank you. I'll treasure it.

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,692
Friendship?

23
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,129
I guess this means
that we're friends forever.

24
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,297
I'm overjoyed!

25
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,901
I'm not sure it means "forever."

26
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,437
It means we'll never be able to separate.

27
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,338
-No.
-Pervert!

28
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,706
I didn't buy them!

29
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,809
My mom sent them to me.

30
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,709
I'm stuck to you!

31
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,214
Good morning!

32
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,083
Ready, set, good!

33
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,118
Nice to be here!

34
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,390
Morning!

35
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,395
<i>As usual,</i>

36
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,498
<i>everyone else in class
continued to ignore me.</i>

37
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,003
<i>But that didn't matter much to me.</i>

38
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,345
What's that?

39
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,980
Did you buy that?

40
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,549
It was a gift?

41
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,985
Is that right? How cute.

42
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,522
<i>But as for Aoi…</i>

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,360
I plan on plunging Kotani
into such deep despair

44
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,262
that she wants to kill herself.

45
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:15,268
<i>When I see her, I'm overcome with
such a feeling of horror,</i>

46
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>I can hardly breathe.</i>

47
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,541
Shuji!

48
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,843
Your friend is here.

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,512
My friend?

50
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,249
Hey!

51
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,085
Welcome home.

52
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,155
-Thank you so much for doing this.
-No problem.

53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,226
What are you doing?

54
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,829
My hamburger steak is really delicious.

55
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,497
What the heck are you doing here?

56
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,733
I promised
that I'd show you the photos, right?

57
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,136
Oh, what's that? It's so cute!

58
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,572
We've got an extra one. Have it.

59
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,973
-Really?
-What are you doing?

60
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,308
-Thank you!
-She can have it.

61
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,743
This looks delicious!

62
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,011
Don't touch it!

63
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,114
We haven't said our thanks yet.

64
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,849
Oops. My bad habit.

65
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,684
Actually, I'll be going.

66
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,553
-Really?
-I've got cram school.

67
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,022
-You should stay and eat with us.
-Yes.

68
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,558
Kiritani, here are the photos I promised.

69
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,662
See you tomorrow at school.

70
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,497
Good night.

71
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,998
Thank you so much.

72
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,233
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,768
-Bye-bye.
-Take care.

74
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,273
-What?
-What are you doing?

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,441
Why are you doing that?

76
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,610
What's the matter? What?

77
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,811
What are you doing?

78
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,845
You're kidding!

79
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,148
Why did you do that?

80
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,984
After she went to the trouble
of making it, why would you do that?

81
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,220
What'll we do for dinner now?

82
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,155
I'll buy us something.

83
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,369
<i>This wasn't simply hatred.</i>

84
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,473
<i>This was more like…</i>

85
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,042
Hey!

86
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,817
What the heck are you doing?

87
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,520
I want to be one of you guys.

88
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,190
One of us?

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,292
It doesn't have to be forever.

90
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,562
Just let me be one of
the people producing Nobuta.

91
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,366
Then just like you asked,

92
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,770
I'll disappear from Kotani's life
without a word.

93
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,243
<i>Since I had no idea what she was thinking,</i>

94
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,312
<i>I was afraid.</i>

95
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,016
Good morning!

96
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,518
Kotani!

97
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,520
Good morning.

98
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,722
-Good morning.
-Look at this.

99
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,091
Voilà!

100
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,061
Kiritani and I made up.

101
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:01,434
Also, he asked me
if I would help be a producer for you.

102
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,705
Is that all right if I join you guys?

103
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,579
You mean, everything that happened
until now was done by Aoi?

104
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,114
That's right.

105
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,482
What did she do it for?

106
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,321
I have no idea.

107
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,624
I see.

108
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,828
Aoi?

109
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,731
That hurts!

110
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,766
Anyway, sit down.

111
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,003
I see…

112
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,106
-I'll kick her ass!
-What?

113
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,241
Hey! Wait!

114
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,309
-Wait!
-Let go of me!

115
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,278
You can't hit a woman!

116
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,047
Oh, yeah! That's right! I forgot that!

117
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,015
Okay?

118
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,558
But isn't Aoi, Nobuta's friend?

119
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,559
That's right.

120
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,095
Also…

121
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,666
She wants to join our group.

122
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,169
Join our group?
You mean me, you, and Nobuta?

123
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,771
-Yes.
-What?

124
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,706
Absolutely not!

125
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,241
I don't want her to either…

126
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,777
I really don't want that either,

127
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:23,516
but if we don't let her join us,
she's going to tell the truth to Nobuta.

128
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,817
What?

129
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,353
Could you tell Nobuta

130
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:34,327
that her first friend ever
was the one who'd been harassing her?

131
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:40,266
Nobuta could end up
not believing in anything again.

132
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,635
I don't believe that things will change.

133
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,904
When I believe and open up my heart,

134
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,507
I only get hurt.

135
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,310
If she crawls into her shell again,

136
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,281
I get the feeling
she may never come out again.

137
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,936
It's nice to be here.

138
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,707
Arf!

139
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,913
<i>I was so incredibly afraid,
I couldn't stand it.</i>

140
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,517
<i>Probably,
the reason I made the wrong choice</i>

141
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,821
<i>was because of that.</i>

142
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,380
<i>-Yuck.
-What? Why?</i>

143
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,051
You know, I still think

144
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,422
we should make up
another catchphrase or line for you.

145
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,359
Like, "The IT revolution in food!"

146
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,527
Yes. When you eat it…

147
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,897
"Inside my mouth, it's like a hotdog bun!"

148
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,899
"Hotdog bun!" I like that!

149
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,000
I know.

150
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,903
"Inside my mouth,
it's like the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance!"

151
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,538
"Satsuma-Choshu Alliance!" Yes!

152
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,140
-Clink clink!
-Try Satsuma-Choshu Alliance.

153
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,877
Inside my mouth,
it's like the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance.

154
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,879
Then do "Clink clink!"

155
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,647
-Hey. Excuse me.
-Clink clink!

156
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,016
Let's try to be more serious.

157
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,185
We are being serious.

158
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,219
Seriously serious.

159
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,156
The way you do things is
really pretty weak.

160
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,091
That hurts!

161
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,392
What do you mean by weak?

162
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,730
I think this is why
Kotani is still so dull.

163
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,567
If we want her to be popular,
we need to be more thorough.

164
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,505
I think there are still lots of things
that need to be improved, like education

165
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,142
and improving her sense of style
and how she talks.

166
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,710
But, you know,

167
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,214
if Nobuta could do everything,
would that be interesting?

168
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,384
I think what's interesting is

169
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,587
seeing awkward Nobuta
trying her best to improve.

170
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,357
But I think if that makes her popular,
it's not real popularity.

171
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:25,197
I want Kotani to become someone
that everyone would approve of.

172
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,200
You say you're producing for her,

173
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,003
but you're hardly trying at all.

174
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,339
Oh, that ticks me off!

175
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,676
Whack! We were here first!
What gives you the right to say that?

176
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,511
Now, now. It's all right. Leave it be.

177
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,046
I'm angry.

178
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,448
I will do my best.

179
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,453
I just need to try harder.

180
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,795
I'm sorry about that.

181
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,898
I spoke out of place.

182
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,233
It's okay.

183
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,373
First, why not try shortening your skirt?

184
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,876
Don't you think it's a little long?

185
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,679
You think so?

186
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,381
Yes.

187
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,086
And I think your hair would be cuter
if you had it in pigtails.

188
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,188
Want to try?

189
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,458
-Okay.
-Good.

190
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,895
CLOSED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS

191
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,098
Hot springs sure sound nice.

192
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,733
I'd like to go.

193
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,770
Hey! You're bringing a rice cooker?

194
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,975
You know what? Actually, I might…

195
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,443
Yes?

196
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,212
I might not ever return.

197
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,680
What? That hurts!

198
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,749
How come?

199
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,519
The proprietress of
the hot spring inn I'm going to,

200
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,488
she's an old classmate,

201
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,124
but her husband died young.

202
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,226
Oh, and?

203
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,328
You see,

204
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,400
she said there's something
she wants to ask me to do!

205
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,136
I see. And what is it?

206
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,071
That's the question.

207
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,172
What I think is

208
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,007
it's become too difficult

209
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:19,211
for a fragile woman like her
to run the inn all by herself.

210
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,314
Mr. Hirayama, are you going to

211
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,251
marry that woman?

212
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,260
Well, there is that possibility.

213
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,731
I guess you could say
that it just might happen.

214
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,002
If I don't come back,

215
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,005
then assume that's what happened.

216
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,707
Seriously?

217
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:03,589
The way you talk, Kotani,
you're way too timid.

218
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,191
Yes.

219
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,529
I think that's one reason
why you get bullied and stuff.

220
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,968
Sit up straight.

221
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,336
Lift your chin up.

222
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,240
That's right. And talk more femininely.

223
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,511
I'm not sure I can.

224
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,981
Don't worry. You can do it.

225
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,686
<i>What do you recommend?</i>

226
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,387
<i>The sweet and sour pork.</i>

227
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,490
<i>May I have one?</i>

228
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,557
<i>Sure.</i>

229
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,627
<i>It's delicious.</i>

230
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,696
-Today, Kotani's so ordinary!
-<i>Thank you.</i>

231
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,265
Maybe it's the way she talks.

232
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,033
-Maybe so.
-It's her voice.

233
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,436
-She acts differently, doesn't she?
-Yes.

234
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,538
And her skirt is shorter too.

235
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,839
Seriously?

236
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,509
Cut that out! That's so perverted!

237
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,512
-You're perverted too!
-<i>I'll surprise check again tomorrow.</i>

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,215
I want to go back.

239
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,252
What do you mean?

240
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,289
This doesn't feel like the real me.

241
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,526
But isn't this what producing is?

242
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,329
I mean, you're playing someone
that isn't yourself.

243
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,999
But…

244
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,743
If she doesn't like it,
then maybe we should stop.

245
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,180
Why do you spoil her like that?

246
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,317
What? What's wrong with spoiling her?

247
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,619
It doesn't do Kotani any good.

248
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:46,659
Are you saying it's better for her
to just deal with it and endure it?

249
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,096
You see,
humans can't improve unless they do that.

250
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,799
Actually, I don't think that's true.

251
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,470
I think people end up being mean
and cruel when they're

252
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,340
forced to put up with things
they don't want to.

253
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,111
I'd rather be treated kindly by others.

254
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,649
That's why I want to be
as kind as I can to people from now on.

255
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,218
You want to be treated kindly?

256
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,122
The way you talk, you sound like a child.

257
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,858
So what if I do?

258
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,996
I'm just a brat anyway.

259
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,655
The next photo could be of them kissing.

260
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,092
Maybe.

261
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,700
You did see the photo of
Kotani hugging Kiritani, didn't you?

262
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,206
Then why are you still
hanging around them?

263
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,944
Isn't it painful?

264
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,753
To me, Shuji and Nobuta are
the most important.

265
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,188
I'm number two.

266
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,556
You're such a liar.

267
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,593
Everyone believes
they're the most important.

268
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,661
I'm not lying.

269
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,065
It's more important to have fun every day.

270
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,735
So I put my priority on that.

271
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,874
You know, don't you think
your way of doing things is wrong?

272
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,211
People shouldn't be tested.

273
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,149
If you don't test them,
then what do you do with them?

274
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,951
You cultivate them.

275
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,586
With love!

276
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,221
Bye.

277
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,248
UGLY PIG

278
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,625
Kotani…

279
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:45,070
This was left on my desk.

280
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
Thank you.

281
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,914
Can I see your grandpa?

282
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,286
The old man at the aquarium that I helped…

283
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,456
Your grandfather…

284
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,494
I want to ask him something.

285
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,766
Can I see him?

286
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,236
No.

287
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:18,937
You can't.

288
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,210
Because that's a lie that I made up.

289
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,719
Did you

290
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,388
do those things?

291
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,258
Did you wreck

292
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,960
the haunted house?

293
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,363
Did you wreck the tape?

294
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,066
Did you do all of it?

295
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,966
Yes.

296
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,435
That's right.

297
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,372
Why?

298
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,574
Because I hate you.

299
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,211
You're irritating.

300
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,648
"The three of us are all friends."

301
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,417
That stuff is such bullshit.

302
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,022
Your kindness to me

303
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,292
and when you said

304
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,661
we were friends.

305
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,797
Those were all lies?

306
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,999
Yes. They're lies.

307
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,735
I was going to be even kinder

308
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,240
and then push you into despair
when it would be most effective.

309
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,176
Too bad, right?

310
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,218
Hey, that's enough of that.

311
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,419
She's crying.

312
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,655
Aren't you the girl Kiritani dumped?

313
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,559
I've got some news for you.

314
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:53,132
Actually,
Kiritani and this girl are dating.

315
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,800
What? No, we're not.

316
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,135
So?

317
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,238
What about it?

318
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,940
Don't act so tough.

319
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,096
Was that girl your friend?

320
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,177
Roast chestnuts.

321
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,314
Nice and warm, right?

322
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,758
Would you rather you were still friends
even if she kept lying to you?

323
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,867
I'm also glad I learned the truth.

324
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,405
It feels lonely being lied to.

325
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,078
But

326
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,082
it's also probably lonely
if you're always lying.

327
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,887
I wanted everyone

328
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,656
to think that I had a girlfriend.

329
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,925
Sorry.

330
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,895
You may be right.

331
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,937
You like it?

332
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,256
-Mr. Yokoyama!
-Yes?

333
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,392
The end-of-year party last night
sure was rough, wasn't it?

334
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,528
The end-of-year party?
What happened back then?

335
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,730
What?

336
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,366
After all you did, you don't remember it?

337
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,534
What? Did I do something?

338
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,970
-If you don't remember, forget it!
-What? Wait!

339
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,039
Tell me what happened!

340
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,175
-Mr. Yokoyama, you sure are young!
-What the heck happened?

341
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,846
-You got drunk and dissed the principal.
-No way!

342
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,049
What's more,
you slapped your resignation in his face.

343
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,017
Resignation?

344
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,552
You smacked it right on his forehead.

345
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,122
I don't remember that.

346
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,596
"Resignation!
I quit being a damn teacher!"

347
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,502
I have officially accepted
this resignation.

348
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,070
You're kidding!

349
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,371
No, I'm not.

350
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,626
<i>Today, we're surprise checking
first year, class B.</i>

351
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,561
<i>Hello.</i>

352
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,964
You know,
Kotani is the best to do this show.

353
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,499
Yes. This isn't funny.

354
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,234
Yes, not at all. It's dull.

355
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,202
Not at all.

356
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,238
Kusano.

357
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,473
That hurts!

358
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,175
Where's Kotani?

359
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,445
She's absent.

360
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,114
That figures.

361
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,750
Her friend
said awful things to her yesterday.

362
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,320
<i>They're both good? Today…</i>

363
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,322
Friend? You mean her?

364
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,393
Yes. That girl.

365
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,400
Aoi told Nobuta the truth?

366
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,037
That girl… Darn her.

367
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,476
The stuff she said was pretty harsh.

368
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,146
I just wanted to tell you that.

369
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,516
Yip yip.

370
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:07,819
Mariko!

371
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,602
Thank you.

372
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,308
Kotani will be all right.

373
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,548
It may take time, but she'll be okay.

374
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:44,523
Accepting the truth is really painful.

375
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,392
But…

376
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,062
it's not impossible to do.

377
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,256
<i>Since we're friends,
I'll have it for free.</i>

378
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:19,925
Okay?

379
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,962
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

380
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,847
Nobuta!

381
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,482
Nobuta!

382
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,383
Kotani!

383
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,152
Kotani?

384
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,988
I know you're in there, Nobuta.

385
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,493
-Nobuta!
-Yip yip! This is when you use it! Yip!

386
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,167
I knew this would happen.

387
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,937
There are some things
you just can't ignore.

388
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,713
-Nobuta!
-Nobuta!

389
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,648
Come out!

390
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,350
-Kotani!
-Nobuta!

391
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,051
I know you're there!

392
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,022
Nobuta!

393
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,626
Nobuta!

394
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,027
Nobuta!

395
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,262
I know you're there!

396
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:46,945
<i>We are…</i>

397
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,548
<i>-Sumidagawa High Night Angels!</i>
<i>-Sumidagawa High Night Angels!</i>

398
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:53,251
Come on! Put Kotani back on, man!

399
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:58,056
-We want to see Kotani's, "Yuck!"
-That's right!

400
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,525
And when it's really bad,
her eyebrows twitch.

401
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,962
-That's right!
-I want to see that twitch again!

402
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,399
-It's a lucky day when you see that.
-Yes! That's lucky!

403
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,433
Get the camera!

404
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,802
Let's film this and give it to Nobuta.

405
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,172
Yip!

406
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,223
I have a favor to ask everyone.

407
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,862
I'm afraid Kotani

408
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,266
might not ever come back to school.

409
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,372
But if she hears what you're saying

410
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,542
I think she'll come back.

411
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,246
That's the kind of person she is.

412
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:05,890
So I want to film all of your comments
and bring them to Kotani.

413
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,627
Will you do that?

414
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:15,934
I know none of you
want to do a favor for me.

415
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,169
But just this once…

416
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,640
Just this once…

417
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,275
do me this favor.

418
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,514
Please.

419
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,425
<i>When I think about…</i>

420
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,361
how you may not even be…

421
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,431
listening to what I say right now,

422
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,534
I'm afraid.

423
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,905
I'm so afraid, I could die.

424
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,914
We're listening.

425
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,887
Don't worry. We hear you.

426
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,224
Yes.

427
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,926
I'm not sure what happened,

428
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,395
but let's help out.

429
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,064
-Yes.
-Right?

430
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,066
-It's to bring Kotani back.
-That's right!

431
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,467
Okay!

432
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,403
Get the camera ready!

433
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,905
-All right!
-All right!

434
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,774
-All right!
-All right!

435
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,342
All right!

436
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,719
It's the great first episode of
"Kotani Surprise Lunch Check"!

<i>Nobuta, come back!</i>

462
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:16,074
Yes! Reporter Kotani!
We've been waiting for you!

463
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,777
Welcome back!

464
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,117
-L-O-V-E! Lovely Kotani!
-L-O-V-E! Lovely Kotani!

465
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,464
That girl's
probably going to do something again.

466
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,269
I think she's frightened.

467
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:47,839
Why?

468
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:52,510
She's afraid
we'll tell everyone the truth.

469
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,746
I think that scares her.

470
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,614
Then we shouldn't worry.

471
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,485
But if she feels cornered,

472
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,554
I just hope she doesn't go into a frenzy.

473
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:08,459
I don't really get her,
but she's a real pain.

474
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,104
"Come to the school roof."

475
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,606
"Aoi…"

476
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,958
So you came.

477
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,162
What is it?

478
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:24,235
If I jump from here,
do you think I'll die?

479
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,141
Are you angry?

480
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,612
Of course, you are.

481
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,982
I did do some pretty cruel things to you.

482
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,423
Will you forgive me for what I did?

483
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:53,831
If you won't forgive me,
I'll jump from here.

484
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,868
How about it?

485
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,272
Will you forgive me or not?

486
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,811
I can't forgive you.

487
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,748
Okay.

488
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,052
Then I'll jump.

489
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,457
Stay back!

490
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,632
This is your final chance.

491
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,468
Will you

492
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,171
forgive me?

493
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,574
Kotani,

494
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,776
will you?

495
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,813
What are you doing?

496
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,218
Aoi wants me to forgive her.

497
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,587
If I don't, she says she'll jump.

498
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,355
What will it be?

499
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,892
Will you forgive me or not?

500
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,297
I told you to quit testing people.

501
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,301
This is the only way she knows how to act.

502
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,805
You know everything, don't you, Kiritani?

503
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,675
You're amazing.

504
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,479
Don't jump.

505
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,682
Then you forgive me?

506
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,617
No, I can't forgive you.

507
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,054
But don't jump.

508
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,355
It doesn't work that way.

509
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,091
It's one or the other.

510
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,196
Wait!

511
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,665
You…

512
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,703
You don't even
really want her to forgive you, do you?

513
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,905
That's right.

514
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,876
I don't care if she forgives me.

515
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,580
Then what is it that you want to do?

516
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,655
I want you to remember me.

517
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,294
Even if it's for awful things,

518
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,297
I want you to remember…

519
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,535
that I existed.

520
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,673
That's all.

521
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,376
Bye.

522
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,123
Aoi!

523
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,336
Aoi!

524
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,271
That hurts!

525
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,908
I just had a weird dream.

526
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,213
A dream that Aoi jumped?

527
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,516
It was the school roof!

528
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,127
That hurts!

529
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,773
Aoi.

530
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,877
Aoi?

531
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,154
Did you dream that

532
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,592
you jumped from the roof?

533
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,897
Thank goodness.

534
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,004
I'm so glad

535
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,641
you're alive.

536
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,757
DELPHINE

537
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,797
What are you doing?

538
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,301
I'm just waiting for someone.

539
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,736
At a place like this?

540
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,905
Who are you waiting for?

541
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,509
Someone called my phone
out of the blue and said,

542
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,845
"Let's be friends."

543
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:43,981
And

544
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,917
you went to wait for them?

545
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,019
Yes.

546
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,123
But they haven't shown up.

547
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,694
You must have been tricked.

548
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,530
Maybe so.

549
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,666
They sounded awfully lonely though.

550
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,101
Oh,

551
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,270
they're here!

552
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,739
Are you the one who called me?

553
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,880
Wow.

554
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,049
What a magnificent moon.

555
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,487
Yes.

556
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,596
<i>Why the four of us had the same dream,</i>

557
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,766
<i>I still don't know.</i>

558
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,602
You let me join your group,

559
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,372
but it wasn't as fun as I expected.

560
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,441
I'll release you.

561
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,954
<i>Aoi disappeared from us forever.</i>

562
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:03,761
<i>My classmates started talking to me again.</i>

563
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,762
Shuji.

564
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:09,700
Yokoyama gave his resignation
to the principal and has to quit.

565
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,136
What? Yokoyama's quitting?

566
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:18,609
<i>For Yokoyama's sake, we stayed up
all night forging petitions.</i>

567
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,211
I LOVE MR. YOKOYAMA! AKIKO KUSAKA

568
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,180
Yip!

569
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,650
Everyone, we got 100 petitions!

570
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,789
PETITION TO RESCIND
TAKESHI YOKOYAMA'S RESIGNATION

571
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,799
Out of consideration of these petitions,
I'll forget it.

572
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,635
Thank you!

573
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,708
<i>Mr. Hirayama came back too.</i>

574
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,044
So that proprietress wanted to ask you

575
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,947
to buy health products?

576
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,016
Yes. That's right.

577
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,685
Oh, I see.

578
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,633
What are you looking at?

579
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:25,075
Have you ever been in a situation
that was beyond redemption?

580
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,080
Yes.

581
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,483
I have.

582
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,721
Did you make it through alone?

583
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,461
No. With friends.

584
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,134
Is that right?

585
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,603
My friends brought me through.

586
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,008
<i>Only people</i>

587
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,178
<i>can save other people.</i>

588
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,717
I think I'm going to start over.

589
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,154
Start what over?

590
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,756
In our class,

591
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,627
I think I'll start building
Shuji Kiritani again.

592
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,063
You want to become popular again?

593
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,833
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

594
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,369
I'll be your producer. Twang!

595
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,505
No, thank you. Twang!

596
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:29,607
Twang! Why?

597
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,475
<i>As long as you have someone,</i>

598
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,811
<i>even if you're in a situation
beyond redemption,</i>

599
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,613
<i>you can make it through.</i>

600
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,916
Welcome home.

601
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,587
Yes…

602
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,222
What's your problem?

603
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,592
This is kind of sudden,
but I'm getting transferred.

604
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,061
What? We're moving?

605
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:52,963
Yes.

606
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,301
That tickles!

607
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,502
<i>As long as I'm here,</i>

608
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:04,008
<i>I doubt that I'll ever lose my way.</i>

609
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,909
Nobuta! Hold him!

610
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,209
FINAL EPISODE PREVIEW
FAREWELL AMIGO

611
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,110
Farewell,

612
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,712
Shuji Kiritani.

613
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,948
