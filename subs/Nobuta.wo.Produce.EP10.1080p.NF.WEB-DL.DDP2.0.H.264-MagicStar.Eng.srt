00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,279
HIRAYAMA TOFU SHOP

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,981
<i>GANMODOKI</i>

3
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,983
I saw Santa Claus.

4
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:18,885
Where?

5
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:19,853
Seriously?

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,288
In a dream.

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,556
Oh, a dream.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,524
And?

9
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,429
He asked me, "Is there anything you want?"

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,865
And what did you ask for?

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:33,967
Well…

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,937
<i>At the time,
I couldn't think of what I wanted, so…</i>

13
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,240
Never mind me.

14
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,308
SHUJI KIRITANI

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,911
Go and ask Shuji Kiritani.

16
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,519
I saw him in a dream too!

17
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,154
-Really?
-Yes.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,688
-You liar.
-No! I mean it!

19
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,758
Yes, I saw him and he asked me too.

20
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,728
"Is there anything you want?"

21
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,499
No. Forget about me.

22
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,536
Why don't you ask Kusano?

23
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,404
-Me?
-Yes.

24
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,206
Did you see Santa Claus?

25
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,374
You liars!

26
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,178
Both of you. There's no way that happened…

27
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,781
-Yes, it did.
-You saw him?

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,483
-Right?
-Yes.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,585
What did Santa Claus say?

30
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,687
Well…

31
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,525
Something like, "I'll give you a present!"

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,262
What do I want? Well…

33
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:38,965
Curry buns.

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,600
That's what I said.

35
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,336
Curry buns?

36
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,739
These were gifts. Help yourselves.

37
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:47,974
-Wow!
-Thank you.

38
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,642
-It's Santa!
-Whoa!

39
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,146
I was forced to wear this and work
the lottery booth in the shopping arcade.

40
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,949
Okay, be good boys and girls.
Merry Christmas!

41
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,750
Merry Christmas!

42
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,651
Santa came.

43
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,322
-Shuji.
-Yes?

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,757
Curry buns!

45
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,297
Santa Claus granted your wish.

46
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,465
He sure did.

47
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,703
Why the heck did you sever
our loop of goodwill?

48
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,072
And of all things,
you asked for curry buns?

49
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,309
He didn't tell me you referred him to me!

50
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,346
If you'd told him to go see Nobuta,

51
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,048
the loop of goodwill
would have been complete.

52
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,517
You opted for curry buns instead.

53
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,453
It was going so well,
then you asked for curry buns.

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,455
-That does suck.
-Yes, it's appalling.

55
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,556
It's appalling!

56
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,457
I'm leaving.

57
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,292
-I'm leaving too.
-How come?

58
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,261
But the chime hasn't rung.

59
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,131
Hey, come on. The chime still hasn't rung.

60
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,933
What?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,135
That was all just a dream!

62
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,336
Grow up, would you?

63
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,176
You think we were a little cruel?

64
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,845
No, he'll be fine.

65
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,414
He'll be just fine.

66
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,784
<i>I don't want to move.</i>

67
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,721
We just have to accept it.

68
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,690
It's Dad's work, after all.

69
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,526
And I loved this place too.

70
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,364
Actually…

71
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,833
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,870
I think I can smile now!

73
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,274
Oh, okay. Give it a try.

74
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,151
Well…

75
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,588
It needs a little more work.

76
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,726
Oh…

77
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,728
You're almost there.

78
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,233
Weren't you about to say something?

79
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,336
Me?

80
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,807
Oh, what was it?

81
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,777
What was it? I forgot.

82
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,679
I forgot.

83
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,384
<i>I couldn't say that I was moving away.</i>

84
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,826
<i>I'll tell them today.
I swear I'll tell them.</i>

85
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,870
-Say…
-Hey…

86
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,642
There's something I want to say.

87
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,847
How come…

88
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,784
you never call me by my name?

89
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,686
What? We don't?

90
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,623
What did we call you?

91
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,697
You say "Hey" or "You."

92
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,801
I call you guys "Shuji" and "Nobuta."

93
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,071
But you don't call me anything.

94
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,775
Don't be stupid. We do use your name.

95
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,877
We call you "Kusano."

96
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,348
-"Kusano."
-That sounds so distant.

97
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,019
Then what do you want us to call you?

98
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,461
<i>"Hey…"</i>

99
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,631
<i>"Oh, Akira!"</i>

100
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,200
<i>"Yip!"</i>

101
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,172
Call me by my first name.

102
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,042
What is your first name?

103
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,979
Akira is shocked!

104
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,848
You don't know?

105
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,749
What?

106
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,920
Akira!

107
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,756
Oh, right.

108
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,791
Akira!

109
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,794
Are you angry?

110
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,263
-Like that?
-She's not angry.

111
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,164
Say it again.

112
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,900
Akira!

113
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,103
Try saying it a little more tenderly.

114
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,773
Akira!

115
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,274
Nobuta!

116
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,612
<i>I don't want us
to become any closer than this.</i>

117
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,513
Try saying my name.

118
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,515
Shuji.

119
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,016
That's so kind.

120
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,019
Now try saying, "Shuji and Akira."

121
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,222
Shuji and Akira!

122
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,524
Who am I to you?

123
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,026
Try "Shuji and Akira…"

124
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,928
<i>We'll be splitting up soon.</i>

125
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,165
<i>So becoming closer…</i>

126
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,166
Akira!

127
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,667
<i>…would just make it sadder.</i>

128
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,328
Now for my final question.

129
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,831
Are you two in love?

130
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,900
Yes, we are.

131
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,103
How's Chie's cooking?

132
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,072
It's still yucky.

133
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,544
That's it for the
Sumidagawa High Lunchtime broadcast.

134
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,312
Cut!

135
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,080
Thank you very much, everyone.

136
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,883
Kotani!

137
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,754
Won't you please take a photo with us?

138
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,824
-That's a great idea!
-Take one with us too!

139
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,994
-Ready, go.
-Is this…

140
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,796
-Destiny?
-Destiny?

141
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,698
-How cute!
-Nice!

142
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,567
Kotani!

143
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,571
Hang in there!

144
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,308
-Kotani!
-Kotani!

145
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,643
-Kotani!
-Give me your autograph!

146
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,146
Give me your autograph!

147
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,581
They want her autograph!

148
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,716
Wow! She's famous now.

149
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,451
-Yes.
-Kotani's pretty amazing.

150
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,352
Yes.

151
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,900
AKIRA KUSANO

152
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,709
-Say…
-Say…

153
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,079
What? What is it?

154
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,951
Oh, never mind me. It's not a big deal.

155
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,989
Then you go, Nobuta.

156
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,024
I… Actually…

157
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,926
I'm not sure how to say this.

158
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:53,533
After everything you two have done for me,
I'm not sure I should say this.

159
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:02,575
It's actually really brutal
doing the "Surprise Lunch Check."

160
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,044
I see.

161
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,481
-Then quit doing it.
-But…

162
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,418
-I can?
-Yes. You don't like it, right?

163
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,723
But unless I put up with this kind
of thing, I won't become popular, right?

164
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,593
Well,

165
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:27,533
to be honest, I don't understand why
being popular is such a good thing.

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,434
But

167
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:34,840
didn't we say
that we'd make Nobuta popular?

168
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,810
Well, yes, but…

169
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,514
Akira!

170
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,351
What did you want to say?

171
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,857
Like I said, forget about me.
It's not a big deal.

172
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,593
Not at all.

173
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,062
Tell us. I want to know now.

174
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,698
No. I mean it.

175
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,567
Let's not. I take it back.

176
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,239
This kind of thing shouldn't be said.

177
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,376
Akira!

178
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,581
No!

179
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,187
Akira…

180
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,227
Fine. Fine, I will.

181
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,663
Fine, I'll say it.

182
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,174
What's that?

183
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,446
Inside here is something
that I want to forget.

184
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,015
AKIRA KUSANO

185
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,456
That stinks! What is that?

186
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,193
What is that?

187
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:10,236
A biology test. Twenty-eight out of 100.

188
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,274
What? You wanted to forget that?

189
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,876
That's not it.

190
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,378
What?

191
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,446
It's gone!

192
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,252
It's gone. So tell us your thing now.

193
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,555
What's with that?

194
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,333
Actually…

195
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,711
In the new year…

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,648
I'll be moving.

197
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,618
After this semester,

198
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,555
I'll be leaving

199
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,758
this school.

200
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,963
You mean, the decision

201
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,900
is final?

202
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,669
Yes.

203
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,078
Nobuta!

204
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,518
Don't you have to go after Nobuta?

205
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,054
You're seriously moving away?

206
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,857
Yes.

207
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,091
This stinks.

208
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,777
He knew?

209
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,799
You must be cold.

210
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,489
Here.

211
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,594
I'll bring you a jacket.

212
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,933
AKIRA KUSANO

213
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,668
Welcome home.

214
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,569
Welcome home.

215
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,178
I'm home.

216
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,984
Were you drinking?

217
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,754
When you get transferred,
there are all kinds of things to do.

218
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,659
Farewell drinks with friends.
Clink! Farewell!

219
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,730
Friends

220
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,935
aren't something you can make
just because you want to, are they?

221
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,073
You want to stay here?

222
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:10,943
What?

223
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,645
You've only got a year left.

224
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,284
We could find you a boarding house.
You would be fine.

225
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,754
How come? Doing that for Shuji is unfair!

226
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,724
Yes, that's right.

227
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,794
And there are things
you need me for, right?

228
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,130
Like for housework.

229
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,103
You really have suffered
through a lot, haven't you?

230
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,741
First,

231
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,912
think about what you want.

232
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,048
Okay?

233
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,493
The people

234
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,430
who will feel the loneliest

235
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,365
aren't us,

236
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,368
but Shuji, right?

237
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,238
He's the type

238
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,476
who never shows
that kind of thing, isn't he?

239
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,982
I want him to go cheerfully.

240
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,921
I want to send him off with a smile.

241
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,259
You think we can?

242
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,130
We will.

243
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,302
Right.

244
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,337
We will.

245
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,308
Arf!

246
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,377
-What do you want us to do?
-What?

247
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,178
-What do you want us to do?
-Arf! Arf!

248
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,514
-There's nothing I want.
-What do you want?

249
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,150
Unless you say something,
Nobuta won't give up.

250
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,620
Before you go, I want to do something
that we will all remember.

251
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,025
-I really don't want anything like that.
-I can think of something easily.

252
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,460
Okay.

253
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,629
Like what?

254
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,864
Like…

255
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,568
have Nobuta become a shrine maiden.

256
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,137
What? A shrine maiden?

257
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,105
-Yes.
-At a shrine?

258
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,675
And then she'll give you the
"Nobuta power charge!"

259
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,878
Nobuta as a shrine maiden?

260
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,948
You know, that just might work.

261
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,517
It totally would.

262
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,385
Nobuta?

263
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,231
-You're leaving?
-Did you take that seriously?

264
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,666
That was just a joke.

265
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,501
-You knew it was a joke, right?
-Yes.

266
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,908
Excuse me!

267
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,779
Excuse me!

268
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,219
Can I help you?

269
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,520
Well…

270
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,324
Why are you here?

271
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,326
This is my family's home.

272
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:15,928
You're a Shinto priest?

273
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,496
Yes!

274
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,436
My dad said that I could
stay behind if I wanted to.

275
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,539
Seriously? You wouldn't have to move?

276
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,644
But I'm not so sure
I should just do whatever I please.

277
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,247
Don't be stupid!

278
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,516
Doing as you please is natural!

279
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,251
For any person,

280
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,087
it's stupid not to do as you please!

281
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:55,000
Nobuta power charge!

282
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,537
You really became one.

283
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,606
Seriously?

284
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,978
I'll do whatever you want.

285
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,815
That's how much
I appreciate what you've done, Shuji.

286
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,155
I've got to go. I'm still on the clock.

287
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,329
She's such a goofball.

288
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,565
She sure is.

289
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,903
Hey! Stop!

290
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,706
Help!

291
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,410
Stop!

292
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,413
-Get him!
-Hey! Get him!

293
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,414
Cut it out!

294
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,449
-Shut up!
-Cut it out!

295
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,918
Cut it out!

296
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,591
Am I dreaming?

297
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,867
Koji?

298
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,577
Just talking in your sleep?

299
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,282
You're worried about moving?

300
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,028
It will be all right.

301
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,366
Don't you worry.

302
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,203
<i>No, it's still yucky.</i>

303
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,906
-<i>It is not yucky!</i>
-There it is! "Yuck!"

304
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,975
Her "yuck" never gets old!

305
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,444
I wonder why it never gets old!

306
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>Is that right?</i>

307
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,252
<i>Does it still hold memories for you?</i>

308
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,120
You know what?

309
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,359
I think I'm going to move.

310
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,130
Why?

311
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,232
I'm worried about my brother too.

312
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,938
I mean, when my dad
doesn't come home from work until late,

313
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,540
he'll have to eat all by himself.

314
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,144
Yes, that may be so, but

315
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,450
why don't you consider your own needs

316
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,421
a little more?

317
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:38,163
Does doing things for other people

318
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:43,101
mean you're not considering
your own needs?

319
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,478
You know…

320
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,284
When I was working so hard
doing things for Nobuta,

321
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,020
I felt I was really being myself.

322
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,990
That's how I felt.

323
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,826
Didn't you feel that way too?

324
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,841
SNOB

325
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,309
MORON

326
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,730
The same with Nobuta.
When she's trying to make people happy,

327
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,200
doesn't she seem the most alive to you?

328
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,541
Aren't you going to come to school?

329
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:04,983
If I went to school,
I might start bullying you again.

330
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,855
That's okay. You can bully me.

331
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:16,461
I'll take all your bullying.

332
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,965
I swear. I can take it.

333
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,439
You sure are dumb, Kotani.

334
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,042
You really are.

335
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,346
So, please

336
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,082
come to school.

337
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,285
I'll think about it.

338
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,458
MAY AOI RETURN TO SCHOOL

339
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,927
MAY AKIRA HAVE LOTS OF FUN

340
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,698
MAY SHUJI BE FINE WHEREVER HE GOES

341
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,903
Darn you!

342
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,511
Oh, dear!

343
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:08,847
It broke?

344
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,951
This is a pretty darn important tree.

345
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,321
What will happen?

346
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,322
You'll be cursed.

347
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,623
Cursed?

348
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,226
And it won't be you who's cursed.

349
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,297
It'll happen to the person
who's most precious to you.

350
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,566
I can't let that happen!

351
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,536
Well, then give this to that person.

352
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,806
Can I have one more?

353
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,944
Since it's for the person most precious
to you, you only get one!

354
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,745
Only one!

355
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,447
While you're standing there,

356
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,685
something may have
already happened to that person.

357
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,456
Hey! She threw it down!

358
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:52,991
Darn it!

359
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,025
Oh, dear.

360
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,509
CHIZUKA SHRINE PROTECTION FROM EVIL

361
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,277
-I saw them by the river.
-The river?

362
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,059
Shuji!

363
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,861
Akira!

364
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,502
What's wrong?

365
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,338
It's nothing.

366
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,339
What?

367
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,576
Have you been cursed?

368
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,548
-Cursed? What do you mean?
-Yes.

369
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,885
I broke a branch off a tree at the shrine.

370
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,622
He said the person most precious
to me would be cursed.

371
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,060
So he told me to give this
to the person most precious to me.

372
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,729
Question.

373
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,967
Who is the person most precious to you?

374
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,409
But there's only one of those.

375
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,579
I only get one
since only one person can be it.

376
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,316
I can't choose.

377
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,522
Then give it to Akira.

378
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,324
Hold on a second!

379
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,928
How come you're always
taking the cool way out?

380
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:42,334
You make me look like a coward
who's afraid of some kind of curse.

381
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,235
Fine. I'll take it.

382
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,403
Hold on!

383
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:51,376
If I really am the most precious person,
I'll get brutally cursed.

384
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,245
Then which is it?
You really are a pain, man. A real pain.

385
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,581
-Then what will we do?
-I'll get a saw.

386
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,949
We don't have one.

387
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,018
I've got one.

388
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,419
Here.

389
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,589
I'm always prepared.

390
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,225
Wait! Hold on!

391
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,228
What are you doing? Hold on! Stop!

392
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,830
You'll be cursed if you do that.

393
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,468
But both of you are precious to me.

394
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,037
Then you'll just have to cut it. Do it!

395
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,941
"Do it"? No! Don't do it!
Stop! Let go of that!

396
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,711
That was close.

397
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,679
Fine.

398
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,083
I'm sorry.

399
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,897
Let's all be cursed together.

400
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,276
Oh, dear!

401
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,944
I broke it.

402
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:05,583
Who is the most precious person to me?

403
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,585
Look closely.

404
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,454
I am bleeding.

405
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,555
No, you're not.

406
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,957
-I was cursed.
-No, you weren't.

407
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,559
-I was cursed.
-No, you weren't.

408
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,166
Whoa! What happened?

409
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,902
I kind of fell down some stairs.

410
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:24,869
Seriously?

411
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,571
But I'm just fine!

412
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,606
-I can stand up. See?
-You okay?

413
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,709
-You all right?
-Yes, I'm okay.

414
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,344
-You okay?
-I'm just fine. See? I'm standing.

415
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,679
What happened?

416
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,147
You must have been cursed!

417
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,048
What?

418
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,983
Hey! Out of the way!

419
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,285
You okay?

420
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,956
Is the guy you like Shittaka?

421
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,159
-I fell down some stairs.
-Really?

422
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,962
Gee, who knows?

423
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,364
You're saying there's a chance?

424
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,202
Please give this form to your dad. Okay?

425
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,103
Okay.

426
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,405
You're moving away, Kiritani?

427
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,539
Yes.

428
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,243
Thank you for all you've done.

429
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,444
Thank you.

430
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,813
You're moving away?

431
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,781
Yes.

432
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,953
You're moving? I'll miss you.

433
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,892
Here.

434
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,829
A parting gift.

435
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,099
A bean jam bun?

436
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,441
Mariko…

437
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,376
Sorry.

438
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,750
You okay?

439
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,590
I'm…

440
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,225
What?

441
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,629
I'm going to be moving away.

442
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,736
I thought I should
at least tell you this myself.

443
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,273
Bye.

444
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,487
Everybody!

445
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,222
Hey everybody!

446
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,924
Hey! Listen!

447
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,127
-What is it?
-Shuji's moving away!

448
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,763
-What?
-Seriously?

449
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,764
Seriously!

450
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,468
-No way! I had no idea.
-When?

451
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,536
After the semester.

452
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,139
-Seriously?
-That's not so far off!

453
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,074
Why hasn't he told us?

454
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,642
Yes! Why hasn't he told us?

455
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,714
-How come?
-Yes! How come?

456
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,015
Shuji!

457
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,785
What? What is it?

458
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,119
What is it?

459
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,454
You're moving away?

460
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,323
Didn't I tell you guys?

461
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,059
-No! You didn't!
-Darn you!

462
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:01,960
When are you moving?

463
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,128
In the new year.

464
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,031
-That's really soon!
-Why didn't you tell us?

465
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,900
You should tell us!

466
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,203
You're such a fucking idiot!
That's important shit you should tell us!

467
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,975
It's been a while
since Shuji was surrounded by people.

468
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:18,877
Yes.

469
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,079
It's good.

470
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,050
Did I ever confiscate anything from you?

471
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,719
No, I don't think so.

472
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,220
-And this isn't yours.
-Right.

473
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,055
This either.

474
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,298
The bad thing about you is
that you try to win every game you play.

475
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,033
So for you,

476
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,168
this.

477
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,472
But remember, in some games,
the two is the strongest.

478
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,910
Only play where you can win.

479
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,512
There. A present from me.

480
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,880
Wait.

481
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,983
I think I said
something pretty great just now.

482
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,018
Yes.

483
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,219
Right?

484
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,954
-Kiritani!
-Yes?

485
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,791
This is a parting gift.

486
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,826
-What? Really?
-Yes.

487
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,028
Thank you.

488
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,464
Wow! It's hand-knitted!

489
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,365
Wow.

490
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,303
What? Why is there an "H" on it?

491
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,572
My initials are "K.S."

492
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,008
You're still young,
so don't sweat the little things.

493
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,781
Wait! Did you break up or something?

494
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,253
I'll do my best too!

495
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,059
She must have broken up.

496
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,127
Hey.

497
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,029
-Kiritani.
-Yes?

498
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,565
I heard you're moving.

499
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,901
Thank you for everything.

500
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,470
Okay then.

501
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,175
Use this for anything you'd like to eat.

502
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,109
Can I?

503
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,410
It's just a lame joke.

504
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,854
I'll be back quickly.

505
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,092
Wait!

506
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,360
Wait!

507
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,428
What? Why did you come home?

508
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,999
-There it is!
-What's wrong?

509
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,068
I hid something I didn't want you to see!

510
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,572
I was in Kathmandu
when I suddenly remembered it!

511
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,574
You should have called.

512
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,708
But then you'd see it.

513
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,877
What's wrong with that? We're married.

514
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,946
Okay, I'm going back. Oh, yeah.

515
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,149
When I come home next time,
it will be our new place, right?

516
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,085
I need to make sure I don't forget that.
Bye!

517
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,088
She's so sweet.

518
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,357
What?

519
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,760
She dropped this.

520
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,296
It says "Satoru Kiritani."
That's you, Dad.

521
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,566
That's a letter I wrote to her
when I was young.

522
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,635
-A letter from Dad.
-Wait a minute!

523
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,438
She returned from Kathmandu to get that?

524
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:04,642
There are some memories
you want to keep for yourself.

525
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,211
She didn't want to toss it
or let anyone see it.

526
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,881
No way. You called her "Nobutan"?

527
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:10,782
What?

528
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,619
Who said you could look? Hey! Kid!

529
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,955
Memories you want to keep for yourself?

530
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,859
<i>The end of semester ceremony
will now begin.</i>

531
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,928
Everyone,

532
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,531
<i>please assemble in the gym.</i>

533
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,233
<i>The end of semester ceremony
will now begin.</i>

534
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,435
Shuji, where's your jacket?

535
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,372
-What? I forgot! You guys go on ahead.
-Bye.

536
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,347
Oh, perfect timing!

537
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,267
What's this?

538
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,402
You can have those.

539
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,637
These things…

540
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,009
When you have two of them,
they say you'll gain happiness.

541
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:18,883
If these will bring happiness,
then why don't you keep them?

542
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,920
You're sharing your happiness with us?

543
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:28,392
Since you each get one,
they're like seeds of happiness.

544
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:35,233
The rest depends on your luck and effort
to increase them and obtain happiness.

545
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:40,638
Grow up into adults
who can share that happiness with others.

546
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,443
Good luck!

547
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,940
Okay!

548
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,842
I wonder what it is.

549
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,745
-I'll open it.
-Go ahead.

550
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,513
I wonder what it is.

551
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,521
Wait…

552
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,057
You mean,

553
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,961
each of us still ended up with just one?

554
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:49,840
You know,

555
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:55,580
I've never really understood what it meant

556
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,783
to like someone.

557
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:06,757
But thanks to Nobuta,
I think I've figured it out.

558
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:16,067
Having a fun time eating stuff together.

559
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,770
Seeing the same sight together

560
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:24,909
and thinking,
"I'll never forget this sight."

561
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,880
And laughing together until you drop.

562
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,320
And sometimes worrying about them.

563
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,491
And thinking,

564
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,697
"I sure wish I could spend
more time with them."

565
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:56,407
I realized that liking someone is
really just those trivial things.

566
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,550
From now on…

567
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,723
whenever I start to like someone…

568
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,195
I'll probably remember you, Nobuta.

569
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:26,537
It'll remind me that you're the one…

570
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,941
who taught me all that.

571
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,050
Kotani…

572
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,459
Thanks.

573
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,004
It's the same with me.

574
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,240
Thank you.

575
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,081
It pains me that this is all I can say.

576
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:17,755
I wish I could convey to you
everything that I'm thinking.

577
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,560
I wish I could tell you

578
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,098
just how much I appreciate
what you've done.

579
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,408
I understand.

580
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,210
Well,

581
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,814
you see, it's the same with me.

582
00:39:54,792 --> 00:40:00,564
I feel like
I need to tell Mariko this too.

583
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,137
Where will we go?

584
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,605
The beach.

585
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,206
The beach?

586
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,111
Well, I kept saying we should go,
but we never did.

587
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,674
I didn't have much time.

588
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,843
But imagine this is the beach.

589
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,614
I thought it would be nice
to have a bento lunch with you too.

590
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,652
You made it?

591
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,787
Yes.

592
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,466
This really does

593
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,469
seem like the beach.

594
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:28,853
Are you cold?

595
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,221
Yes.

596
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,556
But this is fun.

597
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,561
I'm so stupid.

598
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,331
I had so much time to do this before.

599
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:48,639
If I had wanted to, I could have had
so much more fun with you, Mariko.

600
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,009
That's what you've been thinking?

601
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,146
The next time we meet,

602
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,784
I hope I'm a better person.

603
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,595
It's good.

604
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,863
Really? It is?

605
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,365
Yes.

606
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,602
I'm sure I'll never forget

607
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:20,638
this food.

608
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,278
This here, it's not as good as your
broccoli dumplings, but I made this up.

609
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,647
-What is it?
-Zucchini and ground shrimp.

610
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,548
Really?

611
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,553
Kotani, thank you for earlier.

612
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,021
We did that with…

613
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,724
<i>The last thing I saw at school was</i>

614
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,494
<i>Mariko and Nobuta having fun
talking with each other.</i>

615
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:50,734
<i>For some reason,
that made me really, really happy.</i>

616
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,140
<i>Akira and I…</i>

617
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,374
-Bye.
-Bye.

618
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,276
<i>We said "bye" as if we'd meet tomorrow.</i>

619
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,381
<i>And neither of us looked back.</i>

620
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,087
Oh, no!

621
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,523
Mr. Saotome! That's the wrong character!

622
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,857
-What?
-This.

623
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,460
Oh, no! It says "Dotani"!

624
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:20,564
You've got to be kidding me!
What are we going to do now?

625
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,966
I'm sorry!

626
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,469
Kiritani's departure isn't tomorrow.
It's today!

627
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,405
Today? You mean he's already left?

628
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,374
Yes. He's probably about to leave.

629
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,843
Then we won't be in time!

630
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,244
-Thank goodness!
-What?

631
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,512
No, I didn't mean that.

632
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,221
Come on. Aren't you going to see him off?

633
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,157
I don't want to go.

634
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,133
Just because it's painful
doesn't mean you should run away.

635
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,405
Are you going to act like
you never even knew Shuji?

636
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,007
Are you?

637
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,143
Discarding the painful stuff means

638
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,214
you're discarding all the fun times too.

639
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,982
You want that?

640
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,291
I can't act like…

641
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,663
those things never happened.

642
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,098
Then see things out to the very end.

643
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,166
Okay?

644
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,143
Hey.

645
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,110
We're going.

646
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,145
-Okay.
-Okay.

647
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,914
-We'll be going, Shuji.
-Okay.

648
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,205
Hello?

649
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,407
Hello? Look left!

650
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,109
Shuji! Over here!

651
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,110
<i>Look over here!</i>

652
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,080
<i>Look left! Look left!</i>

653
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,148
Shuji!

654
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,089
Excuse me. Can you stop for a minute?

655
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,698
Damn you! We'll miss you!

656
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,335
-You came?
-Yes! We're here!

657
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,770
We're here, Shuji!

658
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,525
Okay. All right!

659
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,161
Let's all take photos together!

660
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,764
Ready. Go.

661
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,468
-Ready. Go. Bitchin'!
-Ready. Go. Bitchin'!

662
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,371
Ready, go. The squares.

663
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,807
-Double your power!
-Double your power!

664
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,408
Say "kimchi"!

665
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,910
-Yip!
-Yip!

666
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,545
Smile, handsome dudes!

667
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,181
Say "rhinoceros beetle."

668
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,449
-Yip!
-Yip!

669
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,684
Gather together, everyone!

670
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,288
-Get closer!
-Why are you putting your eye up to it?

671
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,123
You can see it from here!

672
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,024
Here goes!

673
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,361
-Is this…
-Destiny?

674
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,603
Thank you so much.

675
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,015
Bicycle!

676
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,516
-Bicycle!
-Bicycle!

677
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,984
Shuji!

678
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,008
<i>Nobuta power charge!</i>

679
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,108
<i>Everything in this world is a game.</i>

680
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:05,148
<i>Anyone who thinks they've lost
and gives up midway is a fool.</i>

681
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,383
AMIGO HIGH SCHOOL

682
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,360
Sorry.

683
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,628
I'm kind of nervous.

684
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,834
<i>Those who survive to the end</i>

685
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,938
<i>and enjoy the game
to the fullest are the winners.</i>

686
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,976
<i>That's probably
how the rules work in this world.</i>

687
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,149
<i>No matter what happens now,</i>

688
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,520
<i>this new Shuji Kiritani
won't fall into despair.</i>

689
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,623
If you don't sit down
in the next three seconds,

690
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,493
you'll be in real trouble.
Do you want that?

691
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:53,430
Shuji Kiritani has moved here from Tokyo.

692
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,100
I'm Shuji Kiritani.

693
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,336
It's nice to meet you.

694
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,988
<i>Am I hallucinating?</i>

695
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,089
What's wrong?

696
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,427
Oh, I'm sorry.

697
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,762
I'm just kinda nervous.

698
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:26,730
Oh, okay.

699
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,764
Applause!

700
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,578
<i>No way!</i>

701
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,115
<i>I've fallen into despair.</i>

702
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,283
-Yo!
-Yo!

703
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,485
Hi.

704
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:53,357
Say, when did Kusano move here?

705
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,526
-Yesterday!
-It was really amazing.

706
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,463
He landed on the playground
in a helicopter. Like George Bush.

707
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,565
-Yes! Like Bush!
-That's a good one!

708
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,670
Damn! That hurts!

709
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:10,173
Yamazaki and Umigame are going at it!

710
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,174
Where?

711
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,075
The gym!

712
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,210
Seriously?

713
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:18,882
What?

714
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:21,051
It's really bad! Come on!

715
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,286
-You need to handle this, Shuji!
-Wait!

716
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,522
-It's bad!
-Who's Yamazaki and Umigame?

717
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,528
-Wait. Wait a second.
-What?

718
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,332
Am I smiling?

719
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,333
Yes.

720
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,435
You're smiling.

721
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,138
See?

722
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,666
Oh, yeah.

723
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,371
Neither of them is here anymore.

724
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,145
"One must comprehend times such as these."

725
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:27,484
So the verb <i>"nari"</i> here is the predicate
form of the auxiliary verb <i>"nari."</i>

726
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:32,556
That's because the connecting <i>"beki"</i> is
the attributive form of the auxiliary.

727
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,111
Why the heck did you move here?

728
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,915
Now Nobuta's all alone again.

729
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,618
Nobuta's the one who said,

730
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:07,657
"Shuji and Akira are two peas in a pod."

731
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>Nobuta said that?</i>

732
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,930
<i>She said, "I'll be fine alone."</i>

733
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,234
Is she really going to be okay alone?

734
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:23,540
She said, "I'll cry for the first
three days, but I swear I'll get over it."

735
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,246
Nobuta said that?

736
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,180
Yes.

737
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:32,816
I see.

738
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,120
You know what? Way over across this sky,

739
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,623
Nobuta is there.

740
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,533
Hey! Doesn't that cloud
look like it's smiling?

741
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,569
-It does?
-Yes! That one!

742
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,273
I'm

743
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,708
able to smile now.

744
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,181
I'm able to…

745
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,019
smile properly now!

746
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,667
Us guys…

747
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:25,602
Yes?

748
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,307
I think we can survive
pretty much anywhere.

749
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,009
What?

750
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,048
Bam!

751
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,417
She can't hear you.

752
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,752
She'll wonder.

753
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:25,262
<i>We can survive anywhere.</i>

754
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,962
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

755
