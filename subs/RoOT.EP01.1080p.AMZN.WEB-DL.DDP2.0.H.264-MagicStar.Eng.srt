1
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,600
What?

2
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,570
What? Seriously?

3
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,680
Sato.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,420
Ow!

5
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,620
Rena-san.

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,860
What are you doing hanging around here?

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,970
I won two bonus drinks
in a row for four total.

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,980
Why are you buying so many when we
won't be able to use the bathroom?

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,380
Oh, I couldn't drink this many regardless.

10
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,640
Wait, there's no bathroom?
Not even a convenience store?

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,040
Nothing. It's just bars and love hotels.

12
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,760
Come on. What are you doing?

13
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,500
Hot!

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,920
That's hot.

15
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,090
Anyway, I'm surprised a big-time banker
would visit an out-of-the-way place like this.

16
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,210
This whole area's got a shady history.

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,980
A few people even turned up dead
since the trouble with land sharks.

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,120
What?

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,070
According to his wife, he frequently
meets a woman around here

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,950
because he works at the branch nearby.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,460
We're going to film evidence
of them entering the love hotel,

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,190
spending the night, and coming
out together in the morning.

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,600
But isn't it possible that
they'll arrive separately?

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,810
Well, yeah. We'll need to keep the camera
recording for at least an hour for insurance.

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,470
What? Why?

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,180
If their stay is short, they might
not have gotten intimate.

27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,700
That's not gonna happen.

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,080
In any case, we have two
options in situations like these.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,740
We can keep filming from the car,
or we can wait for them in the lounge.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,630
Well, you can.

31
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,480
I've never been in one of
those establishments before.

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,500
Yeah, that's not my problem.

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,530
Look this way.

34
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,630
Cut it out.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,240
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,290
Nothing in particular.

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,960
You can't be doing "nothing."

38
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,080
A couple like you must be up to something.

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,960
Is this a deal or something?

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
You're not hiding syringes
or anything like that, are you?

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,660
Where'd this come from?
We'll leave, okay?

42
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,970
Hey, wait. You in the back.

43
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,620
What is that? Is that a camera?

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,240
You're not secretly
photographing people, are you?

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,470
No, we're just capturing memories.

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,460
Then show me what you've got on there.

47
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,740
Actually, uh… we're bound by confidentiality.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,700
If you can't show me,
that means you're guilty!

49
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,560
You, out of the car.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,660
Come on!

51
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,750
Ow!

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,490
Show me.

53
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,030
I can't.

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,610
If you're just capturing memories,
there's no problem.

55
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,530
I can't show you.

56
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,030
Show me, dammit.
Just show me the damn pictures.

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,790
Rena-san, help me.

58
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,520
Show me.

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,370
I really can't.

60
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,950
Hey, what are you doing?

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,610
Are you filming an authoritarian cop
so you can post the video online, huh?

62
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,610
Hey.

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,660
Come on, man. It's your first day.

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,730
Are you even trying? Depending
on how your training period goes…

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,900
While I was practicing taking pictures...

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,500
The only thing around here is stray cats.

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,830
Actually, I managed to get
a proper private eye kind of photo.

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,050
A young woman entering a sketchy multi-use
building wearing a hat and sunglasses.

69
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,430
She's gotta be a celebrity.

70
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,430
That's the purview of paparazzi,
not private eyes.

71
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,410
They're definitely asleep.

72
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,580
Even though it's a weekday,
they're staying overnight.

73
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,410
We missed our best shot because of you.

74
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,150
You'd better at least get
a picture of them leaving.

75
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,360
I didn't think I'd be questioned
by the police on my first day.

76
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,820
Why don't we call it quits for today?

77
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,860
Why did you interview with our agency?

78
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,570
Because it's cool.

79
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,740
I grew up watching anime.
You know, Detective What's-His-Name.

80
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,040
That's all?

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,700
No. I thought it'd make me
popular with the ladies, too.

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,810
Honestly, I didn't think
this job would be so drab.

83
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,790
I thought detectives did cool stuff.

84
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,260
Aren't detectives—

85
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,320
Wait, what?

86
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,200
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,390
Back up, backup, back up.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

88
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,270
You know it's not like that.

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,250
When can I see you next?

90
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,470
Crap. They're leaving.

91
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,050
Next?

92
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,260
I'm going after them!

93
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,610
Crap!

94
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,200
We did it. We got them.

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,160
I can't tell if you're lucky or not.

96
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,570
Here.

97
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,200
Let's go. We got the evidence.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,480
I'll write up a report
as soon as I get home.

99
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,370
No. You can't take that out of the office,
so you'll have to write it there.

100
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,290
This is huge for my first day.
I can't sit still!

101
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,450
Let's have a toast. Would you like
coffee or soda? I'll go buy some.

102
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,160
Why are those my options?

103
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,450
Hello, this is Ibusuki. Please respond.

104
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,010
Sorry, boss. Were you asleep?

105
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,180
Oh. It's you, Rena.

106
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,800
We just finished.

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,220
Did you get the pictures?

108
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,070
Yes, just now.

109
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,720
How's he doing?

110
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,340
Sato, was it?

111
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,290
His instincts are miserable,
but he seems lucky.

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,320
I see. That's a relief.

113
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,440
What?

114
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,380
Seriously? Lucky me.

115
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,630
Hey.

116
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,240
Oh, I'm sorry. I keep
winning free drinks today.

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,410
I don't recognize you.

118
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,380
What?

119
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,880
That's a pretty nice camera
you've got there.

120
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,650
Oh, yes.

121
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,210
Who are you a reporter for?

122
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,350
Actually, I don't work for a magazine.
I'm a private eye.

123
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,130
Then what are you investigating?

124
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,280
I have a duty to confidentiality.

125
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,700
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

126
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,350
Actually, I doubt it has
anything to do with you.

127
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,810
I was asked to investigate a banker's affair.

128
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,430
Yeah? That's great!

129
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,250
No, stop! There isn't anything on here.

130
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,830
Oh, yeah?

131
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,840
Yes.

132
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,140
In fact, why should I give you
my camera, anyway?

133
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,670
Did the banker hire you?

134
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,380
If you have a legitimate
reason, let's hear it—

135
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,280
I was never doing this
for a legitimate reason.

136
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,470
The pictures are on this.

137
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,330
What? They're on this thing?

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,410
Our generation is physical, you know?

139
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,660
My agency just provided me
with that. Hey, wait.

140
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,460
You haven't made any copies
or sent these anywhere, have you?

141
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,960
I wish I had.

142
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,570
You know what'll happen
if I find out you have later, right?

143
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,180
Yamabiko

144
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,780
Ow, ow, ow. It's definitely not broken.

145
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,590
It's broken.

146
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,220
amabiko

147
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,260
mabiko

148
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,300
biko

149
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,340
ko

150
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,440
Not broken.

151
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,500
Excuse us.

152
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,980
Excuse us.

153
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,480
Here you are.

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,610
Can I get you a beer—no, an oolong tea?

155
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,580
Yes, please.

156
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,830
Thank you. There weren't any other
shops around, so we had to come here.

157
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,390
I'm really sorry about this.
He doesn't have a shred of tact.

158
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,240
We appreciate you opening your shop for us.

159
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,620
Oh, right. You can't drink.

160
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,430
I'm surprised you can.

161
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,800
How do you know my age, anyway?

162
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,660
You're 19, right? The boss told me.

163
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,280
Even kids as young as you
work as private eyes, huh?

164
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,270
It's so exciting, isn't it?
To be suddenly attacked by a thug.

165
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,200
I love that sort of thing.

166
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,190
He's a rookie who just started today.
I wouldn't call him a private eye yet.

167
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,020
And don't give personal information
out to people you just met.

168
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,340
You're not an amateur.

169
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,130
Why do you think you were hired?

170
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,700
Probably my interview.

171
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm pretty confident about what I said.

172
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,590
Thank you.

173
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,630
There was a written test, right?

174
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,610
Yeah, the 50 two-choice questions?

175
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,560
You got all of them wrong.

176
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,360
You were hired because the boss said
he'd never seen anything like it.

177
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,140
Have some self-awareness.

178
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,190
Well, Mr. Unreliable Detective,

179
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,060
have you ever been hired
to investigate anything really crazy?

180
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,470
Like a murder, or something
else you'd see in a movie.

181
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,510
We have a duty of confidentiality.

182
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,130
Well, shucks. I thought I'd get
to hear some juicy gossip.

183
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,870
You don't have any stories like that?

184
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,350
Why are you asking, too?

185
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,650
U-Um...

186
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,280
Ma'am, is there anything
you're curious about?

187
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,600
Like someone or something
you'd like to have investigated.

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,380
Call me Taeko.

189
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm not sure if I should say this, but a few
of my regulars are curious people.

190
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,430
Your regulars?

191
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,660
You mean this place is surprisingly popular?

192
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,230
If it weren't, I would've
closed shop a long time ago.

193
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,210
Oh, right.

194
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,780
All the shops around here have been closing.
The neighborhood keeps shrinking.

195
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,130
But some people just keep coming.

196
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,760
So, which regular are you most curious about?

197
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,790
I'm not sure how to describe him.

198
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,720
I'd like to know what he spends his
 time doing. How does he see the world?

199
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,020
He's just such an odd person.

200
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,100
If he's a regular, why not ask him yourself?

201
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,340
That's the thing. I wish I could, but I can't.

202
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,990
Just between us, I feel like
there's a hidden side to him.

203
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,440
He never wants to talk about his past.

204
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,250
Like we said, we're private eyes.

205
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,840
If you tell us more about him,
we'll investigate whatever you want.

206
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,970
Odokawa-san. His given name is Hiroshi.

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,310
Born year of the tiger, so I think he's 41.

208
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,680
Odokawa Hiroshi.
Year of the tiger, 41 years old.

209
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,070
You don't need to repeat it.

210
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,440
Here.

211
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,050
Thank you.

212
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,770
Odokawa Hiroshi
 41, Single
 Taxi Driver

213
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,520
Idiot!

214
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,350
Just forget it.

215
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Ibusuki Detective Agency

217
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,180
If you'd just look at these…

218
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,020
No, wait—

219
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,260
Call us if anything else comes up!

220
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,580
What?

221
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,870
I'm really sorry. I screwed up.

222
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,930
I guess you weren't ready to lead.

223
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,460
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

224
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,150
I promise I'll make up for it
on the next job.

225
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:44,570
Well, that background check into
what's-his-name sounds perfect for training.

226
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,270
Then we'll call it even.

227
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,210
Yes, sir.

228
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,030
Here he comes.

229
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,870
At a glance, he seems like your typical
slightly creepy but ordinary middle-aged guy.

230
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,420
You're contradicting yourself, but yeah.

231
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,790
He lives a totally boring, ordinary life.

232
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,340
Well, yeah. But the client
might still find it remarkable.

233
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,680
We're back.

234
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,710
Good work out there.

235
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,050
Welcome back.

236
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,900
The job's going smoothly.

237
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,860
Huh? Are you still mad, boss?

238
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,220
No. A new job came in.

239
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,510
Rather, an acquaintance's daughter
hasn't been home in two days.

240
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,780
He can't get in touch with her, either.

241
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,700
What? A runaway?

242
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,750
She said she'd be back home soon.

243
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,250
She's just a high school student.

244
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,020
Something might've happened to her.

245
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,070
What? Then we should start
looking for her right away,

246
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,230
instead of wasting time on
this taxi driver's biography.

247
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,420
Do your own job.

248
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,640
That's right. I'm still single.

249
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,410
Not even a girlfriend.

250
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh, shut up.

251
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,840
So you're looking for one.

252
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,500
Sir, how's your relationship
with your daughter?

253
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,700
What happened out there today?

254
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,200
You weren't your usual straightforward self.

255
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,180
The producer said they'd never
seen you so quiet before.

256
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,310
They said they'd come to check on—
I mean, say hello later.

257
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,900
What's wrong? How about something sweet?

258
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,820
Here. What were those idols called?

259
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,970
Those young girls brought you a gift.

260
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,350
What's wrong with you?
You're in a terrible mood.

261
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,230
Goriki Clinic

262
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,230
Does he have a chronic illness?

263
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,810
Goriki Clinic

264
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,610
Go check it out.

265
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,910
Is this really an investigation?

266
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,940
Why are you alone?

267
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,190
It's simple.

268
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,540
If you've got nothing to hide,
 open your door.

269
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,060
This dash cam allows you to film
the inside of your vehicle, doesn't it?

270
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,370
That's right.

271
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,910
How long do you store your recordings?

272
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,700
About two weeks.

273
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,740
She'll be on here, then.

274
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,450
What?

275
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,080
That missing high school
girl got in your car.

276
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,050
My car?

277
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,340
I'm taking your data. This is a seizure.

278
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,850
If anything comes up,
I expect your cooperation again.

279
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,650
Don't go to the police, though.

280
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,530
Hello, ma'am.

281
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,450
Hello.

282
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,500
Hello.

283
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,820
Taeko-san was right. He doesn't
seem like an ordinary taxi driver.

284
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,610
I'm back.

285
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,450
Welcome back.

286
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,190
Welcome back.

287
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,900
Any developments in the missing
high school girl case?

288
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,880
It's all over the news.

289
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,380
Yeah, because her life's in danger.

290
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,580
The media started
receiving information today.

291
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,510
Just after 1 AM two days ago on the 4th,

292
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,910
after doing some shopping at a
convenience store, she got in a taxi.

293
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,750
Have they identified the taxi?

294
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,080
Apparently the clerk remembered the number.

295
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,480
Huh? After seeing it only once and briefly?

296
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,660
It happened to be their birthday, 1022.

297
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,390
What?

298
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,210
Wow.

299
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,030
A high school girl has gone missing
in Nerima City, Tokyo.

300
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,620
She has been unreachable
since she left her home late at night

301
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,080
two days ago on the 4th of this month.

302
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,730
The next morning, her family…

303
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,750
We, the Homosapiens, just received
the results of Round 1 of the N-1.

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,260
And would you believe it? We passed!

305
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,350
Of course we did.

306
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,050
Even amateurs could make it past Round 1.

307
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,890
Where do you think the finish line is?

308
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:38,800
Equator Sauna

309
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,100
But last year, we failed in Round 2.

310
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,400
After ten years in the business...

311
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,560
Equator Sauna

312
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,570
Who is it?

313
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,870
We work for Ibusuki.

314
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,120
Hello.

315
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,280
Hello.

316
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,870
You look young. Have a seat.

317
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,100
Excuse us.

318
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,660
So?

319
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,950
We need a remote monitoring
dash cam and GPS installed.

320
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,810
What? Hold on. That's totally illegal.

321
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,510
Where?

322
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,740
His car. This is the dash cam.

323
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,640
It's a common model.

324
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,660
You'll install it, won't you?

325
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,020
If you pay for it.

326
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,730
You'll be paid tomorrow.

327
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,450
No can do. Equator operates 24 hours
a day, but that's just the sauna.

328
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
How long will it take?

329
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm busy. Give me three days.

330
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,840
Make it one.

331
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,330
1.5 days, or pay a rush late night surcharge.

332
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,940
How much?

333
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,410
550,000. And I'll need your help, too.

334
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,620
Pretty old car.
Didn't need all these tools.

335
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,040
How long will it take?

336
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,700
About seven or eight minutes.

337
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,080
Seven or eight minutes?

338
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,010
Yeah.

339
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,080
What is it?

340
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,140
Are you hungry?

341
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,740
Hold on.

342
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,490
Okay, all good.

343
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,810
That should do it.

344
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,970
Fine. I'll go buy you something.
Stay put and be good.

345
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,320
Crap, crap, crap.

346
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,020
Odokawa's coming, Odokawa's
coming, Odokawa's coming!

347
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,700
Crap, crap, crap!

348
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,160
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

349
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,200
Was he really talking to someone?

350
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,240
Yeah. He even ominously told them
to “stay put and be good.”

351
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,980
Anyway, I could imagine him kidnapping
and holding someone as cute as her

352
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,710
if she happened to get in his taxi.

353
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,940
He may be involved, but kidnapping
 and false imprisonment?

354
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,430
No, you're right. I guess not.

355
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,170
Did you call her cute?

356
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,670
Did I say that?

357
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,970
Yeah, didn't you just say that?

358
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,410
No, you definitely did.

359
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:14,860
What?

360
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,410
Her photo hasn't appeared on the news yet.

361
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,930
Why'd you say that?

362
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,780
I didn't say that.

363
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,910
No, you did.

364
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,430
What? Really?

365
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,180
Yeah.

366
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,270
I caught a glimpse of the boss' documents.

367
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,190
I knew it.

368
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,600
They were out in the open on his desk.

369
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Hold on.

370
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,650
Hey.

371
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,550
Where'd they go?

372
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,940
Don't go through his stuff.

373
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,050
This is it.

374
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,250
Don't.

375
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,650
Wait, wait, wait.

376
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,470
Look at this Buddha.

377
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,000
Tada! A Buddha.

378
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,060
Wait a minute.

379
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,400
Mitsuya?

380
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,980
This is Yuki.

381
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Mitsuya-san.

382
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,300
Next Time

383
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,280
Have we met?

384
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,240
Why'd you end the investigation?

385
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,740
Rumor is he's done a lot of gray work.

386
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,830
He's probably never paid
for his mistakes before.

387
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,580
You should stay away from them.

388
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,900
You're cute, too, Rena-san.

389
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,900
This show is a work of fiction.

390
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,580
What?

391
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,870
I told you, I won't work for you.
