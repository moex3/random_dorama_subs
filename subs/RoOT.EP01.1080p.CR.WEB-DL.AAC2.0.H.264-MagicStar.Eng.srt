1
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,600
What?

2
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,570
What? Seriously?

3
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,680
Sato.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,420
Ow!

5
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,620
Rena-san.

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,860
What are you doing hanging around here?

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,970
I won two bonus drinks
in a row for four total.

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,980
Why are you buying so many when we
won't be able to use the bathroom?

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,380
Oh, I couldn't drink this many regardless.

10
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,640
Wait, there's no bathroom?
Not even a convenience store?

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,040
Nothing. It's just bars and love hotels.

12
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,760
Come on. What are you doing?

13
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,500
Hot!

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,920
That's hot.

15
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,090
Anyway, I'm surprised a big-time banker
would visit an out-of-the-way place like this.

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,210
This whole area's got a shady history.

17
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,980
A few people even turned up dead
since the trouble with land sharks.

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,120
What?

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,070
According to his wife, he frequently
meets a woman around here

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,950
because he works at the branch nearby.

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,460
We're going to film evidence
of them entering the love hotel,

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,190
spending the night, and coming
out together in the morning.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,600
But isn't it possible that
they'll arrive separately?

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,810
Well, yeah. We'll need to keep the camera
recording for at least an hour for insurance.

25
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,470
What? Why?

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,180
If their stay is short, they might
not have gotten intimate.

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,700
That's not gonna happen.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,080
In any case, we have two
options in situations like these.

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,740
We can keep filming from the car,
or we can wait for them in the lounge.

30
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,630
Well, you can.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,480
I've never been in one of
those establishments before.

32
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,500
Yeah, that's not my problem.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,530
Look this way.

34
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,630
Cut it out.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,290
Nothing in particular.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,960
You can't be doing "nothing."

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,080
A couple like you must be up to something.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Is this a deal or something?

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,160
You're not hiding syringes
or anything like that, are you?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,660
Where'd this come from?
We'll leave, okay?

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,970
Hey, wait. You in the back.

43
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,620
What is that? Is that a camera?

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,240
You're not secretly
photographing people, are you?

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,470
No, we're just capturing memories.

46
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,460
Then show me what you've got on there.

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,740
Actually, uh… we're bound by confidentiality.

48
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,700
If you can't show me,
that means you're guilty!

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,560
You, out of the car.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,660
Come on!

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,750
Ow!

52
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,490
Show me.

53
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,030
I can't.

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,610
If you're just capturing memories,
there's no problem.

55
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,530
I can't show you.

56
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,030
Show me, dammit.
Just show me the damn pictures.

57
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,790
Rena-san, help me.

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,520
Show me.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,370
I really can't.

60
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,950
Hey, what are you doing?

61
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,610
Are you filming an authoritarian cop
so you can post the video online, huh?

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,610
Hey.

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,660
Come on, man. It's your first day.

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,730
Are you even trying? Depending
on how your training period goes…

65
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,900
While I was practicing taking pictures...

66
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,500
The only thing around here is stray cats.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,830
Actually, I managed to get
a proper private eye kind of photo.

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,050
A young woman entering a sketchy multi-use
building wearing a hat and sunglasses.

69
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,430
She's gotta be a celebrity.

70
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,430
That's the purview of paparazzi,
not private eyes.

71
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,410
They're definitely asleep.

72
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,580
Even though it's a weekday,
they're staying overnight.

73
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,410
We missed our best shot because of you.

74
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,150
You'd better at least get
a picture of them leaving.

75
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,360
I didn't think I'd be questioned
by the police on my first day.

76
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,820
Why don't we call it quits for today?

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,860
Why did you interview with our agency?

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,570
Because it's cool.

79
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,740
I grew up watching anime.
You know, Detective What's-His-Name.

80
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,040
That's all?

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,700
No. I thought it'd make me
popular with the ladies, too.

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,810
Honestly, I didn't think
this job would be so drab.

83
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,790
I thought detectives did cool stuff.

84
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,260
Aren't detectives—

85
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,320
Wait, what?

86
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,200
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,390
Back up, backup, back up.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

88
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,270
You know it's not like that.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,250
When can I see you next?

90
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,470
Crap. They're leaving.

91
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,050
Next?

92
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,260
I'm going after them!

93
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,610
Crap!

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,200
We did it. We got them.

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,160
I can't tell if you're lucky or not.

96
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,570
Here.

97
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,200
Let's go. We got the evidence.

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,480
I'll write up a report
as soon as I get home.

99
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,370
No. You can't take that out of the office,
so you'll have to write it there.

100
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,290
This is huge for my first day.
I can't sit still!

101
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,450
Let's have a toast. Would you like
coffee or soda? I'll go buy some.

102
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,160
Why are those my options?

103
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,450
Hello, this is Ibusuki. Please respond.

104
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,010
Sorry, boss. Were you asleep?

105
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,180
Oh. It's you, Rena.

106
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,800
We just finished.

107
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,220
Did you get the pictures?

108
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,070
Yes, just now.

109
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,720
How's he doing?

110
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,340
Sato, was it?

111
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,290
His instincts are miserable,
but he seems lucky.

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,320
I see. That's a relief.

113
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,440
What?

114
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,380
Seriously? Lucky me.

115
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,630
Hey.

116
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,240
Oh, I'm sorry. I keep
winning free drinks today.

117
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,410
I don't recognize you.

118
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,380
What?

119
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,880
That's a pretty nice camera
you've got there.

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,650
Oh, yes.

121
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,210
Who are you a reporter for?

122
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,350
Actually, I don't work for a magazine.
I'm a private eye.

123
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,130
Then what are you investigating?

124
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,280
I have a duty to confidentiality.

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,700
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

126
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,350
Actually, I doubt it has
anything to do with you.

127
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,810
I was asked to investigate a banker's affair.

128
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,430
Yeah? That's great!

129
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,250
No, stop! There isn't anything on here.

130
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,830
Oh, yeah?

131
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes.

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,140
In fact, why should I give you
my camera, anyway?

133
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,670
Did the banker hire you?

134
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,380
If you have a legitimate
reason, let's hear it—

135
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,280
I was never doing this
for a legitimate reason.

136
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,470
The pictures are on this.

137
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,330
What? They're on this thing?

138
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,410
Our generation is physical, you know?

139
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,660
My agency just provided me
with that. Hey, wait.

140
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,460
You haven't made any copies
or sent these anywhere, have you?

141
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,960
I wish I had.

142
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,570
You know what'll happen
if I find out you have later, right?

143
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,180
Yamabiko

144
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,780
Ow, ow, ow. It's definitely not broken.

145
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,590
It's broken.

146
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,220
amabiko

147
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,260
mabiko

148
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,300
biko

149
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,340
ko

150
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,440
Not broken.

151
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,500
Excuse us.

152
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,980
Excuse us.

153
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,480
Here you are.

154
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,610
Can I get you a beer—no, an oolong tea?

155
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,580
Yes, please.

156
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,830
Thank you. There weren't any other
shops around, so we had to come here.

157
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,390
I'm really sorry about this.
He doesn't have a shred of tact.

158
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,240
We appreciate you opening your shop for us.

159
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,620
Oh, right. You can't drink.

160
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,430
I'm surprised you can.

161
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,800
How do you know my age, anyway?

162
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,660
You're 19, right? The boss told me.

163
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,280
Even kids as young as you
work as private eyes, huh?

164
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,270
It's so exciting, isn't it?
To be suddenly attacked by a thug.

165
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,200
I love that sort of thing.

166
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,190
He's a rookie who just started today.
I wouldn't call him a private eye yet.

167
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,020
And don't give personal information
out to people you just met.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,340
You're not an amateur.

169
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,130
Why do you think you were hired?

170
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,700
Probably my interview.

171
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm pretty confident about what I said.

172
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,590
Thank you.

173
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,630
There was a written test, right?

174
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,610
Yeah, the 50 two-choice questions?

175
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,560
You got all of them wrong.

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,360
You were hired because the boss said
he'd never seen anything like it.

177
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,140
Have some self-awareness.

178
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,190
Well, Mr. Unreliable Detective,

179
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,060
have you ever been hired
to investigate anything really crazy?

180
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,470
Like a murder, or something
else you'd see in a movie.

181
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,510
We have a duty of confidentiality.

182
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,130
Well, shucks. I thought I'd get
to hear some juicy gossip.

183
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,870
You don't have any stories like that?

184
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,350
Why are you asking, too?

185
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,650
U-Um...

186
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,280
Ma'am, is there anything
you're curious about?

187
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,600
Like someone or something
you'd like to have investigated.

188
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,380
Call me Taeko.

189
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:32,940
I'm not sure if I should say this, but a few
of my regulars are curious people.

190
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,430
Your regulars?

191
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,660
You mean this place is surprisingly popular?

192
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,230
If it weren't, I would've
closed shop a long time ago.

193
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,210
Oh, right.

194
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,780
All the shops around here have been closing.
The neighborhood keeps shrinking.

195
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,130
But some people just keep coming.

196
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,760
So, which regular are you most curious about?

197
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,790
I'm not sure how to describe him.

198
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,720
I'd like to know what he spends his
 time doing. How does he see the world?

199
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,020
He's just such an odd person.

200
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,100
If he's a regular, why not ask him yourself?

201
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,340
That's the thing. I wish I could, but I can't.

202
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,990
Just between us, I feel like
there's a hidden side to him.

203
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,440
He never wants to talk about his past.

204
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,250
Like we said, we're private eyes.

205
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,840
If you tell us more about him,
we'll investigate whatever you want.

206
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,970
Odokawa-san. His given name is Hiroshi.

207
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,310
Born year of the tiger, so I think he's 41.

208
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,680
Odokawa Hiroshi.
Year of the tiger, 41 years old.

209
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,070
You don't need to repeat it.

210
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,440
Here.

211
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,050
Thank you.

212
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,770
Odokawa Hiroshi
 41, Single
 Taxi Driver

213
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,520
Idiot!

214
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,350
Just forget it.

215
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Ibusuki Detective Agency

Confidential   Free Consultations

217
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,180
If you'd just look at these…

218
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,020
No, wait—

219
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,260
Call us if anything else comes up!

220
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,580
What?

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,870
I'm really sorry. I screwed up.

222
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,930
I guess you weren't ready to lead.

223
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

224
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,150
I promise I'll make up for it
on the next job.

225
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:43,570
Well, that background check into
what's-his-name sounds perfect for training.

226
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,270
Then we'll call it even.

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,210
Yes, sir.

228
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,030
Here he comes.

229
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,870
At a glance, he seems like your typical
slightly creepy but ordinary middle-aged guy.

230
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,420
You're contradicting yourself, but yeah.

231
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,790
He lives a totally boring, ordinary life.

232
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:27,340
Well, yeah. But the client
might still find it remarkable.

233
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,680
We're back.

234
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,710
Good work out there.

235
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,050
Welcome back.

236
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,900
The job's going smoothly.

237
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,860
Huh? Are you still mad, boss?

238
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,220
No. A new job came in.

239
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,510
Rather, an acquaintance's daughter
hasn't been home in two days.

240
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,780
He can't get in touch with her, either.

241
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,700
What? A runaway?

242
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,750
She said she'd be back home soon.

243
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,250
She's just a high school student.

244
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,020
Something might've happened to her.

245
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,070
What? Then we should start
looking for her right away,

246
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,230
instead of wasting time on
this taxi driver's biography.

247
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,420
Do your own job.

248
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,640
That's right. I'm still single.

249
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,410
Not even a girlfriend.

250
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,500
Oh, shut up.

251
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,840
So you're looking for one.

252
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,500
Sir, how's your relationship
with your daughter?

253
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,700
What happened out there today?

254
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,200
You weren't your usual straightforward self.

255
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,180
The producer said they'd never
seen you so quiet before.

256
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,310
They said they'd come to check on—
I mean, say hello later.

257
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,900
What's wrong? How about something sweet?

258
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,820
Here. What were those idols called?

259
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,970
Those young girls brought you a gift.

260
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,350
What's wrong with you?
You're in a terrible mood.

261
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,230
Goriki Clinic

262
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,230
Does he have a chronic illness?

263
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,810
Goriki Clinic

264
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,610
Go check it out.

265
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,910
Is this really an investigation?

266
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,940
Why are you alone?

267
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,190
It's simple.

268
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,540
If you've got nothing to hide,
 open your door.

269
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,060
This dash cam allows you to film
the inside of your vehicle, doesn't it?

270
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,370
That's right.

271
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,910
How long do you store your recordings?

272
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,700
About two weeks.

273
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,740
She'll be on here, then.

274
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,450
What?

275
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,080
That missing high school
girl got in your car.

276
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,050
My car?

277
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,340
I'm taking your data. This is a seizure.

278
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,850
If anything comes up,
I expect your cooperation again.

279
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,650
Don't go to the police, though.

280
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,530
Hello, ma'am.

281
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,450
Hello.

282
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,500
Hello.

283
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,820
Taeko-san was right. He doesn't
seem like an ordinary taxi driver.

284
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,610
I'm back.

285
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,450
Welcome back.

286
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,190
Welcome back.

287
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,900
Any developments in the missing
high school girl case?

288
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,880
It's all over the news.

289
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,380
Yeah, because her life's in danger.

290
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,580
The media started
receiving information today.

291
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,510
Just after 1 AM two days ago on the 4th,

292
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,910
after doing some shopping at a
convenience store, she got in a taxi.

293
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,750
Have they identified the taxi?

294
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,080
Apparently the clerk remembered the number.

295
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
Huh? After seeing it only once and briefly?

296
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,660
It happened to be their birthday, 1022.

297
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,390
What?

298
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,210
Wow.

299
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,030
A high school girl has gone missing
in Nerima City, Tokyo.

300
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,620
She has been unreachable
since she left her home late at night

301
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,080
two days ago on the 4th of this month.

302
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,730
The next morning, her family…

303
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,750
We, the Homosapiens, just received
the results of Round 1 of the N-1.

304
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,260
And would you believe it? We passed!

305
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,350
Of course we did.

306
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,050
Even amateurs could make it past Round 1.

307
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,890
Where do you think the finish line is?

308
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Equator Sauna

309
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,100
But last year, we failed in Round 2.

310
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,400
After ten years in the business...

311
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,560
Equator Sauna

312
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,570
Who is it?

313
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,870
We work for Ibusuki.

314
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,120
Hello.

315
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,280
Hello.

316
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,870
You look young. Have a seat.

317
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,100
Excuse us.

318
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,660
So?

319
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,950
We need a remote monitoring
dash cam and GPS installed.

320
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,810
What? Hold on. That's totally illegal.

321
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,510
Where?

322
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,740
His car. This is the dash cam.

323
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,640
It's a common model.

324
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,660
You'll install it, won't you?

325
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,020
If you pay for it.

326
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,730
You'll be paid tomorrow.

327
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,450
No can do. Equator operates 24 hours
a day, but that's just the sauna.

328
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,800
How long will it take?

329
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm busy. Give me three days.

330
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,840
Make it one.

331
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,330
1.5 days, or pay a rush late night surcharge.

332
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,940
How much?

333
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,410
550,000. And I'll need your help, too.

334
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,620
Pretty old car.
Didn't need all these tools.

335
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,040
How long will it take?

336
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,700
About seven or eight minutes.

337
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,080
Seven or eight minutes?

338
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,010
Yeah.

339
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,080
What is it?

340
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,140
Are you hungry?

341
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,740
Hold on.

342
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,490
Okay, all good.

343
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,810
That should do it.

344
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,970
Fine. I'll go buy you something.
Stay put and be good.

345
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,320
Crap, crap, crap.

346
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,020
Odokawa's coming, Odokawa's
coming, Odokawa's coming!

347
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,700
Crap, crap, crap!

348
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,160
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

349
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,200
Was he really talking to someone?

350
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,240
Yeah. He even ominously told them
to “stay put and be good.”

351
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,980
Anyway, I could imagine him kidnapping
and holding someone as cute as her

352
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,710
if she happened to get in his taxi.

353
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,940
He may be involved, but kidnapping
 and false imprisonment?

354
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,430
No, you're right. I guess not.

355
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,170
Did you call her cute?

356
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,670
Did I say that?

357
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,970
Yeah, didn't you just say that?

358
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,410
No, you definitely did.

359
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:13,860
What?

360
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,410
Her photo hasn't appeared on the news yet.

361
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,930
Why'd you say that?

362
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,780
I didn't say that.

363
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,910
No, you did.

364
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,430
What? Really?

365
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,180
Yeah.

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,270
I caught a glimpse of the boss' documents.

367
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,190
I knew it.

368
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,600
They were out in the open on his desk.

369
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,800
Hold on.

370
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,650
Hey.

371
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,550
Where'd they go?

372
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,940
Don't go through his stuff.

373
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,050
This is it.

374
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,250
Don't.

375
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,650
Wait, wait, wait.

376
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,470
Look at this Buddha.

377
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,000
Tada! A Buddha.

378
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,060
Wait a minute.

379
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,400
Mitsuya?

380
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,980
This is Yuki.

381
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Mitsuya-san.

382
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:15,300
Next Time

383
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,280
Have we met?

384
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,240
Why'd you end the investigation?

385
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,740
Rumor is he's done a lot of gray work.

386
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,830
He's probably never paid
for his mistakes before.

387
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,580
You should stay away from them.

388
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,900
You're cute, too, Rena-san.

389
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,900
This show is a work of fiction.

390
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,580
What?

391
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,870
I told you, I won't work for you.
