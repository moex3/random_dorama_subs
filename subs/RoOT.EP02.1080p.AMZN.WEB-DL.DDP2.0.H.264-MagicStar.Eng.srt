1
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,560
Wait. I nearly stepped on a frog.

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,760
Frogs are cute.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,520
I don't like their hands.
They're like maple leaves.

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,880
These are good.

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,050
The new summer flavor is pretty all right.

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,560
Senpai, did you know?

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,540
The syrup we eat is supposedly fake.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,760
What?

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,120
Doesn't that stuff come
from trees? Maples, right?

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
No. Apparently most of the stuff
they sell at the supermarket is fake.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,660
Huh.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,300
It's kind of sad that you can't be fooled
because you've had the real thing.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,050
Yeah, Yuki's family is rich.
They've had the real stuff.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,330
I bet you guys eat caviar
and steak all the time.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,660
We don't.

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,470
You take tons of classes, too, right?

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,620
Like dance and voice training.

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,080
Sounds rough. Plus, you
run track on top of that.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,820
Lucky. I bet you get to meet boys
from other schools when you take lessons.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,080
Seriously?

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,830
Not only that, but your dad
lives in Tokyo, right?

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,880
You're winning at life.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,870
You can sleep over all you want, too.

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,150
My mom's too strict for that.

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,720
Besides, I hardly ever see my dad.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,270
Let's all go to Tokyo together sometime.

27
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,270
That sounds nice.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,200
We can go look for real maple syrup,
get fancy ice cream,

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,330
and eat pancakes at a cafe.

30
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,890
Sounds nice.

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,120
In that case...

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,840
Let's go once Rena-san sets
a new personal record.

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,660
You're so disciplined, Yuki.

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,940
It'll be a reward.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,020
How can I learn to jump like you?

36
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,260
It's easy. Boing!

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,290
Like a frog?

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,230
Hey, quit it! I nearly
stepped on one earlier!

39
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,180
Yeah. Just wait. I'll contact you.

40
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm really sorry about today. Bye!

41
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,200
Sorry. I know you're busy.

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,080
It's fine.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
Was that your boyfriend?

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,740
No, a customer.

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,590
He's a big spender, but he
doesn't know when to shut up.

46
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,170
He's probably trying
to entertain me, but still.

47
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,260
I always feel like it would've been better
if he'd kept his mouth shut, y'know?

48
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,850
Just now, he said he'd blow up
my phone if I didn't respond.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm glad you haven't changed, Kanon.

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,270
I know it's my job,
but it's a pain in the butt.

51
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,970
So, what'd you want to discuss?

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,310
Remember Mitsuya Yuki from
our high school track team?

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,740
Oh, yeah. Mitsuya Yuki. Is that right?

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
What?

55
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,440
Oh, that Yuki!

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
Yeah. I can't believe you forgot.

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,430
I didn't forget!

58
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,340
I've just been busy with my own
 stuff since coming to Tokyo.

59
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,620
I don't have time to worry about people
who aren't a threat to my existence.

60
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,020
Thank you.

61
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,370

Okay, here we go. Say cheese.

You still have time!

76
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,360
We're never going to
be popular, Ichimura-san.

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,600
As long as we're wearing masks,
we won't get fans like Nikaido-san.

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,840
I wouldn't get fans
even if I removed mine.

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,340
You desperately need more
self-esteem, Ichimura-san.

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,530
I used to perform unmasked,
and this is where I ended up.

81
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,580
If anything, it'd be crazy
if I had any self-esteem.

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,780
Wow. I've never experienced
anything like this.

83
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,220
It's not that different
from the nightlife business.

84
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,120
Can we go talk to them?

85
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,220
Can I help you?

86
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,690
Um, we're huge fans of Mystery Kiss.

87
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,620
Yes, that's right.

88
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,200
Really?

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, yes.

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm so glad. We don't
have many female fans.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,600
They say people who make it
are loved by men and women alike.

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,140
Yeah.

93
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,790
Um, Mitsuya-san?

94
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,550
Yes?

95
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,850
You're my favorite, Mitsuya-san.

96
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,630
Seriously?

97
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,030
Yes. I love you.

98
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,570
Really? Thanks!

99
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,860
What do you like about me?

100
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:34,420
Your dancing, of course, but you've
got this brilliant aura about you.

101
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,590
No one's ever told me that before.

102
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,330
She can sense all that when
you're wearing a mask? Crazy.

103
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,220
Right?

104
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,000
But don't you think I'd be
more popular than those two?

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,460
What?

106
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,350
Mystery.

107
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,350
Mystery.

108
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
Oh, Mitsuya-san.

109
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,330
Yes?

110
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,870
You don't remember me?

111
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm sorry. Have we met?

112
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm sorry, but today's event
is ending soon.

113
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,280
Oh, okay.

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,990
Let's go, Rena. I hope
we meet again someday. Bye!

115
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,310
We'll be waiting.

116
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,310
Thank you.

117
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,630
Thank you.

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
Even girls like them can become idols, huh?

119
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,630
Didn't seem like they're
very popular, though.

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Apparently they get a fair bit of attention.

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,290
So, what was up with that Mitsuya Yuki?
Was she an impostor?

122
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,920
Or a stranger with the same name.

123
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,080
With the same age and name?

124
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah.

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,640
Huh. I think it's just a stage name.

126
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,840
She'd tell more people about it
if she became an idol.

127
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,810
Besides, she never seemed like
the type to go into the business.

128
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,200
Thanks, Kanon. I appreciate it.

129
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,530
It's fine. The only thing more important to me
than work is a request from you, Rena.

130
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,690
You should just work at my place.
You'd make good money.

131
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,290
Bye.

132
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,130
Sorry. Thanks for waiting.

133
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,700
Thank you.

134
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,560
Thank you.

135
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,850
Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,540
Because I knew this would happen.

137
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,180
I never imagined she was
your junior from high school.

138
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,020
Either way, all the more reason
for you to stay out of this.

139
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,650
Why won't you let me work an important
 case after all the work I've done?

140
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,560
C'mon, you two. Cut it out.

141
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,100
I'm not doing this job to look
after that hopeless newbie.

142
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,640
See you later.

143
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,140
See you.

144
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Have you kept up your
 investigation of Odokawa?

145
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,290
Yes.

146
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,960
I tried questioning his neighbors, but
no one would talk to me. I got nothing.

147
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,500
Plus, most of these homes
are empty. Nobody lives there.

148
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,110
I guess you're right.

149
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:04,160
Besides that, he hasn't done anything
unusual. He's back to his ordinary life.

150
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,520
He mostly operates along set routes.

151
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,300
Oh, right.

152
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,940
He follows these trend-chasing
routes through downtown areas

153
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,740
and in front of TV stations.

154
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,550
Oh, right. Rena-san, how was your junior?

155
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,290
It was someone else.

156
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,430
Well, yeah. If the missing person were
a famous idol, it'd be a bigger story.

157
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,100
But you were so pissy with
 the boss. You scared me.

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
Did you get confused
because she's wearing a mask?

159
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Mitsuya Yuki

160
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,570
Anyway, masked idols sure is a novel concept.

161
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,870
Oh, she's cute.

162
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,400
This center girl's cute.

163
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,260
Let's see. Nikaido Rui, huh?

164
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,130
Oh, shit. I get why those nerds
obsess over them. She's really cute.

165
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,630
Don't forget, someone's gone missing.

166
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,840
Wait, wait, wait.

167
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,250
You're cute, too, Rena-san.

168
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,390
What?

169
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,520
No, that's not right. That was rude of me.

170
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,960
How should I put it?

171
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,740
You're in no way inferior to them.

172
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,540
What is it?

173
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,880
What? No, wait. Personally,
you're exactly my...

174
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,320
Where are you going?

175
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,240
To gather information.
You're coming with me.

176
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,470
I am?

177
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,090
Yes, on Odokawa.

178
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,670
Oh, right! Odokawa. Right.

179
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,480
See you later.

180
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,740
We'll be back!

181
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,400
Also, could you stop sexually harassing me?

182
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,260
Yes?

183
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,490
Ow! Not the jewels!

184
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, I remember him.

185
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,040
We used to note down passengers'
traits. I saw his notes once.

186
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,170
There was some kind of shareholder meeting,
and we had to handle a ton of passengers.

187
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,690
His report that day just said
monkey, monkey, monkey.

188
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,410
Monkey?

189
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,970
Might've been a gibbon in there, too.

190
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,710
A gibbon?

191
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,320
I know humans and monkeys are similar,
but it gave me the creeps.

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,150
It is creepy. Maybe he was
 under a lot of stress?

193
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,410
More like he's always been odd.

194
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,590
He can't recognize people's faces
or something. He's crazy.

195
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,600
But he did his job properly?

196
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,980
I guess. Rumor is he's done
a lot of gray work.

197
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,330
What kind of work?

198
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,580
Y'know, gray work. Don't tell anyone I told you.

199
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,270
Her?

200
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,070
Yeah.

201
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,390
Excuse me. May we speak with you?

202
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm not selling. Shoo, shoo!

203
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,610
I don't know what's going on these days.

204
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,940
Weird people have been hanging around.

205
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,150
Around where?

206
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,480
There, in that building. The blue one.

207
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,510
Harada Building 3, I think.

208
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,210
Excuse me.

209
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,390
Wait, wait, wait.

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,230
It's okay.

211
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,030
We have a few questions.
Could we have a moment of your time?

212
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,320
We're researching neighborhood
connections at the college.

213
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,820
We're asking people for their stories
and about the local history.

214
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,100
You're that guy Dobu beat up.

215
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,690
Dobu? You saw that?

216
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,500
Then why didn't you help me?

217
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,510
You should stay away from them.

218
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,120
So, what'd you want to know?

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,450
We heard there's a strange
taxi driver who lives in the area.

220
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,360
Oh, him? Come to think of it,
the other day...

221
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,250
If you want the rest,
it'll cost you at least a hundred yen.

222
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,650
Seriously? You're so greedy.

223
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,030
Here.

224
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,380
The day you were beat up,

225
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,070
I saw a girl getting out of that taxi
driver's car in the middle of the night.

226
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,060
She was real pretty. She was
hiding her face, but I could tell.

227
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,810
I've got good eyes.

228
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,530
Oh. I got a picture of her.

229
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,390
What? Why didn't you say so?

230
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,460
I definitely did! You just weren't listening.

231
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,380
Huh? I'm not sure
there was a taxi, though.

232
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,590
Was this her?

233
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,320
After that, the girl...

234
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,490
She never came out of that building.

235
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,010
Was there anything else unusual?

236
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,970
Normally, nobody goes in or out
of that building at night.

237
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,370
Where's the data?

238
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,430
With Dobu. The pictures are
on the computer that Dobu guy took.

239
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,300
Also, sometimes there's
a huge car parked out front.

240
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,380
Definitely not an honest citizen's car.

241
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,920
Thank you.

242
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,730
Thank you.

243
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,700
Hey, you.

244
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,030
This is one of those things
that are popular now, right?

245
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,080
Some kind of paperweight or yokan.

246
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,110
There's gold in these, right?
Do they sell for a lot?

247
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,960
Ugh, where did you find that?

248
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,070
Wait, where did you find that?

249
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,880
We're with Ibusuki.
We'd like you to restore some data.

250
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,290
Leave it in that drawer.

251
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,680
Depending on the contents,
it could cost you.

252
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,230
Taeko-san, you've got a keen nose.

253
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,310
This taxi driver might be holding
a high school girl captive.

254
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,460
Taeko-san, what do you think?

255
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,490
Would Odokawa-san do something like that?

256
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,990
This isn't what I had in mind
when I asked you to investigate him.

257
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,960
Neither did we when we took the job.

258
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,010
We haven't found conclusive evidence yet.

259
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,590
But he's been in touch with a police officer.

260
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,550
It's possible Odokawa-san
is caught up in the case somehow.

261
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,280
Is there anything else you know?

262
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,180
He said he doesn't wash clothes
that don't directly touch his skin.

263
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,960
In any case, we know Odokawa-san
is an eccentric man.

264
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,240
We'll put together a report on that,
so give us some more time.

265
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,440
Also, Taeko-san, I've been wondering.

266
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,210
Odokawa-san's taxi may have been
parked outside a certain building

267
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,870
the day the girl went missing.

268
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,730
Harada Building 3.

269
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,800
Oh, my.

270
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,990
Does that ring any bells?

271
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,020
It's been about 15 years.

272
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:25,380
A few major businesses tried to redevelop
the neighborhood. The fighting was intense.

273
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,930
The land sharks came to my place, too.

274
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,870
One of their subsidiary fronts moved in.

275
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,580
They ended up taking
over the whole building.

276
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,050
So this is Harada Building 3.

277
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:56,710
Harada Building 3

278
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,520
A cram school, an English school,
a dance school, a yoga studio,

279
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,710
and even a capoeira school. What a mess.

280
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,710
Does this place have anything
to do with Odokawa?

281
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,680
What kind of high school girl
takes a taxi to cram school?

282
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,750
You're right.

283
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,080
What's Gray Dog?

284
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,880
Gray Dog, Inc.

285
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,130
It's a talent agency.

286
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,420
A talent agency?

287
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,660
What do you want? I told you,
I won't work for you.

288
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,230
Odokawa-kun, let's go for a drive.

289
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,230
Sure thing. You'll pay
your fare, won't you?

290
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,140
Good to see you again, Dobu-san.

291
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,910
Yano. I see you've still got
a crowd of groupies.

292
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,960
How am I supposed to get in?

293
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,020
Unlike someone I know,
my popularity has grown.

294
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,670
The only thing that's grown to make up for
your lack of substance is your shamelessness.

295
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,520
Hey, you two! Cut it out.

296
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,480
So, what happened with Odokawa?

297
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,110
I paid him a visit, but I'm
not satisfied with the results.

298
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,370
No leads?

299
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,890
I even reached out to
the police, but nothing yet.

300
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:25,280
More importantly, isn't the bigger problem
that Yano might be involved?

301
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,560
How long has it been?

302
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,420
About 20 minutes.

303
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,670
Since you got out of prison.

304
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,230
The tenth anniversary of my uncle's death
was the other day, so five or six years.

305
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:50,990
Don't you think it's time you got
used to the way the world is now?

306
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,940
We don't use this anymore.

307
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,580
We use this now.

308
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,750
I'm not changing my ways.

309
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,080
You're too old.

310
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,880
You can't be a lone wolf forever.

311
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,880
My underlings are at your disposal, you know.

312
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,640
Forget about me, boss. How's your health?

313
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,350
I'm doing better.
Maybe it's thanks to the sauna.

314
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:33,250
I'm scared of change, which is why I'm
thinking of leaving things up to you boys.

315
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,450
I have an announcement to make.

316
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,290
I, Taichi Kabasawa, will capture
Dobu by the end of the year!

317
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,700
For those of you who don't know who Dobu is,

318
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,650
I'm not sure if he's a thug or yakuza member,
but the police are after him.

319
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,180
As a matter of fact, I know people
who were beaten half to death by Dobu.

320
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,640
I'll put off finding a job
and my schoolwork to catch him!

321
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,950
What will I do once I catch him?

322
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,000
He'll apologize. I'll make him apologize.

323
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,000
Apologize?

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,340
I'll upload a video of him
on his knees. I'll rehabilitate him.

325
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,180
Nice.

326
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,250
If the law can't punish him, then I will!

327
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,190
Yeah!

328
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,410
No, we will. Including you,
person watching this video.

329
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,180
Together, we'll catch Dobu!

330
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,220
How did this boring crap go viral?

331
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,030
I'm Meisei University
student Taichi Kabasawa!

332
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,830
What? Don't you think it's amazing?

333
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,100
He said he'd catch Dobu.

334
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,250
I won't run. I won't hide.
I'll stand in the line of fire.

335
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,930
He's probably never paid
for his mistakes before.

336
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,930
So I'm accepting any
and all information. Help me.

337
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,900
See you later.

338
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,390
Crimes must be punished.
Together we shall defeat evil!

339
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,830
Is this Dobu-san really that famous?

340
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,020
Thank you.

341
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,830
Justice will win!

342
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,630
Apparently he's committed
every evil act under the sun.

343
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,860
Thank you very much.

344
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,250
I had no idea someone so dangerous
picked a fight with me.

345
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,660
Should you be bragging about that?

346
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,810
What was a big shot like him doing
wandering around there, anyway?

347
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,800
You mean Dobu?

348
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,480
Yeah. And send me the link
to Kabasawa's video.

349
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm going to make an appointment.

350
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,290
What? An appointment?

351
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,890
I wouldn't meet with someone like him.

352
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,720
Hey. I heard you guys
have been visiting Sekido.

353
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,270
I never approved that.

354
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,120
Sorry.

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,040
I told you so.

356
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,600
Finding the high school girl is my job.

357
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,080
Your job is running a background
check on that taxi driver.

358
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,960
Private eyes don't find fault
with or judge people.

359
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,380
There's no need for us
to put ourselves in danger.

360
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,890
Danger? What do you mean, danger?

361
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,410
What happened to Mitsuya-san—
to Yuki after that?

362
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,620
They canceled the investigation.
Apparently, they heard from her.

363
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:34,020
So I want you to leave this
Mitsuya Yuki business alone. Got it?

364
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,320
Ow! That totally opened my cut.

365
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,450
Is that thing your favorite?

366
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,310
Huh?

367
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,040
You're always touching it.

368
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,540
Do I? I never noticed.

369
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,380
It's cute.

370
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,570
No way.

371
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,820
That's the first time
anyone's called it cute.

372
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,020
I put something ugly on it
so no one would steal it.

373
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,860
But maybe I've grown attached to it.

374
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,840
Then could I have that keychain
when you graduate?

375
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,420
But you've already got everything, Yuki.

376
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
What else was I supposed to do?

377
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,960
But why'd you end the investigation?

378
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,390
Because he said he heard from her.

379
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,020
We can't trust anything that manager says.

380
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,840
She would've told us
if she wanted to move out.

381
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,150
Maybe she heard about your past.

382
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,820
You really think so?

383
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,930
At least once, every man should go home
and earnestly face his wife and kids.

384
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,860
It's not like he brings home the bacon.

385
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,100
Feet.

386
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,550
Hey.

387
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,220
Hey, wait! You need to be careful with that.

388
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,840
That thing? What is that?

389
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,730
Yeah.

390
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,680
What is that creepy thing
that emits uniquely evil vibes?

391
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,470
How could you?

392
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,960
You're the one who bought that weird
keychain from a homeless person.

393
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,950
What? Are you saying that's not weird?

394
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,910
It's my lucky treasure boat eraser.

395
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,470
My dad bought it for me in grade school
when he went to China.

396
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,820
Sounds fishy to me.

397
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,110
Rare things started coming my way
since I acquired it.

398
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,160
Like what?

399
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,980
Like a La Sagrada Familia eraser
and a Leaning Tower of Pisa eraser.

400
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,480
Just erasers?

401
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,610
At the time, collecting erasers
was all the rage.

402
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,080
We were really competitive about it.

403
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,490
I looked for an eraser rarer
than my friend's dodo eraser.

404
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,040
What was it?

405
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,630
The world's only Donraku eraser.

406
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,860
Donraku?

407
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,010
I talked to my dad
and bid on an online auction.

408
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,200
We went back and forth for a while,
until suddenly they bid 100,000 yen.

409
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,510
That's when I dropped out.

410
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,110
Kids are bidding 100,000 yen on erasers?
What's the world coming to?

411
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,310
Seriously. I'm glad I didn't buy it.

412
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,060
Wow, you got a 50-50 right for once.

413
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,530
It's not like I always choose wrong.

414
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,950
You don't know that.

415
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,360
There's no way to know at the time
if you're making the right choice or not.

416
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,510
True. In that case, every wrong
choice I've made until now

417
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,750
could turn into successes by the time I die.

418
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,230
Optimistic, aren't you?

419
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,160
Was Donraku that much of a celebrity?

420
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,630
He was handsome when he was younger.
Had a wild side, though.

421
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,340
You're too young to know, huh?

422
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,960
Yup.

423
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,550
I watched his show every week.

424
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,250
Same.

425
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,550
I laughed so hard it made my stomach hurt.

426
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,680
These days it's like a talk show
with a prominent rakugo storyteller.

427
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,990
My mom got really mad at me.

428
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,580
She said, "Why's my ugly idiot
son watching this low-brow crap?"

429
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,620
Ugly idiot? You're kidding, right?

430
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,650
Excuse me, Donraku-san.

431
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:16,830
Next Time

432
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,650
Turns out he was just an ordinary old man.

433
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,650
Love is...

434
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,110
Did something happen to you?

435
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,780
We all have high hopes for you,
Kabasawa-sama.

436
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,710
What is it, driver?

437
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,160
I feel like I've seen her before.

438
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,980
This show is a work of fiction.

439
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,410
And if I say no?

440
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,960
I'll kill you.
