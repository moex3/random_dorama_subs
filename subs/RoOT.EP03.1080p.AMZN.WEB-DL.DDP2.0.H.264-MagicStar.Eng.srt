Soon we'll be announcing
the winning numbers.

We're all looking forward
to the end of the year.

9
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,830
It doesn't feel real, does it?

10
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,170
But somebody is going to win all of this.

11
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,570
I keep thinking, "What if I win?"

12
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,190
I'd like to add a sauna to my bathroom.

13
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,540
What about you, sir?

14
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,310
If we're giving it to him, we should
offer that N-1 prize money instead.

15
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,240
Why's everyone so desperate for money?

Is it really that important? How disgraceful.

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,140
There are more important things in life.

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,320
Hey, you watching TV. Yeah, you.

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,360
Make sure you're filming me, cameraman.

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,690
That's right. You right there.

23
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,830
First, hug the people next to you. Love them.

24
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,410
You shouldn't be wasting your time
watching dumb crap like this.

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,870
I'm telling you idiots to look
at the people right next to you.

Next up, the weather. Sakurai-san, save us.

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,430
I'll go get the car.

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,440
Sure.

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,070
Excuse me, Donraku-san.

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,480
Thanks for looking out for Yuki.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,120
Of course. I'm just worried
about where she is.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,230
I'm worried, too.

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm actually a private eye.

36
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,110
What?

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,460
You hired my boss Ibusuki, didn't you?

38
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,050
No, I asked an old acquaintance for help.

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,880
We can't seem to get rid
of each other, y'know?

40
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,320
Maybe it reached your agency through him.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,220
I see.

42
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,110
Did you receive any threatening
phone calls or ransom demands?

43
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,050
I already told the police this,
but no, nothing like that.

44
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,240
At first, I thought that might be it, too.

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,530
Maybe someone found out
that she's my daughter.

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,260
I've got a lot of enemies, you see.

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm sure there are people
who hate me all over.

48
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,990
So, what about Yuki?

49
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,180
Apparently she ran away from home
and said not to look for her.

50
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,680
Then my wife canceled the search.

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm not convinced, though.

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,150
I won't believe it until I see her face.

53
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,070
Is that how kids are these days?

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,270
I don't think Yuki's that kind of girl.

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,230
Another celebrity was caught cheating.
What do you think, sir?

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,610
You know what I think? Who cares?

57
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,000
You'd better not be slacking off again.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,020
Sorry.

59
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,960
Another bill for you.

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,960
Thanks.

61
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,620
I sure did everything I could
for my first job.

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,000
It made me realize everyone's got a history.
A life. Even ordinary taxi drivers.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,330
What do we do with this information?

64
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,530
What about the illegal stuff?
Should we retrieve it?

65
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,010
Odokawa could be involved
in a criminal case.

66
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,660
We can't leave things the way they are.

67
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,080
We already looked into that.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,550
He was just a regular middle-aged guy.

69
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,760
Besides, he drives dozens
of passengers a day.

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
It's not that odd if one of them
went missing.

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,770
That one passenger was
my junior in high school,

72
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,200
and she might've gotten
mixed up in something.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, I don't know your high school junior.

74
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,030
Oh, yeah?

75
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,280
At this agency, you're my junior.

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,930
Guess I shouldn't care about you, either.

77
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,520
You can do the rest of this yourself.

78
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,870
Ibu, one of your young 'uns
went to see Don-chan.

79
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,020
I told her not to.

80
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,480
You didn't put her up to it?

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,080
The girl's her junior from back home.

82
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,360
Once she gets into something,
she acts indiscriminately.

83
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah?

84
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,200
That's no good.

85
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,800
Please just leave her alone.

86
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,950
If anything happens to her,
then I'll be forced to act.

87
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,850
Why hasn't the girl been found yet, anyway?

88
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,160
Doesn't make sense.

89
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,600
This shouldn't be that difficult.

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Well...

91
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,800
So, actually...

92
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,360
After aggressively haggling over his fare,

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,570
that chatty passenger said he was
going to buy lottery tickets

94
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,700
so he could buy up some idol group's CDs.

95
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,790
I made up a random number on the spot,

96
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,770
and he rushed right over to buy a ticket.

97
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,350
I was like, "Seriously? You still had money?"

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,040
Hey, are you listening?

99
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,410
Love is both a painful and beautiful thing.

100
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,950
Dude, don't. Did something happen to you?

101
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,720
She's just a little girl.

102
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
She's still only 18.

103
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,270
So far we've only exchanged messages,
but we get along great.

104
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,270
We're supposed to meet up soon.

105
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,400
But she's too busy to meet, right?

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,650
I know what you're trying to say.

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,650
You think she doesn't exist, don't you?

108
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,160
She's really real.

109
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,950
Kakihana-san!!
Good luck at work

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,950
Are you sure you're not being tricked?

111
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,690
Here you are.

112
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,880
Are you jealous?

113
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,930
Of course not.

114
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,930
Think about it. You said so yourself.

115
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,470
There's no demand for us
in the marriage marketplace.

116
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,730
I'm telling you, it's the feeling—

117
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,270
You've never even met her.
How can there be any feeling?

118
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,890
Look.

119
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,870
Let me see your profile.

120
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,170
No.

121
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,840
Give it.

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,420
Quit it.

123
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,030
Give it.

124
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,110
That's my personal information.

125
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,110
Give it.

126
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,700
Kakihana Eiji
Occupation: IT Worker
Annual Income: 20,000,000 yen
Education: College

127
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,080
These specs you lied about
way outshine any kind of feeling.

128
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,700
I know.

129
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,540
But still, I wanna dream.

130
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,680
Ibusuki?

131
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,700
The guy who used to help us out
runs a detective agency now.

132
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,190
Come to think of it, some youngster
was sniffing around your territory.

133
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,420
Was he one of Ibusuki's guys?

134
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,390
Dunno, but I gave him a beating.

135
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,050
I'm telling you, you've gotta
learn to use your head.

136
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,630
If this is true, I'll have
to offer compensation.

137
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,650
Don-chan will be dragged into this, too.

138
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,220
What do you say, Dobu?
Could you clean up my mess again?

139
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm begging you.

140
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,660
You want me to protect Yano?

141
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,200
Not protect him.

142
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,050
I'm asking you to let me settle this.

143
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,870
I'm doing this for your sake, too.

144
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,860
Kabasawa-sama?

145
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,800
Hey. Rena-chan?

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Yes.

147
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,980
Wow.

148
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,600
I bought this car and condo, too.

149
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,970
But now that I have them,
I'm kind of disappointed.

150
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,460
Maybe I spent too much.

151
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,500
No way. You're trying to make
the world a better place.

152
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,480
You deserve this level of luxury.

153
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,350
Thank you for waiting.

154
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,130
Oh, I can't drink.

155
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,630
You're 19, right?

156
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,280
Yeah.

157
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,020
Oh, right. Right, of course.

158
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,270
I'm supposed to be a model citizen.
I shouldn't be acting like this.

159
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,190
Since the police are no help at all, we all
have high hopes for you, Kabasawa-sama.

160
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,740
You can count on me.

161
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,530
That's why I'm hoping
you'll get my laptop back.

162
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,820
I've got lots of important data saved on it.

163
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,700
Where does Dobu normally hang out?

164
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,130
Apparently you picked up
the missing high school girl from Nerima.

165
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,570
I handed over my dash cam data
to the police a while ago.

166
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,040
I have a request.

167
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,470
What's that?

168
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,080
I need you to keep your mouth shut.

169
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,570
Daimon already told me
to keep my mouth shut.

170
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,880
Not just the police. Don't tell anybody.

171
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,930
Don't tell anybody? Like who?

172
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,200
Everybody.

173
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,820
Tell 'em you lost your dash cam data.

174
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,480
So, what do you want help with?

175
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,310
If anyone shows up looking
for your dash cam data,

176
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,860
I want you to let me know.

177
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,320
And if I refuse?

178
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,490
I'll kill you.

179
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,930
Let me handle the laptop.

180
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,350
I promise I'll get it back once I catch Dobu.

181
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,420
Anyway, what do you want to do after this?

182
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,140
Wanna come to my place?

183
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,890
You piece of shit.

184
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,600
Huh? What was that?

185
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,430
I don't know...

186
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,600
Sometimes I want to be spoiled by
someone who sees me as Kabasawa Taichi.

187
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,790
Everyone calls me a hero, but
men who fight need breaks, too.

188
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,220
Today let's forget about everything
and have fun, Rena-chan.

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,620
So, when do you think you'll take down Dobu?

190
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,980
I said let's forget about Dobu today.

191
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,590
Hurry up and become a real hero.

192
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,240
Did you know you're
getting more haters recently?

193
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,820
"Kabasawa isn't a hero.
He's just desperate for recognition."

194
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,210
"He's scared of Dobu. Just a one-hit wonder."

195
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,470
"He's sleeping with his female followers."

196
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,280
Wait, that last one might be true.

197
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,390
I was frustrated that I couldn't
tell them they're wrong.

198
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,790
But after seeing how
you've been acting recently...

199
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,150
Shut up.

200
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,030
What?

201
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,410
You don't know anything about me.

202
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,430
I stirred up a sensation
and put myself in harm's way.

203
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,390
I didn't ask to be deified, okay?

204
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,630
You don't know what the pressure is like.

205
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,050
It's terrifying.

206
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,260
Don't project your fantasies onto me.

207
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,000
You got to dream, too, didn't you?

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,590
Who do you have to thank for that, huh?

209
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,890
Crap.

210
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,810
Hello, Rena-san?

211
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,790
Where are you?

212
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,090
And what happened to Taeko-san's
report? It's weirdly dry.

213
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,290
What have you been doing with Kabasawa?

214
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,350
Are you slacking off again?

215
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,220
Dobu was in Odokawa's car.

216
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,990
What? Why?

217
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,150
Not only that, but Dobu demanded Odokawa's
cooperation and threatened to kill him.

218
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,580
Wait, wait. The dash cam caught all of that?

219
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,690
We should call the police.

220
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,970
What are we going to tell the police?

221
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,390
We're filming him without his knowledge.

222
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,840
Hold on. Did you use my computer
without my permission?

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,970
But you left it open.

224
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,410
I hope Dobu hits you again.

225
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,370
Gimme a break, here!

226
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,000
Anyway, I'm going to follow Dobu.

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,840
What?

228
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm going to get my data back
and solve this mystery.

229
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,250
With my photos, we might be able to
find your high school junior.

230
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,420
We'll be able to give the banker's
wife her evidence, too!

231
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,650
How?

232
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,920
I'll steal my laptop
back while he's sleeping.

233
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,100
Are you stupid?

234
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,020
There's no way you'll make it out
unscathed if you go alone.

235
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,770
You told me to handle it myself, though.

236
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,020
That's not what I meant!

237
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,360
Because of you, I'm eating
yakiniku by myself.

238
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,880
Why are you having yakiniku?

239
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,730
Because I'm in the middle of following him.

240
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,930
Please don't make any decisions by yourself.

241
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,150
Don't try to solve anything, either.

242
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,340
Limit yourself to just watching him.

243
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,420
Got it. But you know, I had
more than two choices this time.

244
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,750
I chose from out of at least ten. Bye!

245
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,830
Ten...? Hey, wait!

246
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,960
I've snuck into Dobu's hideout!

247
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,010
Ow, ow, ow!

248
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,090
Let go!

249
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,060
Ow, ow, ow!

250
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,630
Mercy! I'm sorry!

251
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,270
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

252
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,330
What?

253
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:25,950
Listen, my boss is trying to
construct a building here.

254
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,930
I know all his henchmen.

255
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,420
Naturally, all the construction
workers are his guys, too.

256
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,480
You know what that means, don't you?

257
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,500
Um, there's joy in creating
something with your friends?

258
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,090
Ow, ow, ow!

259
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,640
I don't know.

260
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,000
You need to be direct with me. I'm not
good at reading between the lines.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Scream all you want.
No one's coming to help you.

262
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,740
I've got the solvents I need to
 dissolve your corpse right here.

263
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,280
If I bury you, they'll never find anything.

264
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,710
No, wait. I've only lived 24 years.

265
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,770
You think your life's just
getting started, huh?

266
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,510
I do. I finally got a job recently.

267
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,710
It's boring right now, but
I'm hoping things will pick up.

268
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,400
So for now, I'm being patient
and working really hard.

269
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,520
Why did you follow me?

270
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,050
It was a coincidence.

271
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,940
Who put you up to it?

272
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,690
This happens to me all the time.

273
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,430
I run into my teachers from school
when I go traveling.

274
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,920
Really. I'm serious.

275
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,840
Uh-huh. I've got one question for you.

276
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,810
Okay.

277
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,160
It's a simple, two-choice question.

278
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,620
Two choices...

279
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:06,170
Do you prefer your right finger
or your left finger?

280
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,010
But I've got ten.

281
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,120
I can't answer the phone right now—

282
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,520
I can't answer the phone right now.
Please call again later.

283
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,950
I see. A background check on Odokawa, huh?

284
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,460
Then you should be following him.

285
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:35,100
I happened to see you while watching him
and wondered how you were doing.

286
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,810
Terribly, obviously.

287
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,890
Right.

288
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,150
Hold on. What do you mean, you saw me?

289
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,020
Well, uh...

290
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,590
Oh, the camera. It's the camera
in Odokawa's car, isn't it?

291
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,900
It's called a dash cam.

292
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,730
I don't give a shit.

293
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,940
So, how come you can see what's on that?

294
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,540
Ow, ow, ow!

295
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,360
Don't invoke your duty of
 confidentiality when it suits you.

296
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,230
Are you working with Odokawa, too?

297
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,880
What do you mean, working with him?!

298
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,290
Aren't you working with him?!

299
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,610
All right, fine. Then you're
gonna help me, too.

300
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,740
What?

301
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,210
What is this?

302
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,420
Anything but that, please!

303
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,130
She's your girl, huh?

304
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:37,570
Oh, well... I'm not sure
what she thinks, but...

305
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,220
Personally, I don't think
it's out of the question...

306
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,670
She's not gonna go to the cops
if she doesn't hear from you,

307
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,690
and you don't have a GPS up your ass, right?

308
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,130
Nope, she doesn't care
about me at all. Sadly.

309
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,450
And yet, her name's in your
contacts without honorifics.

310
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,650
Yes.

311
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,790
I'm going to tell you everything
I know about Odokawa.

312
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,600
I've already investigated that thoroughly.

313
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,910
What?

314
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,250
I already know plenty.

315
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,940
What?

316
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,660
Ow!

317
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,200
What do you want help with?

318
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,170
What is it, Driver?

319
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,340
I feel like I've seen her before.

320
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,150
Whatever. Let's get moving.

321
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,110
She keeps her face hidden.

322
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,990
If you recognize her face, you must've
come to her concert before she debuted.

323
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,500
Is she a singer or something?

324
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,920
That's not it, then.
I've never been to a concert.

325
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,680
Are you okay? Are you tired?

326
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,180
Is Nikaido-san coming?

327
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,580
Later.

328
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,120
Did she do something?

329
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,380
I can't keep up with her ambition.

330
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,030
You can work at your own pace, Ichimura.

331
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,410
She's incredible. I bet she'd
kill someone just to get ahead.

332
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,390
She probably already has, honestly.

333
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,980
What are you talking about?

334
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,040
Maybe I'm not suited to this job.

335
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,700
Mitsuya's already inside.

336
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,970
I don't like her.
I liked things better before.

337
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,740
What are you looking at?

338
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,380
Head towards the Kamimeguro
intersection next.

339
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,790
There's a building nearby.

340
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,680
Kamimeguro?

341
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,010
Yeah.

342
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,070
I was just thinking about how I once drove
a girl around that other girl's age there.

343
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,940
What? When?

344
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,290
About two weeks ago, I think.
She must've been from your agency.

345
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm surprised you remember,
but it must've been someone else.

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,280
She was a young girl taking a pretty
long trip in the middle of the night.

347
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,530
Not only that, but she
called herself an idol.

348
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,890
Are you sure it wasn't
the girl we just dropped off?

349
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,740
But she's a calico cat.

350
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,570
What does that mean?

351
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,850
You're sure you dropped off
that girl at this office?

352
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,640
Yeah.

353
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,320
Listen, Driver.

354
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,970
Does this car have a recording device?

355
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,340
Why?

356
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,720
Sometimes you see them in the news.

357
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,040
You know, in stories about robberies.

358
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,810
Yeah, I've got one.

359
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,560
Any chance I could get your data?

360
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,000
What? You finally picked up.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,080
Where'd you wander off to?
You weren't answering your phone.

362
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,470
Sorry.

363
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,070
The boss is hiding something.

364
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,350
He was with some shady people yesterday.

365
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,350
I see.

366
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,940
You're awfully low-energy today.

367
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,970
I'm at the hospital right now.

368
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,560
What? Why? Did Dobu do something to you?

369
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, no. Actually, I lost him
while I was tailing him.

370
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,880
Then why?

371
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,140
I fell down the stairs and broke my pinkie.

372
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,120
Liar.

373
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,210
I might've found the taxi
Mitsuya took that day.

374
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,640
And?

375
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,140
Apparently the driver remembers her.

376
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,880
What should we do?

377
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,530
Where is Yuki now?

378
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:16,720
Next Time

379
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,190
Do you think Donraku-san
is hiding something?

380
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,100
We're partners, Rena. Buddies!

381
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,450
Something definitely happened to you.

382
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,280
You tell me the truth, got it?

383
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,580
This is where they practice.

384
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,470
Shiho-chan, do you actually
want to get married?

385
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,860
This show is a work of fiction.
