Soon we'll be announcing
the winning numbers.

We're all looking forward
to the end of the year.

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,830
It doesn't feel real, does it?

10
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,170
But somebody is going to win all of this.

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,570
I keep thinking, "What if I win?"

12
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,190
I'd like to add a sauna to my bathroom.

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,540
What about you, sir?

14
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,310
If we're giving it to him, we should
offer that N-1 prize money instead.

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,240
Why's everyone so desperate for money?

Is it really that important? How disgraceful.

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,140
There are more important things in life.

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,320
Hey, you watching TV. Yeah, you.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,360
Make sure you're filming me, cameraman.

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,690
That's right. You right there.

23
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,830
First, hug the people next to you. Love them.

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,410
You shouldn't be wasting your time
watching dumb crap like this.

25
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm telling you idiots to look
at the people right next to you.

Next up, the weather. Sakurai-san, save us.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,430
I'll go get the car.

30
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,440
Sure.

31
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,070
Excuse me, Donraku-san.

32
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,480
Thanks for looking out for Yuki.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,120
Of course. I'm just worried
about where she is.

34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,230
I'm worried, too.

35
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,230
I'm actually a private eye.

36
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,110
What?

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,460
You hired my boss Ibusuki, didn't you?

38
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,050
No, I asked an old acquaintance for help.

39
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,880
We can't seem to get rid
of each other, y'know?

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,320
Maybe it reached your agency through him.

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,220
I see.

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,110
Did you receive any threatening
phone calls or ransom demands?

43
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,050
I already told the police this,
but no, nothing like that.

44
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,240
At first, I thought that might be it, too.

45
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,530
Maybe someone found out
that she's my daughter.

46
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,260
I've got a lot of enemies, you see.

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,350
I'm sure there are people
who hate me all over.

48
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,990
So, what about Yuki?

49
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,180
Apparently she ran away from home
and said not to look for her.

50
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,680
Then my wife canceled the search.

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm not convinced, though.

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,150
I won't believe it until I see her face.

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,070
Is that how kids are these days?

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,270
I don't think Yuki's that kind of girl.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,230
Another celebrity was caught cheating.
What do you think, sir?

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,610
You know what I think? Who cares?

57
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,000
You'd better not be slacking off again.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,020
Sorry.

59
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,960
Another bill for you.

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,960
Thanks.

61
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,620
I sure did everything I could
for my first job.

62
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,000
It made me realize everyone's got a history.
A life. Even ordinary taxi drivers.

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,330
What do we do with this information?

64
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,530
What about the illegal stuff?
Should we retrieve it?

65
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,010
Odokawa could be involved
in a criminal case.

66
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,660
We can't leave things the way they are.

67
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,080
We already looked into that.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,550
He was just a regular middle-aged guy.

69
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,760
Besides, he drives dozens
of passengers a day.

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,400
It's not that odd if one of them
went missing.

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,770
That one passenger was
my junior in high school,

72
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,200
and she might've gotten
mixed up in something.

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,600
Well, I don't know your high school junior.

74
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,030
Oh, yeah?

75
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,280
At this agency, you're my junior.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,930
Guess I shouldn't care about you, either.

77
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,520
You can do the rest of this yourself.

78
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,870
Ibu, one of your young 'uns
went to see Don-chan.

79
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,020
I told her not to.

80
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,480
You didn't put her up to it?

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,080
The girl's her junior from back home.

82
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,360
Once she gets into something,
she acts indiscriminately.

83
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,360
Yeah?

84
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,200
That's no good.

85
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,800
Please just leave her alone.

86
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,950
If anything happens to her,
then I'll be forced to act.

87
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,850
Why hasn't the girl been found yet, anyway?

88
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,160
Doesn't make sense.

89
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,600
This shouldn't be that difficult.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,160
Well...

91
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,800
So, actually...

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,360
After aggressively haggling over his fare,

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,570
that chatty passenger said he was
going to buy lottery tickets

94
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,700
so he could buy up some idol group's CDs.

95
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,790
I made up a random number on the spot,

96
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,770
and he rushed right over to buy a ticket.

97
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,350
I was like, "Seriously? You still had money?"

98
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,040
Hey, are you listening?

99
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,410
Love is both a painful and beautiful thing.

100
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,950
Dude, don't. Did something happen to you?

101
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,720
She's just a little girl.

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,640
She's still only 18.

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,270
So far we've only exchanged messages,
but we get along great.

104
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,270
We're supposed to meet up soon.

105
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,400
But she's too busy to meet, right?

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,650
I know what you're trying to say.

107
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,650
You think she doesn't exist, don't you?

108
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,160
She's really real.

109
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,950
Kakihana-san!!
Good luck at work

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,950
Are you sure you're not being tricked?

111
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,690
Here you are.

112
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,880
Are you jealous?

113
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,930
Of course not.

114
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,930
Think about it. You said so yourself.

115
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,470
There's no demand for us
in the marriage marketplace.

116
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,730
I'm telling you, it's the feeling—

117
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,270
You've never even met her.
How can there be any feeling?

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,890
Look.

119
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,870
Let me see your profile.

120
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,170
No.

121
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:56,840
Give it.

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,420
Quit it.

123
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,030
Give it.

124
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,110
That's my personal information.

125
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,110
Give it.

126
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,700
Kakihana Eiji
Occupation: IT Worker
Annual Income: 20,000,000 yen
Education: College

127
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,080
These specs you lied about
way outshine any kind of feeling.

128
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,700
I know.

129
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,540
But still, I wanna dream.

130
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,680
Ibusuki?

131
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,700
The guy who used to help us out
runs a detective agency now.

132
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,190
Come to think of it, some youngster
was sniffing around your territory.

133
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,420
Was he one of Ibusuki's guys?

134
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,390
Dunno, but I gave him a beating.

135
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,050
I'm telling you, you've gotta
learn to use your head.

136
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,630
If this is true, I'll have
to offer compensation.

137
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,650
Don-chan will be dragged into this, too.

138
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,220
What do you say, Dobu?
Could you clean up my mess again?

139
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,960
I'm begging you.

140
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,660
You want me to protect Yano?

141
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,200
Not protect him.

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,050
I'm asking you to let me settle this.

143
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,870
I'm doing this for your sake, too.

144
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,860
Kabasawa-sama?

145
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,800
Hey. Rena-chan?

146
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes.

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,980
Wow.

148
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,600
I bought this car and condo, too.

149
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,970
But now that I have them,
I'm kind of disappointed.

150
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,460
Maybe I spent too much.

151
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,500
No way. You're trying to make
the world a better place.

152
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,480
You deserve this level of luxury.

153
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,350
Thank you for waiting.

154
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,130
Oh, I can't drink.

155
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,630
You're 19, right?

156
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,280
Yeah.

157
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,020
Oh, right. Right, of course.

158
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,270
I'm supposed to be a model citizen.
I shouldn't be acting like this.

159
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,190
Since the police are no help at all, we all
have high hopes for you, Kabasawa-sama.

160
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,740
You can count on me.

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,530
That's why I'm hoping
you'll get my laptop back.

162
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,820
I've got lots of important data saved on it.

163
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,700
Where does Dobu normally hang out?

164
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,130
Apparently you picked up
the missing high school girl from Nerima.

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,570
I handed over my dash cam data
to the police a while ago.

166
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,040
I have a request.

167
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,470
What's that?

168
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,080
I need you to keep your mouth shut.

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,570
Daimon already told me
to keep my mouth shut.

170
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,880
Not just the police. Don't tell anybody.

171
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,930
Don't tell anybody? Like who?

172
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,200
Everybody.

173
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,820
Tell 'em you lost your dash cam data.

174
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,480
So, what do you want help with?

175
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,310
If anyone shows up looking
for your dash cam data,

176
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,860
I want you to let me know.

177
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,320
And if I refuse?

178
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,490
I'll kill you.

179
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,930
Let me handle the laptop.

180
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,350
I promise I'll get it back once I catch Dobu.

181
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,420
Anyway, what do you want to do after this?

182
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,140
Wanna come to my place?

183
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,890
You piece of shit.

184
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,600
Huh? What was that?

185
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,430
I don't know...

186
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,600
Sometimes I want to be spoiled by
someone who sees me as Kabasawa Taichi.

187
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,790
Everyone calls me a hero, but
men who fight need breaks, too.

188
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,220
Today let's forget about everything
and have fun, Rena-chan.

189
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,620
So, when do you think you'll take down Dobu?

190
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,980
I said let's forget about Dobu today.

191
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,590
Hurry up and become a real hero.

192
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,240
Did you know you're
getting more haters recently?

193
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,820
"Kabasawa isn't a hero.
He's just desperate for recognition."

194
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,210
"He's scared of Dobu. Just a one-hit wonder."

195
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,470
"He's sleeping with his female followers."

196
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,280
Wait, that last one might be true.

197
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,390
I was frustrated that I couldn't
tell them they're wrong.

198
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,790
But after seeing how
you've been acting recently...

199
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,150
Shut up.

200
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,030
What?

201
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,410
You don't know anything about me.

202
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,430
I stirred up a sensation
and put myself in harm's way.

203
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,390
I didn't ask to be deified, okay?

204
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,630
You don't know what the pressure is like.

205
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,050
It's terrifying.

206
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,260
Don't project your fantasies onto me.

207
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,000
You got to dream, too, didn't you?

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,590
Who do you have to thank for that, huh?

209
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,890
Crap.

210
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,810
Hello, Rena-san?

211
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,790
Where are you?

212
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,090
And what happened to Taeko-san's
report? It's weirdly dry.

213
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,290
What have you been doing with Kabasawa?

214
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,350
Are you slacking off again?

215
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,220
Dobu was in Odokawa's car.

216
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,990
What? Why?

217
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,150
Not only that, but Dobu demanded Odokawa's
cooperation and threatened to kill him.

218
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,580
Wait, wait. The dash cam caught all of that?

219
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,690
We should call the police.

220
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,970
What are we going to tell the police?

221
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,390
We're filming him without his knowledge.

222
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,840
Hold on. Did you use my computer
without my permission?

223
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,970
But you left it open.

224
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,410
I hope Dobu hits you again.

225
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,370
Gimme a break, here!

226
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,000
Anyway, I'm going to follow Dobu.

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,840
What?

228
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm going to get my data back
and solve this mystery.

229
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,250
With my photos, we might be able to
find your high school junior.

230
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,420
We'll be able to give the banker's
wife her evidence, too!

231
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,650
How?

232
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,920
I'll steal my laptop
back while he's sleeping.

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,100
Are you stupid?

234
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,020
There's no way you'll make it out
unscathed if you go alone.

235
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,770
You told me to handle it myself, though.

236
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,020
That's not what I meant!

237
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,360
Because of you, I'm eating
yakiniku by myself.

238
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
Why are you having yakiniku?

239
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,730
Because I'm in the middle of following him.

240
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,930
Please don't make any decisions by yourself.

241
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,150
Don't try to solve anything, either.

242
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,340
Limit yourself to just watching him.

243
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,420
Got it. But you know, I had
more than two choices this time.

244
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,750
I chose from out of at least ten. Bye!

245
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,830
Ten...? Hey, wait!

246
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,960
I've snuck into Dobu's hideout!

247
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,010
Ow, ow, ow!

248
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,090
Let go!

249
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,060
Ow, ow, ow!

250
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,630
Mercy! I'm sorry!

251
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,270
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

252
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,330
What?

253
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,950
Listen, my boss is trying to
construct a building here.

254
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,930
I know all his henchmen.

255
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:34,420
Naturally, all the construction
workers are his guys, too.

256
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,480
You know what that means, don't you?

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,500
Um, there's joy in creating
something with your friends?

258
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,090
Ow, ow, ow!

259
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,640
I don't know.

260
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,000
You need to be direct with me. I'm not
good at reading between the lines.

261
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Scream all you want.
No one's coming to help you.

262
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,740
I've got the solvents I need to
 dissolve your corpse right here.

263
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,280
If I bury you, they'll never find anything.

264
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,710
No, wait. I've only lived 24 years.

265
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,770
You think your life's just
getting started, huh?

266
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,510
I do. I finally got a job recently.

267
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,710
It's boring right now, but
I'm hoping things will pick up.

268
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,400
So for now, I'm being patient
and working really hard.

269
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,520
Why did you follow me?

270
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,050
It was a coincidence.

271
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,940
Who put you up to it?

272
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,690
This happens to me all the time.

273
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,430
I run into my teachers from school
when I go traveling.

274
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,920
Really. I'm serious.

275
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,840
Uh-huh. I've got one question for you.

276
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,810
Okay.

277
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,160
It's a simple, two-choice question.

278
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,620
Two choices...

279
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:05,170
Do you prefer your right finger
or your left finger?

280
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,010
But I've got ten.

281
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,120
I can't answer the phone right now—

282
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,520
I can't answer the phone right now.
Please call again later.

283
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,950
I see. A background check on Odokawa, huh?

284
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,460
Then you should be following him.

285
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:34,100
I happened to see you while watching him
and wondered how you were doing.

286
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,810
Terribly, obviously.

287
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,890
Right.

288
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,150
Hold on. What do you mean, you saw me?

289
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,020
Well, uh...

290
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,590
Oh, the camera. It's the camera
in Odokawa's car, isn't it?

291
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,900
It's called a dash cam.

292
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,730
I don't give a shit.

293
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,940
So, how come you can see what's on that?

294
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,540
Ow, ow, ow!

295
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,360
Don't invoke your duty of
 confidentiality when it suits you.

296
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,230
Are you working with Odokawa, too?

297
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,880
What do you mean, working with him?!

298
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,290
Aren't you working with him?!

299
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,610
All right, fine. Then you're
gonna help me, too.

300
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,740
What?

301
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,210
What is this?

302
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,420
Anything but that, please!

303
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,130
She's your girl, huh?

304
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,570
Oh, well... I'm not sure
what she thinks, but...

305
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,220
Personally, I don't think
it's out of the question...

306
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,670
She's not gonna go to the cops
if she doesn't hear from you,

307
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,690
and you don't have a GPS up your ass, right?

308
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,130
Nope, she doesn't care
about me at all. Sadly.

309
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,450
And yet, her name's in your
contacts without honorifics.

310
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,650
Yes.

311
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,790
I'm going to tell you everything
I know about Odokawa.

312
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,600
I've already investigated that thoroughly.

313
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,910
What?

314
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,250
I already know plenty.

315
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,940
What?

316
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,660
Ow!

317
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,200
What do you want help with?

318
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,170
What is it, Driver?

319
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,340
I feel like I've seen her before.

320
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,150
Whatever. Let's get moving.

321
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,110
She keeps her face hidden.

322
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,990
If you recognize her face, you must've
come to her concert before she debuted.

323
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,500
Is she a singer or something?

324
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,920
That's not it, then.
I've never been to a concert.

325
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,680
Are you okay? Are you tired?

326
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,180
Is Nikaido-san coming?

327
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,580
Later.

328
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,120
Did she do something?

329
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,380
I can't keep up with her ambition.

330
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,030
You can work at your own pace, Ichimura.

331
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,410
She's incredible. I bet she'd
kill someone just to get ahead.

332
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,390
She probably already has, honestly.

333
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,980
What are you talking about?

334
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,040
Maybe I'm not suited to this job.

335
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,700
Mitsuya's already inside.

336
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,970
I don't like her.
I liked things better before.

337
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,740
What are you looking at?

338
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,380
Head towards the Kamimeguro
intersection next.

339
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,790
There's a building nearby.

340
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,680
Kamimeguro?

341
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,010
Yeah.

342
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:52,070
I was just thinking about how I once drove
a girl around that other girl's age there.

343
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,940
What? When?

344
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,290
About two weeks ago, I think.
She must've been from your agency.

345
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,560
I'm surprised you remember,
but it must've been someone else.

346
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,280
She was a young girl taking a pretty
long trip in the middle of the night.

347
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,530
Not only that, but she
called herself an idol.

348
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,890
Are you sure it wasn't
the girl we just dropped off?

349
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,740
But she's a calico cat.

350
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,570
What does that mean?

351
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,850
You're sure you dropped off
that girl at this office?

352
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,640
Yeah.

353
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,320
Listen, Driver.

354
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,970
Does this car have a recording device?

355
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,340
Why?

356
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,720
Sometimes you see them in the news.

357
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,040
You know, in stories about robberies.

358
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,810
Yeah, I've got one.

359
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,560
Any chance I could get your data?

360
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,000
What? You finally picked up.

361
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,080
Where'd you wander off to?
You weren't answering your phone.

362
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,470
Sorry.

363
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,070
The boss is hiding something.

364
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,350
He was with some shady people yesterday.

365
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,350
I see.

366
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,940
You're awfully low-energy today.

367
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,970
I'm at the hospital right now.

368
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,560
What? Why? Did Dobu do something to you?

369
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,600
Oh, no. Actually, I lost him
while I was tailing him.

370
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
Then why?

371
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,140
I fell down the stairs and broke my pinkie.

372
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,120
Liar.

373
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,210
I might've found the taxi
Mitsuya took that day.

374
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,640
And?

375
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,140
Apparently the driver remembers her.

376
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,880
What should we do?

377
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,530
Where is Yuki now?

378
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:15,720
Next Time

379
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,190
Do you think Donraku-san
is hiding something?

380
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,100
We're partners, Rena. Buddies!

381
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,450
Something definitely happened to you.

382
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,280
You tell me the truth, got it?

383
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,580
This is where they practice.

384
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,470
Shiho-chan, do you actually
want to get married?

385
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,860
This show is a work of fiction.
