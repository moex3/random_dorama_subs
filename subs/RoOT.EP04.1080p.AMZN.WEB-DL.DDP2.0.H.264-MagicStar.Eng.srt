1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,150
Shofutei Donraku

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,400
There have always been
shady rumors about him.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,210
They're mostly true, too.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,210
At first he only asked them for favors
to protect his daughter and me,

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,170
but the more involved he got
with them, the weirder things got.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,040
Weird how?

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,050
I'm sure he felt pressured
to do it for his art,

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:37,350
but he'd get drunk and wild all the time
and end up hurting regular people.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,310
They'd settle matters like that for him.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,200
They killed a tabloid article about
him having a child with his mistress.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,160
Then there's all the stuff I don't know.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,060
For a period of time, he relied
on them for everything.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,570
That's why you and Yuki-san
moved back in with your parents?

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,580
I was running away. For Yuki's sake, too.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,050
Where is Yuki now?

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,820
Have you heard from her since then?

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,380
Well, Donraku told me not to tell anyone.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,120
Do you think he's hiding something?

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,030
I don't know.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,210
Could I take a look around Yuki-san's room?

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,780
I may be able to find some clues.

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,150
The police took a bunch of things
when this all started.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,590
Nothing's been returned yet.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,980
I won't tell Ibusuki-san about this.

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,040
In exchange, please don't tell
Donraku that I talked to you.

26
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,580
That's Yuki's number.

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,970
If you're her friend, they
might not find you suspicious.

28
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,360
What? That's all?!

29
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,180
Are you sure you're a detective?

30
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,110
I'm watching him, just like you told me to.

31
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,550
He hasn't done anything
out of the ordinary yet.

32
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,790
A high school girl has been missing
for roughly ten days.

33
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,300
Since this morning, the MPD
has been speaking to a taxi driver

34
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,860
who may know something about the situation.

35
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,030
The missing person is an 18-year-old high
school girl from Nerima Ward in Tokyo.

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,940
It's unsettling, isn't it?

37
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,850
According to the investigation, the high
school girl was last seen ten days ago,

38
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,910
entering a taxi in Nerima Ward
before she went missing...

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,930
You think they're talking about Odokawa?

40
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,280
Calm down.

41
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,050
Until recently, you were acting like
you'd done everything you possibly could.

42
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,930
What's with the attitude?

43
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,810
It's not like you weren't furious, too.

44
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,220
Fine. Does that mean you're
okay with helping me?

45
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,140
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,970
We're partners, Rena. Buddies! Best buds!

47
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,060
There, there. Good boy.

48
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,760
So, Dobu kidnapped a famous
high school girl to ransom her,

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,400
colluded with police to hide the evidence,
and stole a taxi driver's dash cam.

50
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,590
The taxi driver got dragged into it
because he knows something,

51
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,930
and now he's being threatened.

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,180
Uh, what?

53
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,340
Or else Odokawa and Dobu are actually
working together, and it's the police who—

54
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,170
Can we stop talking about Dobu-san?

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,570
Well, that's quite the change in attitude.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,260
Something definitely happened to you.

57
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,310
Nobody falls down the stairs
and breaks just one finger.

58
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,360
Yes?

59
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,820
Um, I'm here about the missing person.

60
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,700
I called the office.

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,680
Ah, we've been waiting for you!

62
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,320
Please, come in.

63
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,990
Rena-chan.

64
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,890
Got it!

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,460
Right this way.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,960
Thank you for waiting.

67
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,540
Kobayashi Tome

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,800
Why didn't you tell me sooner
that we have a database like this?

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,410
I told you just now.

70
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,860
We have access to it
through the boss' old job.

71
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,150
Huh.

72
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,020
The major offices have their own,
but we have to use whatever we can.

73
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,020
There she is. Kobayashi Tome, 84 years old.

74
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,060
She lives right by the client.

75
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,020
You're right.

76
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,940
It's always hardest to see
what's right under your nose.

77
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,120
I hope we can find everyone this easily.

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,090
And we get paid to do this? Easy money.

79
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,630
I wish class reunions were
the only thing we worked on.

80
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,410
You want me to end your
training period right now?

81
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,760
Finding people is a real job, okay?

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,200
Can I see something?

83
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,060
There's a lot of people
you won't find in there.

84
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,430
Mitsuya

85
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,150
What's her name? Mitsuya something.

86
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,870
Yuki. Only other people show up
when you search for her.

87
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,520
Come to think of it,
did she answer her phone?

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,630
Nope. I've just been getting voicemail.

89
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,950
Oh, you're right. Mitsuya Yuki.

90
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,670
81 years old, 51 years old...

91
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,220
Huh? It's ringing.

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,520
I knew it. I thought now would be—

93
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,230
Yuki?

94
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,770
Who is this?

95
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,730
This information will cost you.

96
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,530
It took a lot of time to restore it, too.

97
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,570
The contents?

98
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,610
It's all on here.

99
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,210
If I were you, I wouldn't
go snooping through phones.

100
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,850
Can you show me who Yuki called
the day she went missing?

101
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,040
Of course.

102
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,250
Nikaido Rui

103
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,980
She got a bunch of calls
from the same person.

104
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,980
In the middle of the night, too. Who is she?

105
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,120
Oh! She's an idol from that website
we looked at the other day.

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,260
What were they called?

107
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,080
Mystery Kiss?

108
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,090
Yeah.

109
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,790
Hey, this is that girl
you got really excited about.

110
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,010
Nikaido Rui.

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,160
First of all, tell me how right I was.

112
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,540
What? Does that mean their member
Mitsuya Yuki is our Yuki?

113
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,400
But you met her, right? And it wasn't her.

114
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,700
Something's fishy.

115
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,310
It's been a while since this
phone's owner went missing, right?

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,730
Yeah, which means there's no way she's okay.

117
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,830
Hey! Pay up.

118
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,430
C'mon. You gotta trust me.

119
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,530
Fine. I'm sorry for doubting you.

120
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,850
But you tell me the truth, got it?

121
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm telling you, I don't know.

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,550
I've never said a word about your business.

123
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,980
If something happened,
"I don't know" isn't gonna cut it.

124
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,980
My own guys are looking everywhere for
that girl right now, but we can't find her.

125
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,520
She's about to debut, y'know?
We ain't happy about this, either.

126
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Why are you suddenly so
interested in her, anyway?

127
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,290
Little girl idol groups aren't for us.

128
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,890
We shouldn't be involved in business
that's likely to cause trouble.

129
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm worried about her because
 she's my friend's daughter.

130
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,850
Boss, um, about the girl—

131
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,020
Sekiguchi, did I ask you a question?

132
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:25,100
Yano, even if you're not involved, try doing
anything that makes you look suspicious.

133
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,000
You'll be tripped up by the cops
and other groups.

134
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,060
I know. I'll be careful.

135
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Meanwhile, Dobu still thinks
he can rely on brawn

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,060
and is talking about some crackpot
job that'll make him a billion yen.

137
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,430
We used to do so well back then.

138
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,420
What happened to us?

139
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,660
A billion?

140
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,110
Be careful what you say
about other people's work, boss.

141
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,330
Why are you suddenly so
interested in Odokawa?

142
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,750
We can't rule it out as a possibility.

143
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,570
But there's no evidence of that.
It's a false accusation.

144
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,300
We don't even know if it's Odokawa
the police are questioning.

145
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,560
So, where are we going?

146
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,350
Here. This is where they practice.

147
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,320
Seriously? This stinks of overtime.

148
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,690
You said you'd help me.

149
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,820
Sorry! Thanks for waiting!

150
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,130
Ready for overtime.

151
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,970
Nice to meet you. I'm Kanon.

152
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,730
I'm Sato.

153
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,490
Hello.

154
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,360
Nice to meet you.

155
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,610
You, too.

156
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,500
What?

157
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm Sato. Nice to meet you.

158
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,460
Quit it.

159
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,670
Cool, huh?

160
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,870
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

161
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,140
Try touching it.

162
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,860
Why?

163
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,890
It's hard.

164
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,900
You're right. It's so hard.

165
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,360
I wrapped it myself.

166
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
Uh-huh.

167
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,260
Rena-san, how'd you figure this out?

168
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,950
I just looked for someplace a small
agency's three-woman idol group

169
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,980
could practice together.

170
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,610
Uh-huh.

171
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,360
They haven't made their mainstream
debut yet, so privacy isn't that important.

172
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,410
Also, they probably still need
to come up with choreography

173
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,180
and will need to use the space frequently,

174
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,600
so it has to offer either discounts
or reasonable prices.

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,880
Also, it should be either along their
agency's transit line, or easy to reach by taxi.

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,340
You're totally a detective.

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,340
Totally a detective.

178
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,450
Ew, no.

179
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,410
Good work, everyone.

180
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,110
Thank you.

181
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,650
When are we meeting next week?

182
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
Can you see them?

183
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,450
Yeah, totally.

184
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,350
The other two are surprisingly cute, too.

185
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,750
You're on Shimura. I've got Mitsuya.
You're on Nikaido.

186
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,750
You'll make your train, right?

187
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,250
Yes.

188
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, good night.

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,790
They're leaving, right?

190
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,270
Yeah, let's go.

191
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,820
I'm counting on you.

192
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,100
Roger that.

193
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,450
One, please.

194
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,950
Any seat you prefer?

195
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,270
911.

196
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:20,590
I might be able to get her
real name at reception.

197
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,490
911. Got it.

198
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,760
I might be able to get her
real name at reception.

199
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:36,310
Nikaido Rui lives in a luxury high-rise apartment!

200
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,900
Here you are.

201
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,450
Thank you.

202
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,480
Nikaido Rui lives in a luxury high-rise apartment!

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,860
She entered a restaurant with a middle-aged man.

204
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,760
Can I help you?

205
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,070
She entered a restaurant with a middle-aged man.

206
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:48,700
Bet he's her sugar daddy.

207
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,780
What?

208
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,660
If you could fill in this form—

209
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,500
Oh, I'm good. Sorry.

210
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,980
I'm good. Excuse me.

211
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,280
Are you meeting someone?

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,890
Yes.

213
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,510
Sorry.

214
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,310
It's fine. I wasn't expecting
to get to eat at a place like this.

215
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,430
So, how's it look?

216
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,930
Like I said, that's her sugar daddy.

217
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,360
Look at how unenthusiastic she is.

218
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,760
Excuse me.

219
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,330
Could I get another glass, please?

220
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,530
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,590
So, uh, I got you something.
I hope you like it.

222
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,920
Huh. Thanks.

223
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,740
Shiho-chan, when are you the happiest?

224
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,250
When I'm in the bath.

225
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,990
Is the bath at your house
as amazing as I think it is?

226
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,340
Can you stretch your legs out?

227
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,660
Huh? Uh, yeah.

228
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,410
Its got jets and stuff. Of course it does.

229
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,410
Really?

230
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,810
Can you watch TV from the bath, too?

231
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,570
Of course.

232
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,640
Does the water come out of a lion's head?

233
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,500
A lion?

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,300
Shiho. So that's Ichimura Shiho.

235
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,090
I can't figure out what she's after.

236
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,850
Just money, right?

237
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,230
But isn't it risky for an idol
to use her real name?

238
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,770
I'm sure they've all got side gigs.

239
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,440
I bet only a handful of girls
make enough just off performing.

240
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,520
Some girls who play in bands
at my place also work as entertainers.

241
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,370
She could at least use a fake name.

242
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,910
Are they making her do it on purpose?

243
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,530
To create something to blackmail her with.

244
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,330
The question is, who's making her do it?

245
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,020
Is it a man?

246
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,990
Or her agency.

247
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
Her agency?

248
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,060
Shiho-chan, do you actually
want to get married?

249
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,210
Yeah. It's always been
my dream to get married.

250
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,140
I think the sooner I can, the better.

251
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,850
Being surprised with an
engagement ring would be amazing.

252
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,740
A ring.

253
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,640
Yeah.

254
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,000
In that case, would you—

255
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,590
Hey, look at this.

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,910
It says he won one billion yen.
Do you think it's true?

257
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,790
One billion yen, huh? Wow.

258
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,430
Not even I have that much.

259
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,620
He's a Nikaido Rui fan, huh?

260
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,940
Are you getting married or engaged?

261
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,900
Actually, uh...

262
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,990
Would you like to see the back?

263
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,470
Taeko-san wants to see you, Rena-san.

264
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,920
How much have you been drinking on your own?

265
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,020
You just don't understand
how I feel, Rena-san.

266
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,800
Sorry I'm not more considerate.

267
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,510
I feel sick.

268
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,650
Here.

269
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,750
Pull yourself together.

270
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,830
Why is Ichimura Shiho
meeting Odokawa's friend?

271
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,060
Kakihana-san? He was there yesterday, too.

272
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,930
And?

273
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,010
So he was there yesterday.
He's a regular there.

274
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,810
He was complaining about
how expensive rings are.

275
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,640
That's it? Why do you
even bother going there?

276
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,330
Then share more of your information with—

277
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,130
Ow!

278
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,240
I'll be back.

279
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,270
See you later.

280
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,530
See you later!

281
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,880
Hey, why do you think an active
idol would have a sugar daddy?

282
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,930
Is it possible that she needs the money?

283
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,400
Kanon said the same thing. It's possible...

284
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,500
But that Ichimura girl
seemed unhappy to be there.

285
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,120
Someone must be making her do it.

286
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,520
I definitely don't think
Yuki would allow it to happen.

287
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:16,160
So Mitsuya Yuki found out about it
and was killed when she tried to quit?

288
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,270
Killed? Don't say stuff like that.

289
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,090
Sorry.

290
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,580
It could be that she just wanted to
be alone and left the country.

291
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,320
Has she always been that kind of person?

292
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,000
Or else someone is keeping her quiet,
or she's being held captive somewhere.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,890
No way. A lot of time has passed
already. That can't be...

294
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,890
She's alive. She's definitely alive.

295
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,190
Wanna stop by Taeko's place tonight?

296
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,080
Nah. I'm working tonight.

297
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,580
Hey, don't.

298
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,160
Why not? Taeko said she
misses seeing your face.

299
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,040
Are you listening, Kakihana?

300
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,840
I had fun the other day! Good luck at work

301
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,630
Hey.

302
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,560
Hey, good to see you again.

303
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,140
How're you doing?

304
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,160
Yeah, great.

305
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,970
Hey.

306
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,640
Good to see you.

307
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Is 50 enough?

308
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,440
Yup.

309
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,100
You good?

310
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,110
It's cold tonight.

311
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,840
My wallet's feeling a bit drafty, too.

312
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,180
Give 'em a kick in the ass.

313
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,390
My girls are working hard, you know.

314
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,680
Why can't I win the lottery or something?

315
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,600
Just kidding.

316
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,630
What?

317
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,010
Haven't you heard?

318
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,300
Everyone's talking about it online.

319
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

320
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,450
Apparently one of our oldest fans
won a billion yen in the lottery.

321
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,650
Tell me more about that.

322
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,140
I think I'm going crazy
from looking at too many cats.

323
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,890
Enough. These definitely
aren't the right cat.

324
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,790
But I think I'm starting to see it.

325
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,150
Rena, you got a second?

326
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,830
Good morning.

327
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,320
Morning!

328
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,260
What is it?

329
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,640
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

330
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,730
What are you talking about?

331
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,520
You'll never survive unless you
work on your shadowing skills.

332
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,900
I understand how you feel after all
you've seen over the past few days.

333
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,510
Why don't you take a little vacation?

334
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,610
Why?

335
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,370
If you don't, I'm firing you.

336
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,470
Is that your decision, boss?

337
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,470
Yes.

338
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,270
Then I quit.

339
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,290
What?

340
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,630
Sato and I are quitting.

341
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,790
Not Sato.

342
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,020
What?

343
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,810
Fine.

344
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,810
As of today, I no longer work for you.

345
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,900
You have nothing to do
with my future investigations.

346
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,610
But until I find my footing,

347
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm going to keep using my desk,
computer, and other equipment.

348
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,230
I'll pay whatever it costs.

349
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,950
What do you mean? I don't understand.

350
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,670
Fine.

351
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,710
Well, you understood.

352
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,730
You can do whatever you want,
but in exchange, I can't protect you.

353
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,780
You got that?

354
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,850
Yes.

355
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,090
He's actually real.

356
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,410
So, this is Imai-kun's place?

357
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,050
Yeah.

358
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,560
Detectives are amazing.
They know everything.

359
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,940
More like he made everything public,
including the fact that he won a billion yen.

360
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,860
He might just be an idiot.

361
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,870
Okay, let's check it out.

362
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,070
What are we trying to find out about Imai?

363
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,630
I thought he might know
something about Yuki.

364
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,260
He's one of Mystery Kiss' oldest fans.

365
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,250
Also, the driver I was investigating
frequently looks for passengers around here,

366
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,460
so he's probably given him a ride.

367
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,080
Here?

368
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,220
Is this it?

369
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,980
What's this? You two are really cute.

370
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,170
You interested in our place?

371
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,410
A little, I guess?

372
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,220
Oh, I know. You need money, don't you?

373
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,610
Is there an Imai-san here?

374
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,780
Yeah. He's working today.

375
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,580
You wanna see him?

376
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,620
Can we?

377
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,820
Show them inside.

378
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,430
Watch your step.

379
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,760
Okay.

380
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:15,910
Next Time

381
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,570
What did Mitsuya-san learn that day?

382
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,390
I won one billion yen!

383
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,320
My only clues are the calls from Nikaido.

384
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,660
Every encounter and parting
of ways is inevitable.

385
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,450
I'm a huge Rui-tan fan.

386
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,900
This show is a work of fiction.

387
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,260
I've never given you a ride, have I?
