1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,350
Sorry.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,540
What are you doing?
Is this your first day or something?

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,370
Sorry. I'm new here.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,800
Sorry. Excuse me.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,600
Rena-san. Rena-san.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,060
We're out of damp towels. Are you all right?

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,820
Whoa, whoa. Are you okay?

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,820
You're soaking wet.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,250
Sorry. Excuse me.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,710
Hey, wait.

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,090
That guy's a regular,
but he loves new people.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,920
Rena, are you okay?

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,850
I'm totally fine. I'm just
struggling to get used to it.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,470
You can take it one step
at a time. Take it slow.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,350
The cast are our treasure. Our idols.

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,760
Oh, right. Apparently Imai-san is
a hardcore idol fan, despite how he seems.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,810
The other day, he even went to a photo event.

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,930
Wow, you must really love Mystery Kiss.

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,320
Well, yeah. Actually...

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,060
I'm a huge Rui-tan fan.

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,160
Wow.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,000
I've been a fan longer than anyone else.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,830
Really?

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,220
Rena-san. Rena-san.
Someone's asking for you.

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,840
What?

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,900
Already, huh? You gotta get more fans.

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,640
Okay.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,180
You've got this.

29
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,130
I'll do my best.

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,760
Go get 'em.

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,180
What?

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm not cut out for this.

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,370
If you know that, then
what are you doing there?

34
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,620
Why? I got a job right away.

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,270
I thought you were looking for your junior.

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,910
I am. A huge Mystery Kiss fan works there.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,210
I thought I could get some
information out of him.

38
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,990
Besides, I have to pay all my own expenses.

39
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,400
I guess so.

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,980
If you don't like it, then stop helping me.

41
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,470
But if you do, then leave me alone.

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,760
Why would you say something
so extreme and sad?

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,970
Because the police, the yakuza, our boss,

44
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,260
and a big-name entertainer
are involved in this mess.

45
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,230
What do you expect?

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,180
Are you worried about my safety?

47
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,200
If you're not careful, you could end up dead.

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,070
It's not even your job anymore.

49
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,750
It's not like I can quit now, either.

50
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,450
Anyway, I can't believe
he fired you out of nowhere.

51
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,070
The boss is probably in a tight spot, too.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,880
That's why he set me free.

53
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,820
Anyway, are you doing okay at work?

54
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm fine for now.

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,230
Actually, I just blew half
my first paycheck on that.

56
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,760
That place is way too expensive.

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,670
Then you can pay me the other half directly.

58
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,560
I'll go get you a refill.

59
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,940
Hey, wait.

60
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,500
Anyway, I tried coming up with a theory.

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,810
You don't need to try so hard
to act like a detective.

62
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,910
Just listen.

63
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,960
On October 4th, the day
Mitsuya-san went missing,

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,080
she definitely got into Odokawa's taxi.

65
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,120
That taxi headed to Harada Building 3.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,670
So you still only know where
 she was until the convenience store—

67
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,960
Anyway, Mystery Kiss' agency
is inside that building.

68
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,250
The building is currently
owned by the yakuza.

69
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,390
Based on these facts, I think
these three groups are suspicious.

70
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,370
The question is, which of them found
Yuki's existence a nuisance, and why.

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:34,280
Yes. What did Mitsuya-san witness
and learn that day?

72
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,420
If we still haven't found
any evidence, that means

73
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,450
we're not dealing with a crime of passion
or repeat offender, but a premeditated crime.

74
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,320
Someone with a grudge against
Yuki herself or Donraku-san,

75
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,670
or someone involved with the criminal
organization the boss met with.

76
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,000
You think it's Odokawa?

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,320
What? Have you been listening?
That doesn't make sense.

78
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,750
I think we can limit ourselves to either
the agency or the criminal organization.

79
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,380
We should look into Odokawa more.

80
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,290
Sounds like you want it to be Odokawa.

81
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,770
Are you sure Dobu didn't do anything to you?

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,070
No? I mean, Odokawa's suspicious, right?

83
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,330
Why did Rena-san join this agency?

84
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,380
Oh, you haven't heard?

85
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,390
Well, she doesn't talk about herself much.

86
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,190
Despite how she seems,
she's actually been through a lot.

87
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,470
She's probably reluctant to open up about it.

88
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,470
True.

89
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,320
She's quick-witted. I bet she
studied really hard in school.

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,140
She must've been way above average.

91
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,380
She dropped out of high school.

92
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,980
What? Why?

93
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,900
Ask her yourself.

94
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,640
Oh, come on. Don't tease me
with partial information.

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,120
Oh, right. You wanna try
getting someone together?

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,080
What does that mean?

97
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,170
You really don't listen, do you?

98
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,690
I told you about it when you started.

99
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm talking about romantic engineering.

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,130
Getting people to meet
 or couples back together.

101
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,310
Making couples break up, reuniting them.

102
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,800
All as if it's a coincidence.

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,920
Romantic engineering?
That's something we do?

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,100
A long time ago, I once helped a big name
entertainer get together with someone.

105
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,720
That's kind of scary, like you're
manipulating people's lives.

106
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,530
In our world, every encounter
and parting of ways is inevitable.

107
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,040
Someone might be controlling you, too.

108
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,250
Come on. Let's go.

109
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,350
You almost had me for a second there.

110
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,640
Imai-san, good morning!

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,390
Good morning.

112
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,100
You're looking handsome again today!

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,170
Thanks. You're looking cute, too!

114
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,340
Let's do this, huh? Let's do this.

115
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,190
Hello.

116
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,720
Hello.

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,550
So, how was your trial
employment experience?

118
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,360
Feel like continuing to work here?

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,490
Honestly, it's not often that we get
people who could start right away.

120
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,870
Personally, I think it'd be
great if you could stay.

121
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,820
Maybe if you told us about
the billion yen you won.

122
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,700
What? Kanon-chan, how
do you know about that?

123
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,000
Imai-san.

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Everyone knows.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
Imai-san, I'm looking forward
to another day with you.

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
Same.

127
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,200
Don't you think it was risky
to post about it online?

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,760
People figured out where you work.

129
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,500
Is that why everyone's
been so nice to me recently?!

130
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,890
Wait, is that why you guys
started working here? For the cash?

131
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,940
What are you going to spend the money on?

132
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm going to invest all of it
into Mystery Kiss.

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,390
What? All of it?!

134
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,200
I wonder if Rui-tan saw
my post. It went viral.

135
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,960
One of the other members
liked my post. Ichi-something...

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,710
Ichimura?

137
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,910
Yeah. I just want Rui-tan to notice me.

138
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm just a regular guy,

139
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,680
but I thought I finally had
a chance to get her attention.

140
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,220
Morning, Imai-san.
Looking forward to another day.

141
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,600
Same.

142
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,490
Why did you win?

143
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,430
Why? Is there a reason other than luck?

144
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,580
Wow!

145
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,520
You're meant for the entertainment business.

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,290
But maybe it wasn't just luck.

147
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,670
The driver of the taxi
I happened to get in that day—

148
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,700
Don't you want to see the person
who made you lucky?

149
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,410
Hold on.

150
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,130
You're scaring me, Rena-chan.
How do you know how to find him?

151
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,120
This girl is amazing. She's a detective.
And we're childhood friends.

152
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,860
She left the boonies in Saitama
and went right to being a detective.

153
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,690
Kanon, careful what you say.

154
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,530
What's the problem? Imai-kun
doesn't seem like a bad guy.

155
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,800
Imai-kun, you say?

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,320
Wait, hold on. A detective?

157
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,550
Are you investigating me?

158
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,720
Oh, no. But I do know about that taxi driver.

159
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
His name is Odokawa.

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,630
I've been wanting to thank him,

161
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,600
but I took that taxi on a whim,
so I'd given up on the idea.

162
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,670
I know how you can see him.

163
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,430
But in exchange, could you
tell me about Mystery Kiss?

164
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,130
Of course! Ask me anything.

165
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,770
So, how can I see that Odokawa-san again?

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
Rena-san, hello.

167
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,990
Sato, can you check the computer for me?

168
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,750
Yes.

169
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,660
Where is Odokawa's taxi now?

170
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,730
Around this time, he's either driving
around the intersection at 3-chome

171
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,040
or waiting for passengers
around the Sansan Building.

172
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,810
Oh, yup. He's in front of the Sansan Building.

173
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,660
Got it.

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,530
Wait. Where are you right now, Rena-san?

175
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,280
Hello? Huh?

176
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,870
Apparently Imai-kun has been watching
Mystery Kiss since their first concert.

177
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,550
Yeah. It's fate. I just happened
to attend their concert.

178
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,420
I think it was a year ago.

179
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,060
Rui-tan was already
on another level back then.

180
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,880
Huh.

181
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,070
There were five of us
in the audience, and Rui-tan...

182
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,060
So, what was Mitsuya Yuki like?

183
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,520
She was especially good at dancing.

184
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,990
She seemed athletic.

185
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,110
Rui-tan's good at dancing,
and she's a good singer, too—

186
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,160
Do you have any video or
 photos of her from back then?

187
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,090
Oh, I wanna see!

188
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,520
I sure do.

189
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,680
She's so cute!

190
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,680
Cute!

191
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,860
Yeah, super cute.

192
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,080
Look at this one. Ah, she's so cute!

193
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Next, next, next.

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,660
This one is so cute.

195
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,280
Hey, you take too many pictures!

196
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,780
Where's Mitsuya Yuki?

197
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,240
Oh, I've only ever taken
Polaroids with Rui-tan.

198
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,830
Do you know any Mitsuya Yuki fans?

199
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,820
I'm clearly the only one who's
been following them forever,

200
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,280
and they only recently started
getting media attention

201
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,020
because they're making their major debut.

202
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,340
I doubt there's any photos of her.

203
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,180
Is that even possible?

204
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,490
There must at least be selfies or something.

205
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,120
Oh, right. Come to think of it,
they did a stream.

206
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,060
The members chatted
and answered fan questions.

207
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,580
Starting around 9 PM, Rui-tan—

208
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,420
Then has Mitsuya Yuki been
acting strange recently?

209
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,490
I have no idea.

210
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,530
Aside from Rui-tan, I feel like their
dancing's not as good as it used to be.

211
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,330
I mean, I can see why
they'd feel discouraged.

212
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,580
They have to wear masks
when they're finally debuting.

213
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,790
Right?

214
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,490
Is it possible Mitsuya Yuki
was replaced at some point?

215
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,080
Honestly, I really only
pay attention to Rui-tan.

216
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,810
Too much attention.

217
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,970
Oh, right. There's
an open audition coming up.

218
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,940
Mystery Kiss will be attending as guests.

219
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,850
Really? We should audition.

220
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,230
Why would we do that?

221
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,770
It's kind of frustrating, don't you think?
I'm definitely cuter than them.

222
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,830
I'd support you. You'd
totally make it to the final.

223
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,260
Right?

224
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,080
Yeah.

225
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,670
You're really here.

226
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,410
Hey, you're the idol fan.

227
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,750
Mystery Kiss.

228
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,880
You remember me?!

229
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,470
More importantly,
I'm glad I got to see you again.

230
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,760
Why?

231
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,960
I wanted to thank you.

232
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,560
What did I do?

233
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,250
I actually won the lottery using
those numbers you gave me.

234
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,020
Really? That's amazing.

235
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,440
That's not much of a reaction!

236
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,610
I mean, I picked those numbers at random.

237
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,700
You just haven't heard how much I won.

238
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,580
I won one billion yen!

239
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,770
Really?

240
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,620
Really!

241
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,360
I haven't claimed my winnings yet,

242
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,390
but I've checked it about a hundred times.

243
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,640
If that's true, you shouldn't
be spreading that around.

244
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,080
It's my first time telling
someone in real life.

245
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,020
I had to tell you.

246
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,230
What do you mean, in real life?

247
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,040
I told people online, but that's online.

248
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,780
I had to tell someone.

249
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,680
Now you can buy Mystery Kiss CDs.

250
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,470
That's right. I've been keeping
my winning ticket on me

251
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,410
so I can claim my winnings right
when their CD comes out.

252
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,190
You'd better not lose that.

253
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,180
Anyway, Odokawa-sama,
I wanted to thank you.

254
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,050
You don't need to do that.

255
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,310
No, no way! I've gotta do something!

256
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,990
Isn't there anything you need money for?

257
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,580
Not particularly.

258
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,800
Then, maybe your family or someone
you care about is in trouble?

259
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,510
Nope.

260
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,550
Do you just not feel desire?!

261
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,320
In that case, Odokawa-sama,
are you free right now?

262
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,740
As you can see, I'm right
in the middle of work.

263
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,370
I'll pay you whatever you'd make today.

264
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,300
Come with me.

265
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,600
Nice to meet you.

266
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,100
This is VIP Odokawa-sama.

267
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,980
Everything is already paid for,
so order whatever you'd like.

268
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,590
Really? Wow.

269
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,600
So cool!

270
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,840
Odokawa-san, what would you like to drink?

271
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,450
Actually, I've got to drive...

272
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,540
Is it okay if we drink?

273
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,460
Uh...

274
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,860
Sure, go ahead.

275
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,750
All right! Can we get
something bubbly, then?

276
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,490
Yeah, sure.

277
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,590
Yay!

278
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,350
Have you ever driven any famous people?

279
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,860
That's personal information.
I can't share that.

280
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,800
Aw, you're no fun.

281
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,220
What about girls our age?
Do you drive them a lot?

282
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,270
No, rarely.

283
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,390
I do frequently get requests for pick ups
and drop offs in this area, though.

284
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,260
Do you remember all your passengers?

285
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,560
I can't tell them apart.
Girls your age all look the same to me.

286
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,340
What? But we're totally different.

287
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,300
What?

288
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,140
I've never given you a ride, have I?

289
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,460
Ah, well, I work nights around here.

290
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,930
I might've gotten a ride
with you before. Why?

291
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,180
Rabbits aren't uncommon,
but you're a Polish rabbit.

292
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,250
What are you talking about, Odo-chan?

293
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,460
Are you the type of guy who
uses avant-garde pickup lines?

294
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,410
No, sorry. I don't belong here.

295
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,410
What about this girl?

296
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,720
A black cat.

297
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,330
What? No, I mean, have you
given her a ride before?

298
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,940
You, too?

299
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,780
She's my friend.

300
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,890
Sorry to ask out of nowhere.

301
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,380
No. I gave a black cat a ride,
but it wasn't her.

302
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,630
So, uh, why don't we have a toast?

303
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,760
If you've got something to say, then say it.

304
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,550
I looked into Rena-san's background.

305
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,630
She's in the company's database.

306
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,070
Hey, don't use that for personal matters.

307
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:38,890
I thoughtlessly looked out of pure
curiosity, and now I regret it.

308
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,890
That database gets used
for all kinds of credit checks.

309
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,200
People with criminal records,
people who have caused accidents.

310
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,050
Anyone who's experienced
twists and turns in life.

311
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,220
Those kinds of people
are more likely to end up on it.

312
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,650
Her parents died when she was young.

313
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,100
She went through a lot as a kid.

314
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,650
I wouldn't call it the silver lining,
but she was too young to remember.

315
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,420
She grew up in orphanages after that.

316
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,990
Is that why she became a detective?

317
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,190
No, she was just looking
for someplace to work.

318
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,840
Someone introduced her to me.

319
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,590
Don't worry. I'm also happy to hire people
like you who casually get into the business.

320
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,910
Is that right?

321
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,680
Since starting this job, I've learned
the world can be pretty unfair.

322
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,150
Rena said the same thing.

323
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,020
She said that made her glad
she became a private eye.

324
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,300
Despite how she seems,
she's got a strong sense of justice.

325
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,830
That's exactly how she seems.

326
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,630
Kakihana-san.

327
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,080
We know you're in there, Kakihana-san.

328
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,580
Hey, Kakihana. You need to
pay back what you borrowed.

329
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Didn't your parents teach you that?!

330
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,340
He's not here.

331
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,130
Let's go.

332
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,020
Sorry, I know you're busy with work.

333
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,230
Sorry, I know you're busy with work.

334
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,390
I'll wait forever, so don't
 strain yourself.

335
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,570
I'll wait forever, so don't
 strain yourself.

336
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,930
Sorry, I just finished. Where are you?

337
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,950
Yeah.

338
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,690
What the hell did you do to our girl?

339
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,690
No, wait. This is a misunderstanding.

340
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,750
I promise I'll pay off my debt soon.

341
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,190
Debt? Misunderstanding?
What are you talking about?

342
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,180
Did you think you could screw around
with her and get away with it?

343
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,270
You've got it all wrong.

344
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,790
Shiho-chan and I have
a serious platonic relationship.

345
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,300
She's a girl with a future.

346
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,220
I think you owe us compensation for damages.

347
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,000
You make twenty million a year, don't you?

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,040
N-No, I boosted my numbers a bit.

349
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,170
Don't lie to me.

350
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,120
That's a pretty nice suit you're wearing.

351
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,060
I took out a loan to buy this.

352
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,260
What? Loan this, debt that.

353
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,740
I thought you were rich.

354
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm in the cleaning business.

355
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,150
The cleaning business? So what?

356
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
Don't use your job as an excuse!

357
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm sorry!

358
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,840
Your profile is full of lies.

359
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,710
What is this?

360
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,840
No, wait. Anything but that.
It's for Shiho-chan—

361
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,910
An engagement ring?

362
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,140
What is this?

363
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,200
An open audition.

364
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,970
Yeah, I can see that.

365
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,800
We made it to the final round.

366
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,870
What? Who did?

367
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,020
Me and Kanon.

368
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,690
What?!

369
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,810
Keep your voice down.

370
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,300
When?

371
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,520
I submitted a karaoke recording
and video the other day.

372
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,930
Do you have a group name?

373
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,730
I can't tell you.

374
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,800
Wow, that's lame! I mean, uh...

375
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,780
Do you have any songs?

376
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,390
No, they gave us a song to sing.

377
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,410
Kanon and I are practicing like crazy.

378
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,330
I don't get it. Why are you
auditioning to become idols?

379
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,080
I'm going to join this agency
and investigate them.

380
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,760
It's too late for honest methods.
I've been stuck at an impasse for a while.

381
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,690
My only clue is the calls from Nikaido.

382
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,630
I'm running out of time.

383
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,300
Yeah, but...

384
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,090
You could've asked me for advice.

385
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,060
About working at the cabaret club, too.

386
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,460
What? That's your problem?

387
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,950
You know, it's been
bothering me for a while,

388
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,080
but you talk and act
like you're my boyfriend.

389
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,230
What?

390
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,380
No, not my boyfriend.
Something worse than that.

391
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,780
The preachy old men who come to the agency
to ask if I should be doing this job.

392
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,280
If that's how they feel,
they shouldn't be there.

393
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,400
What? That's... It's not on purpose.

394
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
Maybe you're just too self-conscious.

395
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,550
Well, it's not like I'm your
girlfriend or anything,

396
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,650
so why do you criticize what I do?

397
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,450
I'm just acting on my own judgment.

398
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,970
Rena-san, are you sure you're not
trying to reclaim your lost youth?

399
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,340
Just because you didn't graduate
from high school or college...

400
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,540
And now you're discriminating
based on my academic history.

401
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,360
That's not what I meant.

402
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,540
Thanks for the meal.

403
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,780
Hey, wait!

404
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Where are you going?

405
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,050
Home.

406
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,340
Oh, there's something else
that's been bothering me.

407
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,970
What is it?

408
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,900
Have you told anyone about Odokawa?

409
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,340
What? No. Of course not.

410
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,930
This is your last chance.

411
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,530
Taeko-san told me.

412
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,640
She said you repeatedly said how sorry
you were for what you did to Odokawa.

413
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,910
Oh, Taeko-san.

414
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,930
The truth is, Dobu-san threatened me,

415
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,230
and said something bad might
happen to you if I defied him.

416
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,630
I just wanted to protect you, so...

417
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,210
Listen, it sounds like you're trying to
spin this like you did something heroic,

418
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,770
but this only happened because you went
off to find Dobu's hideout on your own!

419
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,540
It was going well up until that point.

420
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,270
So, he told you to frame
an innocent man. Am I wrong?

421
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:12,390
Actually, when I told Dobu-san—I mean, Dobu—
that we were investigating Odokawa-san,

422
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,710
he told me to keep him informed
and keep an eye on him.

423
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,630
I did all of this for you, Rena-san.

424
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,700
Why'd you have to strike that jackpot?

425
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,750
Oh, well...

426
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,930
I suspected it before, but you really suck.

427
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,780
You always act like nothing's your fault.

428
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,770
It's written all over your face
that you grew up pampered.

429
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,630
That's— You don't know that, Rena-san!

430
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,850
I'm not taking that from someone
who never had a proper adolescence!

431
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,300
Not that you'd understand,
since you don't have parents.

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,820
Who told you that?

433
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,900
Is Mitsuya a stage name?

434
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Next Time

435
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,650
Why?

436
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,990
They're only trying to promote Nikaido-san.

437
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,150
I'm gonna rob a bank.

438
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,100
Did you kidnap her?

439
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,790
Who are you?

440
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,910
Shiho-chan!

441
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,180
I'll sell it to you.

442
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,910
How much?

443
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,750
One billion yen.

444
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,860
This show is a work of fiction.

445
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,870
We have a problem.
