1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,400
Cut!

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Okay, cut. That was good.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,780
We'll do the parking lot scene next.
We'll resume in 20 minutes.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,870
Also, everyone, Nikaido-sama brought
us some sweet buns. Thank you!

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,650
Thank you!

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,360
You were fantastic, Rui-chan.
That felt really real.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,400
Keep up the good work.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,250
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,240
Thank you, Director.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,990
Sure thing.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,710
You were great.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,050
Why do I have to do this?

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,790
What?

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,740
Hello.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,510
Come on, don't do this now.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,490
You're the one who said you couldn't
make it on singing and dancing alone.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,930
You're gonna get cast in bit parts to start.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,780
No, I mean why does it have to be this role?

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,000
There weren't any other options.

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,100
We couldn't say no after
they made a role just for you.

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,500
Well, thank you very much.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,580
What's wrong with you? Don't get so upset.

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,710
You're judging that audition tonight.

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,700
Be friendly. I'm counting on you, okay?

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,530
Hello.

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,970
Hello.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,500
Excuse me.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,600
Yes?

29
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,240
Are you two in Mystery Kiss?

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,950
Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,920
This actually isn't the first time.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,790
We've met before.

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,460
Oh, you were at the release event.

34
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,840
Oh, is that why?

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,260
It's not like we have any other female fans.

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,930
I'm so happy to be
standing onstage with you.

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,890
Wow, I'm impressed you
made it to the final ten.

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,560
It's just a coincidence.
How was your audition?

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,790
I think there were about a hundred people.

40
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,770
A hundred?

41
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,940
And the three of you were chosen?

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,070
Yeah. The three of us were chosen.

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,290
I guess people who survive
are a different breed.

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,410
Right?

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,830
How?

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,780
What?

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,180
They make us wear masks.

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,010
They're only trying to promote Nikaido-san.

49
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,370
Why?

50
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,670
Why? Because... I don't know.

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,630
It's probably the agency's strategy, right?

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,330
Are you two okay with that?

53
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,910
Sorry. Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

54
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,410
Good morning.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,150
What's wrong?

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,610
What is this? We're all
sharing a greenroom?

57
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,890
We've got a lot of people. We can't help it.

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,300
I want my own room.

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,150
But it's full of equipment and costumes.

60
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,760
Then install a partition here. Now.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,850
Hold on.

62
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,070
Hey. Nikaido, hey.

63
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,140
She's got a cute face, but...

64
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,790
Mitsuya-san, what is Nikaido-san like?

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,940
Like you just saw.
Strong-willed and hates to lose.

66
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,890
I wish I could talk to her.

67
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,100
I get it. Not even I feel like
I can casually talk to her.

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,580
She's been even more on edge since it was
decided we'd make our major debut.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,080
Mystery Kiss is kind of impressive, though.

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,790
You only had five fans to start, right?

71
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,770
Huh?

72
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,660
Oh, yeah. There was a time like that.

73
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,300
It was tough.

74
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,970
Is Mitsuya a stage name?

75
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,510
Why?

76
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,640
We have this high school junior we haven't
been able to get in touch with recently.

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,980
We're looking for her.

78
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,760
Her name is Mitsuya Yuki.

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,790
Hey, Kanon.

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,530
What?

81
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,680
What a coincidence.

82
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,030
Is your junior an idol, too?

83
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,420
I see. You must be worried.

84
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, so could you let me know
if you know anything?

85
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,750
Sure. I'll let you know
if anything comes up.

86
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,340
Thanks. Do you mind?

87
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,700
Look. Look at this.

88
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,390
I'm looking, I'm looking.

89
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,380
Don't I look amazing?

90
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,020
Hold on.

91
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,280
I could totally debut.

92
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
Can you be quiet for a second?

93
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,890
Hello? We have a problem.

94
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,990
Rena, I think you're wearing that backwards.

95
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh, you're right.

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Pull yourself together. This isn't like you.

97
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,670
Sorry.

98
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,690
I'm heading back out there.

99
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,600
Okay.

100
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,130
Do you know where Mitsuya Yuki is?

101
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,560
No. Probably still in the green room.

102
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,320
The real one.

103
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,050
Greenroom?

104
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,080
May I see your ticket?

105
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,720
Where's the greenroom?

106
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,690
The greenroom isn't open to the public.

107
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm asking you where the greenroom is.

108
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,110
Um, if I could see some ID...

109
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,370
What? You're useless.

110
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,860
She suddenly disappeared.
I can't find her anywhere.

111
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,870
Sometimes girls cancel last minute.

112
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,920
We can't wait any longer, so you're
disqualified due to an absence.

113
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,210
You're on next, Mystery Kiss.

114
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,100
Seriously?

115
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,890
Where have you been?
I was worried about you.

116
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,550
We failed the audition, y'know!

117
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,160
Get out of there. Go somewhere safe.

118
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,530
Not your home. Somewhere around people.

119
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
I'll call you later.

120
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,650
Who is that?

121
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,480
Crap, crap, crap.

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,510
Watch out.

123
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,530
Hey! Whoa!

124
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,430
Rui-tan! Rui-tan!

125
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,820
Thanks for waiting, everyone! Here we go!

126
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,900
Ready, and...

127
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,230
Who the hell are you?

128
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,480
What were you doing there?

129
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,780
Why didn't you audition?

130
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,850
Thanks again, Odokawa-san.

131
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,050
Could you take us
to Shibaura Wharf in a hurry?

132
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,930
Thanks.

133
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,810
By the way, have you considered my request
to hand over your dash cam data?

134
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,810
Yeah, sure.

135
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,760
Really?

136
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,260
I'll sell it to you.

137
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,120
For one billion yen.

138
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,380
That's the kind of price
a child would come up with.

139
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,190
Doesn't this seem like not enough profit?

140
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,970
Is this all we make from concerts?

141
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,320
They weren't the only ones performing today.

142
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,550
Why's she here?

143
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,740
She doesn't want to run
badger games anymore,

144
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,500
so she's here to talk to Yano-san.

145
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,650
He's busy right now.

146
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,540
More importantly, I've got some bad news.

147
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,470
Could I talk to him for a few minutes?

148
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,520
Bad news?

149
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,450
Shiho-chan.

150
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,910
It's about the dash cam.

151
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,480
Is that you, Shiho-chan?

152
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,120
That's not you, is it?

153
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,630
Who are you?

154
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,350
Shiho-chan!

155
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,600
You're being tricked, right?

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,620
I'll protect you from these guys!

157
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,800
I'm actually pretty strong.

158
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,250
I've mastered every martial art there is,
from sumo for kids to whatever-jiujitsu.

159
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,650
Don't get the wrong idea, mister.
Seriously, I can't even.

160
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
Didn't we have fun together?

161
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,820
We ate lots of good food together.

162
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,940
Spending time with you was painful.

163
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,790
That's why I want to quit
running badger games.

164
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,160
You're not the kind of girl who says that!

165
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,620
Shiho-chan, you're a liar!

166
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,330
You're the liar, you bum! You're broke!

167
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,600
Ichimura.

168
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,340
Why?! Why would you say that?!

169
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,330
What, what, what?

170
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,660
I don't believe you! You're lying!

171
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,310
So, what's your bad news?

172
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,360
It's about the dash cam data.

173
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,050
Someone else offered to buy it.

174
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,060
We need to get that dash cam data soon.

175
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,780
I haven't been able to sleep since then.

176
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,380
I keep expecting my doorbell to ring.

177
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,900
Can't you do something about this?!

178
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,150
Quit your whining!

179
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,120
Mystery Kiss is doing great right now!

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,020
They're about to make their major debut!

181
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,830
You guys are doin' pretty good these days?

182
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,630
Then ain't it about time my favor was repaid?

183
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,660
What should we do with him?

184
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,140
What should we do? What should we do?!

185
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,670
You're just like him, too.

186
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,530
Lacking in caution.
Quit asking about our next move.

187
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,480
So, how was Yamamoto?

188
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,380
He seemed flustered.

189
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,300
He wanted to know who was trying to buy it.

190
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,510
Want some?

191
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,850
So, what are you going to do next?

192
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,040
I haven't heard from Kakihana-san in a week.
Do you know where he is?

193
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,700
I'm gonna rob a bank.

194
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,630
What? Sorry, I wasn't listening.

195
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,920
I'm going to rob a bank.

196
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,540
Are you stupid? How, in this day and age?

197
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,440
To be precise, I'm going to rob someone
who's at the bank to make a withdrawal.

198
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,230
I want you to help me.

199
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,590
I told you, I'm not helping you.

200
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,830
Just listen.

201
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,570
It takes a week or two to get
enough cash for a large withdrawal.

202
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,370
They're supposed to contact me
when that happens.

203
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,280
They'll let me know who's receiving
how much cash on what day at what time.

204
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,920
How do you know that?

205
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,590
Lottery tickets can only be redeemed
at an exchange bank.

206
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,880
Anyone who wins a large amount
has to visit that branch,

207
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,630
and I've bribed one of their bank employees.

208
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,170
It's basically like I won the lottery.

209
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,270
That's an awfully roundabout
way of doing things.

210
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,890
Why not just have the bank
employee withdraw the cash?

211
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,040
You don't get it.

212
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,710
That would make the employee a victim.

213
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,820
If I make them an accomplice, then no matter
what happens, it'll work out for me.

214
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,450
As the day of the withdrawal approaches,

215
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,700
guys like me will swarm around
that bank employee.

216
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,490
And we'll beat 'em all and take the cash.

217
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,550
You won't be in any danger.

218
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:46,620
All you have to do is put the cash in
your car once I've taken it to a safe place.

219
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,410
We'll ditch the main car then.

220
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,150
You and I will disappear with the cash.

221
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,330
Don't think about it too hard.

222
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,220
We're asking for donations.

223
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,710
Thank you.

224
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,290
You're drinking again,
aren't you? You gotta quit.

225
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
Thank you.

226
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,330
Children eat for free.

227
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,180
Here.

228
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,890
We're asking for donations, please.

229
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,360
Thank you!

230
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,120
It's warm.

231
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,760
Here.

232
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
I thought I told you not to come here.

233
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,420
Why are you doing this?

234
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,360
They didn't have enough staff.

235
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,850
I'm not talking about the pork broth.

236
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,440
I want to retire and focus on this.

237
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,600
I won't forget everything you've done for me.

238
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,090
You're awfully hasty, aren't you?

239
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:55,000
So, about that dirty-as-sin heaping
pile of cash you can't spend...

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,980
You don't have to put it like that.

241
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,090
The billion yen Dobu-san's got his eye on.

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,170
I already found it.

243
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,690
The police are watching me.
I can't do anything.

244
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,340
That's why this is an opportunity.

245
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,020
I can't let you do this.

246
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,100
I'm gonna bring you some
sparkling clean money.

247
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,560
You idiot!

248
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,560
I'm doing this for the world!
For the people!

249
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,080
I didn't found an NPO just to launder money!

250
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,280
Doesn't matter to me either way.

251
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,800
If you're determined to retire,
then you'll definitely need money.

252
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,640
You need money to help people, too.

253
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,150
So you're gonna steal some
from an honest man?

254
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,960
No, I'm gonna protect an honest citizen.

255
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,640
He's been yapping about it on social media.

256
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,690
Even if we left him alone,
someone worse would prey on him.

257
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,020
I haven't finished cleaning up
your mess, you know.

258
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
There was a time when I thought
about making you an executive.

259
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,700
I must be going senile.

260
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,550
Did you kidnap Don-chan's daughter?

261
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,020
The girl my friend met through a dating site,

262
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,690
and the girl who was with a talent agency
guy named Yamamoto are the same person.

263
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,350
My spring's finally on the horizon, though.

264
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,440
So? Why do I have to be your bodyguard?

265
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,450
You're the one who proposed
I transport a billion yen.

266
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,540
Those are hardly equal.

267
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,690
So, where's your friend?

268
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,750
At the wharf.

269
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,530
Hold on. You don't mean
Yano's place, do you?

270
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,380
If it is, there's nothing I can do.

271
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,170
Isn't Yano your junior?

272
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,680
You're the one obsessed with hierarchies
and pledges made over sake cups.

273
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,930
You should be able to
resolve this by talking.

274
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,720
There's an unspoken rule that we don't
interfere with each other's business.

275
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,440
If I can't save Kakihana,
I'm not helping you rob a bank.

276
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,690
Wouldn't that mean Yano
is interfering with your job?

277
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,050
You think you're so witty, don't you?

278
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,550
Hey.

279
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,320
Well, if it isn't Dobu-san.

280
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,730
What do you think you're doing?

281
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,310
It's cold out here. Let me inside.

282
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,290
Who is he?

283
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,510
A taxi driver.

284
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,030
That's your underling?

285
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,770
You've fallen far, Dobu.

286
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,060
And you're out here runnin' badger games,
so I could say the same of you.

287
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,100
Hey, taxi driver. I'm gonna
chuck this guy into the sea.

288
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,730
Take your friend and get
outta here in the meantime.

289
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

290
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,180
Odokawa...

291
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,160
I get to go home?

292
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,670
Yeah, let's go home.

293
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,930
I'm so pathetic.

294
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,330
And you know what he said?

295
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,160
That I've always been pathetic.

296
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,320
Suddenly, I felt better.

297
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,610
He's my hero.

298
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,030
So, where is this Odokawa person now?

299
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,290
He said he still had something to do.

300
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,800
Kakihana-san, do you know
where you were being held captive?

301
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,970
Not sure. Seemed like
some kind of warehouse.

302
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,880
Did you see any young girls
around Ichimura Shiho's age?

303
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,840
Who was holding you captive?

304
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,250
This big bear of a man wearing glasses.

305
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,380
He was wearing a black track suit.

306
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,530
Do you remember anything else?

307
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,170
Did they say anything?

308
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,460
They were talking about some dash cam data.

309
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,080
They said they really needed
to get their hands on it.

310
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,220
Kakihana-san, should we call the police?

311
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,900
Nah, it's kind of embarrassing.

312
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,690
Besides, I'm tired.

313
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,660
Around 8:30AM on the 24th,

314
00:22:45,180 --> 00:23:00,820
Live

315
00:22:45,180 --> 00:23:00,820
Breaking From Location of Found Body

316
00:22:45,180 --> 00:23:00,820
Abandoned? Police Rush to Identify Body

317
00:22:45,180 --> 00:23:00,820
Minato City, Shibaura Wharf

318
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,000
the body of a woman wrapped in a blue tarp

319
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,290
was found at 3-chome Shibaura
Wharf in Minato City, Tokyo.

320
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,570
The Tokyo Bay Police Station
is working to confirm her identity

321
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,990
while investigating this
as a case of an abandoned body.

322
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,360
I promise I'll catch whoever did it.

323
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:15,870
Next Time

324
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,570
It must be Mitsuya.
Mitsuya's back for revenge.

325
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,110
Bet you wish you were
