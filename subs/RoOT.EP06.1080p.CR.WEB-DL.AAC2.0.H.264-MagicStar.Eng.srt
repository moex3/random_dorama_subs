1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,400
Cut!

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,800
Okay, cut. That was good.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,780
We'll do the parking lot scene next.
We'll resume in 20 minutes.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,870
Also, everyone, Nikaido-sama brought
us some sweet buns. Thank you!

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,650
Thank you!

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,360
You were fantastic, Rui-chan.
That felt really real.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,400
Keep up the good work.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,250
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,240
Thank you, Director.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,990
Sure thing.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,710
You were great.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,050
Why do I have to do this?

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,790
What?

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,740
Hello.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,510
Come on, don't do this now.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,490
You're the one who said you couldn't
make it on singing and dancing alone.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,930
You're gonna get cast in bit parts to start.

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,780
No, I mean why does it have to be this role?

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,000
There weren't any other options.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,100
We couldn't say no after
they made a role just for you.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,500
Well, thank you very much.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,580
What's wrong with you? Don't get so upset.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,710
You're judging that audition tonight.

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,700
Be friendly. I'm counting on you, okay?

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,530
Hello.

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,970
Hello.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,500
Excuse me.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,600
Yes?

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,240
Are you two in Mystery Kiss?

30
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,950
Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,920
This actually isn't the first time.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,790
We've met before.

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,460
Oh, you were at the release event.

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,840
Oh, is that why?

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,260
It's not like we have any other female fans.

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,930
I'm so happy to be
standing onstage with you.

37
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,890
Wow, I'm impressed you
made it to the final ten.

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,560
It's just a coincidence.
How was your audition?

39
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,790
I think there were about a hundred people.

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,770
A hundred?

41
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,940
And the three of you were chosen?

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,070
Yeah. The three of us were chosen.

43
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,290
I guess people who survive
are a different breed.

44
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,410
Right?

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,830
How?

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,780
What?

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,180
They make us wear masks.

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,010
They're only trying to promote Nikaido-san.

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,370
Why?

50
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,670
Why? Because... I don't know.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,630
It's probably the agency's strategy, right?

52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,330
Are you two okay with that?

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,910
Sorry. Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,410
Good morning.

55
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,150
What's wrong?

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,610
What is this? We're all
sharing a greenroom?

57
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,890
We've got a lot of people. We can't help it.

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,300
I want my own room.

59
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,150
But it's full of equipment and costumes.

60
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,760
Then install a partition here. Now.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,850
Hold on.

62
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,070
Hey. Nikaido, hey.

63
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,140
She's got a cute face, but...

64
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,790
Mitsuya-san, what is Nikaido-san like?

65
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,940
Like you just saw.
Strong-willed and hates to lose.

66
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,890
I wish I could talk to her.

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,100
I get it. Not even I feel like
I can casually talk to her.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,580
She's been even more on edge since it was
decided we'd make our major debut.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,080
Mystery Kiss is kind of impressive, though.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,790
You only had five fans to start, right?

71
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,770
Huh?

72
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,660
Oh, yeah. There was a time like that.

73
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,300
It was tough.

74
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,970
Is Mitsuya a stage name?

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,510
Why?

76
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,640
We have this high school junior we haven't
been able to get in touch with recently.

77
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,980
We're looking for her.

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,760
Her name is Mitsuya Yuki.

79
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,790
Hey, Kanon.

80
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,530
What?

81
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,680
What a coincidence.

82
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,030
Is your junior an idol, too?

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,420
I see. You must be worried.

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, so could you let me know
if you know anything?

85
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,750
Sure. I'll let you know
if anything comes up.

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,340
Thanks. Do you mind?

87
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,700
Look. Look at this.

88
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,390
I'm looking, I'm looking.

89
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,380
Don't I look amazing?

90
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,020
Hold on.

91
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,280
I could totally debut.

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,720
Can you be quiet for a second?

93
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,890
Hello? We have a problem.

94
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,990
Rena, I think you're wearing that backwards.

95
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,900
Oh, you're right.

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Pull yourself together. This isn't like you.

97
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,670
Sorry.

98
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,690
I'm heading back out there.

99
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,600
Okay.

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,130
Do you know where Mitsuya Yuki is?

101
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,560
No. Probably still in the green room.

102
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,320
The real one.

103
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,050
Greenroom?

104
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,080
May I see your ticket?

105
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,720
Where's the greenroom?

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,690
The greenroom isn't open to the public.

107
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,900
I'm asking you where the greenroom is.

108
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,110
Um, if I could see some ID...

109
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,370
What? You're useless.

110
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,860
She suddenly disappeared.
I can't find her anywhere.

111
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,870
Sometimes girls cancel last minute.

112
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,920
We can't wait any longer, so you're
disqualified due to an absence.

113
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,210
You're on next, Mystery Kiss.

114
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,100
Seriously?

115
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,890
Where have you been?
I was worried about you.

116
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,550
We failed the audition, y'know!

117
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,160
Get out of there. Go somewhere safe.

118
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,530
Not your home. Somewhere around people.

119
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
I'll call you later.

120
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,650
Who is that?

121
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,480
Crap, crap, crap.

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,510
Watch out.

123
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,530
Hey! Whoa!

124
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,430
Rui-tan! Rui-tan!

125
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,820
Thanks for waiting, everyone! Here we go!

126
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,900
Ready, and...

127
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,230
Who the hell are you?

128
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,480
What were you doing there?

129
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,780
Why didn't you audition?

130
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,850
Thanks again, Odokawa-san.

131
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,050
Could you take us
to Shibaura Wharf in a hurry?

132
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,930
Thanks.

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,810
By the way, have you considered my request
to hand over your dash cam data?

134
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,810
Yeah, sure.

135
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,760
Really?

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,260
I'll sell it to you.

137
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,120
For one billion yen.

138
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,380
That's the kind of price
a child would come up with.

139
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,190
Doesn't this seem like not enough profit?

140
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,970
Is this all we make from concerts?

141
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,320
They weren't the only ones performing today.

142
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,550
Why's she here?

143
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,740
She doesn't want to run
badger games anymore,

144
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,500
so she's here to talk to Yano-san.

145
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,650
He's busy right now.

146
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,540
More importantly, I've got some bad news.

147
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,470
Could I talk to him for a few minutes?

148
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,520
Bad news?

149
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,450
Shiho-chan.

150
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,910
It's about the dash cam.

151
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,480
Is that you, Shiho-chan?

152
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,120
That's not you, is it?

153
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,630
Who are you?

154
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,350
Shiho-chan!

155
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,600
You're being tricked, right?

156
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,620
I'll protect you from these guys!

157
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm actually pretty strong.

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:25,250
I've mastered every martial art there is,
from sumo for kids to whatever-jiujitsu.

159
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,650
Don't get the wrong idea, mister.
Seriously, I can't even.

160
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,660
Didn't we have fun together?

161
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,820
We ate lots of good food together.

162
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,940
Spending time with you was painful.

163
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,790
That's why I want to quit
running badger games.

164
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,160
You're not the kind of girl who says that!

165
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,620
Shiho-chan, you're a liar!

166
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,330
You're the liar, you bum! You're broke!

167
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,600
Ichimura.

168
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,340
Why?! Why would you say that?!

169
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,330
What, what, what?

170
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,660
I don't believe you! You're lying!

171
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,310
So, what's your bad news?

172
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,360
It's about the dash cam data.

173
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,050
Someone else offered to buy it.

174
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,060
We need to get that dash cam data soon.

175
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,780
I haven't been able to sleep since then.

176
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,380
I keep expecting my doorbell to ring.

177
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,900
Can't you do something about this?!

178
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,150
Quit your whining!

179
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,120
Mystery Kiss is doing great right now!

180
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,020
They're about to make their major debut!

181
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,830
You guys are doin' pretty good these days?

182
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,630
Then ain't it about time my favor was repaid?

183
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,660
What should we do with him?

184
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,140
What should we do? What should we do?!

185
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,670
You're just like him, too.

186
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,530
Lacking in caution.
Quit asking about our next move.

187
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,480
So, how was Yamamoto?

188
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,380
He seemed flustered.

189
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,300
He wanted to know who was trying to buy it.

190
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,510
Want some?

191
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,850
So, what are you going to do next?

192
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,040
I haven't heard from Kakihana-san in a week.
Do you know where he is?

193
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,700
I'm gonna rob a bank.

194
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,630
What? Sorry, I wasn't listening.

195
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,920
I'm going to rob a bank.

196
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,540
Are you stupid? How, in this day and age?

197
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,440
To be precise, I'm going to rob someone
who's at the bank to make a withdrawal.

198
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,230
I want you to help me.

199
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,590
I told you, I'm not helping you.

200
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,830
Just listen.

201
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,570
It takes a week or two to get
enough cash for a large withdrawal.

202
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,370
They're supposed to contact me
when that happens.

203
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,280
They'll let me know who's receiving
how much cash on what day at what time.

204
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,920
How do you know that?

205
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,590
Lottery tickets can only be redeemed
at an exchange bank.

206
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,880
Anyone who wins a large amount
has to visit that branch,

207
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,630
and I've bribed one of their bank employees.

208
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,170
It's basically like I won the lottery.

209
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,270
That's an awfully roundabout
way of doing things.

210
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,890
Why not just have the bank
employee withdraw the cash?

211
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,040
You don't get it.

212
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,710
That would make the employee a victim.

213
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,820
If I make them an accomplice, then no matter
what happens, it'll work out for me.

214
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,450
As the day of the withdrawal approaches,

215
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,700
guys like me will swarm around
that bank employee.

216
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,490
And we'll beat 'em all and take the cash.

217
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,550
You won't be in any danger.

218
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:45,620
All you have to do is put the cash in
your car once I've taken it to a safe place.

219
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,410
We'll ditch the main car then.

220
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,150
You and I will disappear with the cash.

221
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,330
Don't think about it too hard.

222
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,220
We're asking for donations.

223
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,710
Thank you.

224
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,290
You're drinking again,
aren't you? You gotta quit.

225
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
Thank you.

226
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,330
Children eat for free.

227
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,180
Here.

228
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,890
We're asking for donations, please.

229
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,360
Thank you!

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,120
It's warm.

231
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,760
Here.

232
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,160
I thought I told you not to come here.

233
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,420
Why are you doing this?

234
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,360
They didn't have enough staff.

235
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,850
I'm not talking about the pork broth.

236
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,440
I want to retire and focus on this.

237
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,600
I won't forget everything you've done for me.

238
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,090
You're awfully hasty, aren't you?

239
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:54,000
So, about that dirty-as-sin heaping
pile of cash you can't spend...

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,980
You don't have to put it like that.

241
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,090
The billion yen Dobu-san's got his eye on.

242
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,170
I already found it.

243
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,690
The police are watching me.
I can't do anything.

244
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,340
That's why this is an opportunity.

245
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,020
I can't let you do this.

246
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm gonna bring you some
sparkling clean money.

247
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,560
You idiot!

248
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm doing this for the world!
For the people!

249
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,080
I didn't found an NPO just to launder money!

250
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,280
Doesn't matter to me either way.

251
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,800
If you're determined to retire,
then you'll definitely need money.

252
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,640
You need money to help people, too.

253
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,150
So you're gonna steal some
from an honest man?

254
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,960
No, I'm gonna protect an honest citizen.

255
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,640
He's been yapping about it on social media.

256
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,690
Even if we left him alone,
someone worse would prey on him.

257
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,020
I haven't finished cleaning up
your mess, you know.

258
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,000
There was a time when I thought
about making you an executive.

259
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,700
I must be going senile.

260
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,550
Did you kidnap Don-chan's daughter?

261
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,020
The girl my friend met through a dating site,

262
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,690
and the girl who was with a talent agency
guy named Yamamoto are the same person.

263
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,350
My spring's finally on the horizon, though.

264
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,440
So? Why do I have to be your bodyguard?

265
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,450
You're the one who proposed
I transport a billion yen.

266
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,540
Those are hardly equal.

267
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,690
So, where's your friend?

268
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,750
At the wharf.

269
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,530
Hold on. You don't mean
Yano's place, do you?

270
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,380
If it is, there's nothing I can do.

271
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,170
Isn't Yano your junior?

272
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,680
You're the one obsessed with hierarchies
and pledges made over sake cups.

273
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,930
You should be able to
resolve this by talking.

274
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,720
There's an unspoken rule that we don't
interfere with each other's business.

275
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,440
If I can't save Kakihana,
I'm not helping you rob a bank.

276
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,690
Wouldn't that mean Yano
is interfering with your job?

277
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,050
You think you're so witty, don't you?

278
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,550
Hey.

279
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
Well, if it isn't Dobu-san.

280
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,730
What do you think you're doing?

281
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,310
It's cold out here. Let me inside.

282
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,290
Who is he?

283
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,510
A taxi driver.

284
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,030
That's your underling?

285
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,770
You've fallen far, Dobu.

286
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,060
And you're out here runnin' badger games,
so I could say the same of you.

287
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:42,100
Hey, taxi driver. I'm gonna
chuck this guy into the sea.

288
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,730
Take your friend and get
outta here in the meantime.

289
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

290
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,180
Odokawa...

291
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,160
I get to go home?

292
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,670
Yeah, let's go home.

293
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,930
I'm so pathetic.

294
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,330
And you know what he said?

295
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,160
That I've always been pathetic.

296
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,320
Suddenly, I felt better.

297
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,610
He's my hero.

298
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,030
So, where is this Odokawa person now?

299
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,290
He said he still had something to do.

300
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,800
Kakihana-san, do you know
where you were being held captive?

301
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,970
Not sure. Seemed like
some kind of warehouse.

302
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,880
Did you see any young girls
around Ichimura Shiho's age?

303
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,840
Who was holding you captive?

304
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,250
This big bear of a man wearing glasses.

305
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,380
He was wearing a black track suit.

306
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,530
Do you remember anything else?

307
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,170
Did they say anything?

308
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,460
They were talking about some dash cam data.

309
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,080
They said they really needed
to get their hands on it.

310
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,220
Kakihana-san, should we call the police?

311
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,900
Nah, it's kind of embarrassing.

312
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,690
Besides, I'm tired.

313
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,660
Around 8:30AM on the 24th,

314
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:59,820
Live

315
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:59,820
Breaking From Location of Found Body

316
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:59,820
Abandoned? Police Rush to Identify Body

317
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:59,820
Minato City, Shibaura Wharf

318
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,000
the body of a woman wrapped in a blue tarp

319
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,290
was found at 3-chome Shibaura
Wharf in Minato City, Tokyo.

320
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,570
The Tokyo Bay Police Station
is working to confirm her identity

321
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,990
while investigating this
as a case of an abandoned body.

322
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,360
I promise I'll catch whoever did it.

323
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:14,870
Next Time

324
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,570
It must be Mitsuya.
Mitsuya's back for revenge.

325
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,110
Bet you wish you were
