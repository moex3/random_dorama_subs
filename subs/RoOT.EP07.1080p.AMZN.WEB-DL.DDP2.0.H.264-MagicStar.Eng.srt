1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,680
We're screwed.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,810
Calm down.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,650
We're still the only ones
who know what happened.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,820
We'll be fine.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,440
You call this fine?
Then why are the cops here?

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,700
It must be Mitsuya.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,130
Mitsuya's back for revenge.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,390
Keep your voice down.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,010
I should've reported it then.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,250
Nikaido.

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,530
Hello, Mitsuya-san?

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,810
Why didn't you audition the other day?

13
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,450
I was looking forward to your performance.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,680
I suddenly felt ill. Maybe I was nervous.

15
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,560
I actually wanted your advice on something.

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,410
My advice?

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,490
My manager told me to go
make some money tonight.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,010
He said Ichimura-san's doing it, too.

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,050
What do you mean?

20
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,950
Apparently she gets paid
to eat with old men.

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,190
Does your agency make you do
that kind of thing?

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm not with an agency, but if mine
told me to do that, I'd quit right away.

23
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,150
Right? After all, I joined
this agency to become an idol.

24
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,980
Yeah. No one wants to do that.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,370
It's weird, though. Nikaido-san's
the only who doesn't have to do it.

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,680
Anyway, what happened with
your junior you mentioned after that?

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,390
Not much.

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,850
I told Nikaido-san about her.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,300
What?

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,050
Her reaction was obviously strange.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,280
Strange how?

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,580
I guess you could say she seemed flustered.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,800
In any case, it was weird.

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,950
Weird?

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,770
And lately our agency's
been acting weird, too.

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,780
They told us not to talk to anyone.

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,710
Why are you telling me this?

38
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,760
I just came to Tokyo.
I don't have anyone to turn to.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,810
I see. That must be disheartening.

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,370
What do you do for work, Rena-chan?
You're not part of an agency, right?

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm working another job right now.
Part-time at a cabaret club.

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,410
Huh. Really?

43
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,090
Around 8:30AM on the 24th, the body
of a woman wrapped in a tarp

44
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,070
was found at Shibaura Wharf
in Tokyo's Minato City, Kaigan 3-chome.

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,560
The Tokyo Bay Police Station
is working to confirm her identity

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,930
while investigating this
as a case of an abandoned body.

47
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,610
The body was discovered near
the Shibaura Wharf station, and—

48
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,090
...while investigating this
as a case of an abandoned body.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,590
The body was discovered near
the Shibaura Wharf station,

50
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,590
and the area was temporarily in an uproar.

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,590
Rena-san.

52
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,380
Mitsuya-san called me this morning.

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,390
What? Mitsuya? Wait, what?

54
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,390
Of Mystery Kiss.

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,920
Oh, right.

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,520
She said Nikaido-san and
her agency were acting weird.

57
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,790
Sounds like they're starting to slip up.

58
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,150
Yuki had all those incoming
calls from Nikaido Rui.

59
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,110
Yeah.

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,740
I want to see the pictures you
took on your first day of work.

61
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,490
Dobu has those.
There's no way to get them now.

62
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,680
Who wants those pictures?

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,590
We do.

64
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,220
No, the guy who cheated.
And what does he do for work?

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,340
Niji Bank Staff Entrance

66
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,340
Nijiiro Bank

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,690
What?

68
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,610
Please return my laptop
with the affair photos already.

69
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,930
You're one persistent bastard, aren't you?

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,410
Your laptop broke.

71
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,340
What?

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,620
Just kidding.

73
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,410
I don't have time for that right now.

74
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,120
Again.

75
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,740
I'll blow up your phone.

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,390
You're a real pain in the ass.

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm done with that laptop.

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,830
I'll return it to the banker later.

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,010
You can negotiate with him.

80
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,230
Return it? But it's my—
I mean, my company's laptop.

81
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,030
And later? When and where is that?

82
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,900
Shut up. I'm busy!

83
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,210
I'll kill you!

84
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,900
What? Hey, wait! Dobu-san—

85
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,320
You suck at this. See?

86
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,800
Do you mind?

87
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,210
Congratulations on winning the lottery.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,440
Congratulations.

89
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,010
Niji Bank

90
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,970
Good work.

91
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,910
You did well. Now hurry up.

92
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,430
I was worried they'd check
the fake notes. Right?

93
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,790
Are we going to be all right? They're not
going to retaliate later, are they?

94
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,990
You'll be fine. Once they lose the
contest, they'll leave this town.

95
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,860
Now, hurry up.

96
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,590
Got it.

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,200
Um, what about the pictures?

98
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,220
You'll get paid once I check the contents.

99
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,780
I'll send you the location later.

100
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,210
Okay.

101
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,500
Looks like it went well.

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,890
For now, yeah.

103
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,360
Wow.

104
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,550
Bet you wish you were
getting a cut now, huh?

105
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,700
No, I don't need that. But you're
 gonna pay your taxi fare.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,750
Niji Bank

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Hey, Sato! Sato!

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
Rena-san.

109
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,310
What'd they say?

110
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,610
That banker just left.

111
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,630
Really? Then—

112
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,960
Then he can't have gone far.

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,390
Hey, wait!

114
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,940
Excuse me. Excuse me.

115
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,860
Excuse me.

116
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,130
Sorry. Wrong person.

117
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,580
Hello? I'll be right there.

118
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,890
The tire... the tire...

119
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Hey, what are you doing?!

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,030
Who are you?! The police?!

121
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,000
We don't care about your affair!
Someone might've been killed!

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,820
Be grateful your wife
won't find out you're cheating!

123
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,880
What? She won't? Really?!

124
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,290
That depends on you.

125
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,620
What? Who are you guys?

126
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,400
I don't understand.

127
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,720
The suspect in another case might be
in the photographic evidence of your affair.

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,830
What does that have to do with me?

129
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,280
How do you weigh a person's life,
an affair, and one billion yen

130
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,980
against each other on your scales?

131
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,010
What? But you can't weigh three things
against each other on a pair of scales.

132
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,440
This guy's joking around.

133
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm being serious.

134
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,100
You think you're worth that much, huh?!

135
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,260
Don't get the wrong idea!

136
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,830
I'm not getting paid one billion yen.

137
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,590
I'm sure they'll get arrested, anyway.

138
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,280
So will you for doing this.

139
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,110
Did you just come here to threaten me?

140
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,160
You're just like Dobu.

141
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,050
Just like Dobu?! We're not like Dobu!

142
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,180
Maybe we are.

143
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,270
In the end, maybe
we all commit a little evil.

144
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,690
But you regret your actions. So do I.

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,630
And trying to make up for it
can't be a bad thing.

146
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,070
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,540
It's on! Nice.

148
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,450
This is it! Found it. I found it.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,850
Wait, wait, wait.

150
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,880
Nikaido Rui.

151
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,490
I knew she came to the office
the night of the incident.

152
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,420
Where was Mitsuya Yuki-san at this time?

153
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,490
Based on her call history, Nikaido invited
her to the agency, so she was there, too?

154
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,330
She saw something here and
got caught up in some trouble.

155
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,670
Which means Odokawa gave Yuki-san a ride
and dropped her off at the office?

156
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm going to go see Nikaido.

157
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,930
I'm going to go talk to Odokawa.

158
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,870
Studio

159
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,320
Do you need something?

160
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,130
You're that girl from the other day.

161
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm here about Yuki—Mitsuya Yuki.

162
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,170
Where is she now?

163
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,680
She just left.

164
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,060
I'm talking about the real Mitsuya Yuki.

165
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,180
The real Yuki?

166
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,050
I don't know. She suddenly disappeared.

167
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,900
Our manager doesn't know what to do,
so he replaced her with another girl.

168
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,800
Didn't her mother submit
a missing persons report?

169
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,600
She rescinded it right away.

170
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,820
I heard she contacted them.

171
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,710
Oh, yeah?

172
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,990
She asked them not to look for her.

173
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,860
Maybe she realized her father
had yakuza connections.

174
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,840
She couldn't have kept working
as an idol after that.

175
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,080
You think her dad would've accepted that?

176
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,800
I don't know. But it's her father who feels
guilty about what he's done, right?

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
He hasn't.

178
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,410
What?

179
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,520
He hasn't accepted it, so he hired
a detective to find his daughter,

180
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,840
but she's still missing.

181
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,150
You're a detective, aren't you?

182
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,030
Formerly. Not anymore.

183
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,520
Then why are you doing this?

184
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,120
Because she was my junior in high school.

185
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,660
That's all?

186
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,080
How can you be so calm
when someone is missing?

187
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,280
She might've gotten caught up in a crime.

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,770
Fine. I'll cooperate.

189
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,930
I'm already cooperating with the police.

190
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,900
So, what?

191
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,570
Plenty of girls go missing
due to poor mental health.

192
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,120
If anything, it's weird that
you're so fired up about it

193
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,190
just because you went
to the same high school.

194
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,220
She's holding me back and
causing huge problems for me.

195
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,660
All kinds of people are under
suspicion because of this.

196
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,890
Uh-huh. Well, you go on
holding other people back.

197
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,520
I used to be the same way.

198
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,410
I understand what it's like to
wish someone would just go away.

199
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,880
She could do everything, including track.

200
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,740
Not only was I less talented than her,
but she even worked hard in secret.

201
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,970
Watching Yuki threw my own
failures back in my face.

202
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,460
How would you know how I feel?

203
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,730
On the night of October 4th,
you were at Mystery Kiss' agency office.

204
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,440
What proof do you have?

205
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,650
The last call Yuki received was from you.

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,430
Also, I have this photo.

207
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,910
Okay? So what if I was at my own agency?

208
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,860
You came up with some pretext

209
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,430
to invite Mitsuya Yuki to the agency
in the middle of the night.

210
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,550
And?

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,330
You killed her.

212
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,530
That's a huge leap. Are you stupid?

213
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,970
Besides, it's not that easy to kill someone.

214
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,000
No, it must've been on impulse.

215
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,100
You suspected your agency was
backed by someone shady, didn't you?

216
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,920
The yakuza disposed of the body.
That's why Yuki hasn't been found.

217
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,710
If you were truly smart and calm,
you wouldn't have killed her.

218
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,490
And if you were smarter and calmer,
then you wouldn't have done this.

219
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,160
This pretending to be a detective
or pretending to be an idol.

220
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,180
Damn it. That bastard.

221
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,870
Take me to a doctor, Odokawa.

222
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,480
There's an unlicensed doctor
I'm well-acquainted with.

223
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,950
Hurry up. Put me in your taxi.

224
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,250
You should go to a normal hospital.
Receive proper treatment.

225
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,680
Wait. The car. What are you
going to do with it?

226
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,420
I'm going to return the money to its owner.

227
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,710
It finally caught up to you.

228
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,530
This is what they call retribution.

229
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,950
This is goodbye for you and me.

230
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,470
Don't screw with me, Odokawa.

231
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,200
Hey! Dobu-san, hang in there! Hey!

232
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,610
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,300
Why'd you have to go and get shot?

234
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,800
A lot of people have it out for me.

235
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,690
This is what they call retribution.

236
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,900
Did Odokawa do this to you?

237
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:12,080
He's just a taxi driver who
gave a passenger a ride.

238
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,630
Hurry up and call the cops.

239
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,900
Otherwise, there's no telling
what Yano will do to him.

240
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,380
Huh? What?

241
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,030
No. Stay with me!

242
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,650
Hey! Hey, Dobu-san! Dobu-san!

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Nice shot.

244
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,210
You're on the green.

245
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,240
Nice one.

246
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,220
Nice.

247
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,890
Excuse me.

248
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,860
Right.

249
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,470
Huh? Are you okay?

250
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,400
What happened? Hey.

251
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,380
Before dawn on the 25th, three male
members of an anti-social organization

252
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,200
nearly stole roughly one billion yen
in lottery winnings.

253
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,590
Representative Kuroda Shigeru was transported
by emergency services to the hospital,

254
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,020
This morning before dawn,
the police arrested a 27-year-old

255
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,620
where he is receiving treatment for...

256
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,770
and 33-year-old unemployed man
fleeing from the scene of the crime.

257
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,310
According to the MPD, suspect Kyohei
was shot with a firearm in a parking lot.

258
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,970
Illegally acquired funds were
being supplied to the NPO...

259
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:23,290
Due to severe blood loss, a 39-year-old man
thought be to connected to the same case...

260
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,920
The police have been waiting
for Kuroda to recover to...

261
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,950
Until now, he's supported
over 5,000 children

262
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,750
orphaned by traffic accidents
or without living relatives...

263
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,710
In the case of the unidentified body
found near Shibaura Wharf,

264
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,400
the MPD is investigating a connection
 to the missing Nerima high school girl

265
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,230
due to similarities
in appearance and clothes—

266
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,110
Well?

267
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,180
The day she disappeared,
Yuki-san received a bunch of calls

268
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,360
from another girl in her group
in the middle of the night.

269
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,280
That's right. She said her friend
invited her out before she left.

270
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,850
Where was she invited to?

271
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,190
I don't know.

272
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,210
That girl is the leader
of the group Yuki was in.

273
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,890
I see.

274
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,840
Yes.

275
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,600
And that night, that leader...
Nikaido entered the agency's office.

276
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,610
This is Nikaido Rui. Do you recognize her?

277
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,480
Did Yuki do something
to make this girl hate her?

278
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,790
Even if she did, what happened
to her is unforgivable.

279
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,890
I promise I'll catch whoever did it.

280
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,850
Why are you doing all this for my daughter?

281
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,840
A man named Yano has been telling me
to keep quiet about this.

282
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,830
"Don't look for your daughter. If you tell
the police, I'll expose your husband's past."

283
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,390
At first, he promised
to tell me where Yuki was

284
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,190
if I rescinded the missing person's report.

285
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,950
Yano?

286
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,020
A potential executive
of a criminal organization.

287
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,000
Why didn't he want you to talk?

288
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,130
My husband Donraku was
going to be named a tomena.

289
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,130
Tomena?

290
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,910
Rena-san, you don't know what that is?

291
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,100
It means no one else will take his name.

292
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,410
It's the highest rank someone can achieve.

293
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,280
Yuki was overjoyed by the news, too.

294
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,730
So at first, we thought Yuki ran away

295
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,140
because she was shocked
to learn about Donraku's past.

296
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,350
Did Yano tell you that?

297
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,440
Was there anything else
unusual about that day?

298
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,180
It was the same as always.

299
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,980
On weekdays, she came home
around eight at night.

300
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,450
Donraku was home for once, so
the three of us had dinner at home.

301
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,640
We talked about trivial things,

302
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,830
like the trouble Yuki caused when
she was little by bringing frogs home.

303
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,170
Hello?

304
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,950
I'll be right there.

305
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,940
Huh? Ma'am?

306
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,100
The body found at Shibaura Wharf
has been identified.

307
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,320
The deceased is Nerima City resident
Mitsuya Yuki-san,18 years old.

308
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,740
I'm sorry for all the trouble we've caused.

309
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,790
Nikaido Rui

310
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,790
Yamamoto Fuyuki

311
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,790
Sergio Takagi

312
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,790
We've been unable to conceal our shock

313
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,920
Ichimura

314
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,050
since we learned that
Yuki Mitsuya was found dead.

315
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,340
Nikaido Rui

316
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,260
Nikaido Rui

317
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,260
Yamamoto Fuyuki

318
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,260
Sergio Takagi

319
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,130
In October, Mitsuya Yuki's
mother contacted us

320
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,870
to tell us that her daughter
hadn't returned home.

321
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,560
Nikaido Rui

322
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,440
We did everything we could to help look
for her, but failed to locate her.

323
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,310
Ichim

324
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,270
Then who's this Mitsuya Yuki
sitting up there?

325
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,730
Nikaido Rui

326
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,730
Yamamoto Fuyuki

327
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,730
Sergio Takagi

328
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,090
We had another girl stand in for
Mitsuya Yuki so the group could debut.

329
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,570
I've heard the police are
investigating this case as a murder.

330
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,450
Do you have any idea what happened to her?

331
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:29,140
Well, she was underpaid
before the group debuted.

332
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,170
I believe she promoted herself
on social media

333
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,290
and may have been close with fans as well.

334
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,060
You mean she was killed by a fan?

335
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,970
No, I'm just saying that's a possibility.

336
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:47,660
We take responsibility for failing to protect
her privacy and provide adequate security.

337
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,520
We cannot regret what happened
more than we already do.

338
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,110
We also can't bear to face
 Shofutei Donraku-san

339
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,630
who entrusted his daughter to our agency.

340
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,950
Has Donraku-san said anything about this?

341
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,090
How do the other members feel?

342
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,410
Does Donraku-san know
Mitsuya Yuki was replaced?

343
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,540
The body found at Shibaura Wharf
has been identified.

344
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,880
Mystery Kiss Member
Mitsuya Yuki-san (18 years old)

345
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,430
The deceased is Nerima City resident
 Mitsuya Yuki-san, 18 years old.

346
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,550
Mitsuya Yuki-san was a member
of idol group Mystery Kiss.

347
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,250
I'm so sorry. Donraku
is currently out right now.

348
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,800
Fans have been shocked by
the sudden news of her death.

349
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,140
Could I please ask you to
leave for today? Excuse me.

350
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,610
Donraku-san! Donraku-san!
Could we get a comment?

351
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,770
Honestly...

352
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,230
Honestly, I know
I'm an irresponsible parent.

353
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,100
But honestly, I wish I could kill her killer.

354
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Is this related to your
past criminal associations?

355
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,530
Will this affect your tomena naming?

356
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,000
Is that all you have to say
when your daughter was killed?

357
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,830
None of your damn business, you bastards!

358
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,140
What the hell are you doing?!

359
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,030
Go on! Get out of here, bastards!

360
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,930
Rena-san, everyone's worried about you.

361
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,070
We brought you those
salmon roe rice balls you like.

362
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,020
Are you okay?

363
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,860
Rena-chan.

364
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,200
Excuse us.

365
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
Sorry the place is a mess.

366
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,150
It's fine.

367
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,190
I'm glad you're okay, but...

368
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,250
It's dark in here.

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,670
Give us a second.

370
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,020
Have some.

371
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,700
That's good.

372
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,530
Yeah?

373
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,190
So, Rena-san, when are you
coming back to work?

374
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,040
Don't ask her that right now.

375
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,200
But if the boss were here...

376
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,910
Yeah.

377
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,680
We'd be like a family, you know?

378
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,620
What does that mean? Oh, please.

379
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,220
Imagine the boss were here.
The four of us would be a family.

380
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
I guess that's not so bad.

381
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,710
Is it good?

382
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,860
It's so good. What's with this salmon roe?

383
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,540
Yuki's working hard, too.
I couldn't say that to her.

384
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:15,910
Next Time

385
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,890
What? Yuki? Are you okay?!

386
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,670
Hey! Are you okay?

387
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,740
Please.

388
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,790
I don't want anything to do
with this stuff anymore.

389
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,030
I really didn't do it!

390
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,530
Mitsuya called me.

391
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,620
What? What is this?

392
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,060
We're doing this without
the higher ups' knowledge.

393
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,860
This show is a work of fiction.

394
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,360
We're screwed if they find out.
