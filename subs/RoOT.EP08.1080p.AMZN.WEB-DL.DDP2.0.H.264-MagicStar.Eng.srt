1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,490
I heard they're only having
one person compete in the long jump.

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,820
What? Then it's gotta be Rena-senpai.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,630
She's been practicing every morning lately.

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,080
No, it could be Yuki. Have you
 seen her recent numbers?

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,880
But she's still a first-year.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,100
Let's go.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,170
Gather round, track team!

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,070
We've chosen our lineup, so take a look.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,140
This next meet will be the third-years' last.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,630
Even if you're not competing, make sure
you cheer on the rest of the team.

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,770
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,840
What? Why? We're both
signed up for the relay.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,270
Are we supposed to start
practicing our baton pass now?

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,910
Running Long Jump
 Year 2 Year 1 Mitsuya Yuki

15
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,940
But I'm not a team player.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,280
Wait, are all the third-years signed up?

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,620
What's wrong, Rena?

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,080
I can't accept it.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,580
Didn't you talk to the teacher?

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,170
She said I was disrupting the team's harmony.

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,270
Wow, that's awful.

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,720
All you're doing is focusing on your own
training since we have a meet coming up.

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,760
She refused to listen
to anything I had to say.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,040
I have to do well.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,500
You mean for college?

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,640
Exemptions from school fees can be huge.

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,080
Why don't you try talking to Yuki?

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,970
Yuki's training hard, too.
I couldn't say that to her.

29
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,690
I know. I know. Yes. Yes.

30
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,020
Supernatural Love
Phenomenon

31
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,560
Countless times. Yes.

32
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,670
O-One moment, please! Yes.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,690
Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes.

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,310
I'm sorry. Seems like
we've got a poor signal.

35
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,850
Oh, give me a break. Are you done?

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,730
Can you hear me? Huh? Hello? Hello?

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,310
Okay, bye. Bye. Yes. Yes.

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Thank you.

39
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,460
Do we have a poor signal?

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,350
Good afternoon, everyone.

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,520
Here you go. Here. Here.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,460
What is this?

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,640
I put together a concert set list.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,310
You can't expect us to sing
under these circumstances.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,610
Why aren't you stopping this?

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,160
Please. Tickets are selling like crazy.

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,900
But...

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,190
Could you two leave us for a second?

49
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,010
This can't be good.

50
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,970
I finally learned the
choreography and song, too.

51
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,030
They said we'd only be wearing masks
until Mitsuya-san came back, anyway.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,460
I've been thinking, why don't we
start over at another agency?

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,830
I don't want anything to do
with this stuff anymore.

54
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,980
I know. Let's talk downstairs.

55
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,140
Those girls we met the other day...

56
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,280
I trusted you then.

57
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,040
I knew it. That's why you
couldn't call the police.

58
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,740
Who else is there?

59
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,600
How would I know?

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
You're the one who said it.

61
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,470
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,060
Maybe I said I wish they were dead,
but that was just a slip of the tongue.

63
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,760
I really didn't do it!

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,010
I know that. You have no reason
to lie to me, Nikaido.

65
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,300
Could you stop looking at me like that?
Like you know everything about me.

66
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,400
Why did you show up then, anyway?

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,320
Mitsuya called me.

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,050
Hello?

69
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,470
Oh, hello.

70
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,810
Why are you calling so late?

71
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,280
Nikaido-san asked me to come to the office.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,890
I'm scared.

73
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,980
Nikaido did?

74
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,710
Yeah. I hope I'm just overthinking it.

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,910
Could you come, too, Yamamoto-san?

76
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,650
Where are you now?

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,300
I'm on my way there in a taxi.
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,980
Fine. I'll be right there.

79
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,790
Huh? Why are you sitting in the dark?

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,950
Don't scare me like that, Nikaido.

81
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,930
What?

82
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,650
What is it? What's wrong?

83
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,720
Huh? Mitsuya?

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,640
What is this?

85
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,130
What did you...

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,040
Wait, wait, wait! How could you do this now?!

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,500
We're screwed if people find out about this.

88
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,840
Let me think for a second.

89
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,230
Okay, we're good. We're all good.

90
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,220
I know someone who will do anything
for the right price. No, wait...

91
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,900
Did anyone see you come here?
Did you take the train?

92
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,730
Damn it! I shouldn't have taken a taxi.

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,040
I walked.

94
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,850
We need to hire a professional.

95
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,520
It's okay.

96
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,540
Yano-san, what should we do?

97
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't give up, man.

98
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,170
I seriously can't with this.

99
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:09,700
Looks like she was bludgeoned
by a pissed off Nikaido,

100
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,660
then strangled by Yamamoto.

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,380
"Never murder no matter how fat
the stacks" is the boss' roots.

102
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,200
Now it's my rule.

103
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,920
But you played fast and loose,
now you went and screwed the pooch.

104
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,630
To me, that's how it looks.

105
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,570
Hey, you. Spread that tarp over there.

106
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,350
Come on.

107
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,850
We're gonna move her. Hurry up.

108
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,810
Okay.

109
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Hey.

110
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,170
Hurry, hurry.

111
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,570
Um, where are we going?

112
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,820
Out to sea, then towards Kawasaki.

113
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,210
Land routes are too dangerous.

114
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,940
What? We're going to toss her into the sea?

115
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,780
She'd come floating back
up right away, idiot.

116
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
We're gonna melt her.

117
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,470
Wouldn't that construction site
be a better place to hide her?

118
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,180
That's our last resort.

119
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,400
Last resort?

120
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,220
No one ever resorts to using a last resort.

121
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,850
That land belongs to the group, idiot.

122
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,680
We're doing this without
the higher ups' knowledge.

123
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,260
We're screwed if they find out.

124
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,450
Hurry up or the sun will come up.

125
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,950
Push that side. We'll dump her.

126
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,540
Let's dump her.

127
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,890
Are you okay?

128
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,130
Unbelievable. Yano-san,
could you handle the engine?

129
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,940
What?

130
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,120
Hey!

131
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,460
You idiots! What are you doing?!

132
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,350
Hey, Nikaido, um...

133
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,240
Hello.

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,210
What? Yuki?

135
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,310
Yuki! Are you okay?!

136
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,180
Hey! Are you okay?

137
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,880
Someone get a teacher!

138
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,390
Got it!

139
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,350
Yuki? What's wrong?

140
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,440
It's Yuki!

141
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,300
This is bad.

142
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,390
Are you okay? Yuki? Yuki?

143
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,550
Are you okay? Yuki!

144
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,080
Yes?

145
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,850
You came to see me?

146
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,500
Yeah.

147
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,090
Yuki-chan, we're gonna go.

148
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,590
Okay.

149
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,990
We'll visit again before you move.

150
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,250
Thanks. Bye. Thanks.

151
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,440
See you later.

152
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,030
Bye.

153
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,250
Take care.

154
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,560
It's good to see you again.

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,870
Good to see you.

156
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,140
I'm amazed she showed her face here.

157
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,710
Right? Talk about shameless.

158
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,590
Yuki, you're moving?

159
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,250
Yeah. I'm transferring schools.

160
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,320
What?

161
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,990
It's not your fault, Rena-san.

162
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,110
I was always planning to move in
with my father who lives in Tokyo.

163
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,890
I see. So, how are you doing?

164
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,360
A lot better. See?

165
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,120
Rena-san, I heard you were suspended.

166
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,070
I'm sorry that happened because of me.

167
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,770
No, uh...

168
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,710
Tokyo, huh? Lucky. I'd love to go hang out.

169
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,840
Kanon-san, you're thinking
of Harajuku, aren't you?

170
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,720
My father's house is in Nerima.

171
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,530
It's not that different from here.

172
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,020
No way! When are you moving?

173
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,120
As soon as I'm out of the hospital.

174
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,290
I see.

175
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,100
Hey, Rena. Yuki said she wanted to see you.

176
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,470
What?

177
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,200
I thought we'd regret not seeing
each other before we parted ways.

178
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,280
Right?

179
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,450
I still like you, Rena-san, so...

180
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,150
Wait, what about me?

181
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,310
Kanon-san, you'll forget
about me before long.

182
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,740
How could you? You know that's not true.

183
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,830
Let's hang out in Tokyo
together sometime, okay?

184
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,880
Agreed!

185
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,680
Right, Rena?

186
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,090
Oh, right. That keychain.

187
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,520
Thank you. I'll treasure it.

188
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,310
It's so cute.

189
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,240
Rena-san? I hope you're not crying.

190
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,370
It'll make it harder to see you again.

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,610
Thank you.

192
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,300
Thank you.

193
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,970
Rena-chan, thank you so much
for coming today.

194
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,550
We were just going to invite family, but
we wanted to make an exception for you.

195
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,210
I'm sure Yuki is happy, too.

196
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,590
Thank you for all that you've done.

197
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,550
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything to help.

198
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,150
That's not true at all. You kept
searching for her until the end.

199
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,320
Are you two all right?

200
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,030
Yeah.

201
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,930
I'm relieved Yuki finally came back to us.

202
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,530
Right.

203
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,310
Rena-chan, you can come talk
to us anytime you're hurting.

204
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:56,970
Um, I did a terrible thing to Yuki-san.

205
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,580
What do you mean?

206
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm the one who injured her
on the stairs in high school.

207
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,360
That's in the past.

208
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,410
I liked Yuki.

209
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,700
She was so brilliant, it frustrated me.

210
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:46,050
I still don't understand what
I did then or why I did it.

211
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,180
It eats away at me so much
I don't know what to do.

212
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,950
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,880
Yes! I hope you'll come!

214
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,520
I'll pick you up. Okay, thank you!

215
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,460
Excuse me.

216
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,950
Yamamoto-san.

217
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,220
Um, Nikaido-san.

218
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,240
You know why we're here, don't you?

219
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,840
You're under arrest for the murder
of Mitsuya Yuki on December 24th

220
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,860
and abandoning her body.

221
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,550
What? Wait, what do you mean?

222
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,310
On the 30th, police arrested Mystery Kiss
member and suspect Nikaido Rui

223
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,700
who was voluntarily undergoing
questioning for the murder

224
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,730
of fellow group member Mitsuya
Yuki-san and abandoning her body.

225
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,770
The suspect is denying some of the charges.

226
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Suspect Yamamoto

227
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Group manager, suspected of abandoning and
mutilating a corpse with suspect Nikaido Rui

228
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,160
The police have also arrested the group's
 manager Yamamoto Fuyuki,

229
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:33,340
What?

230
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:33,340
Suspected of Murdering Idol

231
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:33,340
Fellow Group Member Arrested

232
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,830
Suspect Yano Haruhito (27)

233
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,830
Arrested & detained for one billion yen robbery → Rearrested
Under investigation for involvement in criminal organization

234
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,830
and rearrested self-proclaimed company
managers Yano Haruhito and Sekiguchi Togo,

235
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,060
who were previously arrested and
detained on separate robbery charges,

236
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,340
Suspect Sekiguchi Togo (33)

237
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,340
Arrested & detained for one billion yen robbery → Rearrested
Under investigation for involvement in criminal organization

238
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,340
this time for abandoning
 and mutilating a corpse.

239
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,890
I'd like to try disguising myself.

240
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,510
Sure, do it. What?

241
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,650
Hello.

242
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,600
Hello. Feels like it's been a while, huh?

243
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,540
You should've let me know you were coming.

244
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,930
Sorry. The Yuki stuff has calmed down
for now, so I came to tidy up.

245
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,680
What about the future? Have you
already decided what you're going to do?

246
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,460
Not really.

247
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,350
Don't be so secretive.

248
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,950
I've been learning on the job
for a while now,

249
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,490
so I figured I'd do some
classroom learning for a while.

250
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,100
What classroom learning?

251
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,840
You're going to college?

252
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,430
I'll start by getting my
secondary school certificate.

253
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,940
Then I'll study the law properly.

254
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,060
What about an online program?

255
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,790
Then you can keep working while you study.

256
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,260
That's what my second cousin's
husband's sister's friend did,

257
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,860
and she makes tons of money now.

258
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,610
Why don't you do that while
you come back to work for us?

259
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,490
Finding a new investigator would be
a lot of work. Right, boss?

260
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,460
What are you talking about? We've got me.

261
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,780
Who, you? Where?

262
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
According to their investigation,

263
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,870
Hey! I'm already right here, aren't I?

264
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,040
police found signs that Mitsuya-san
was struck on the head with a blunt object

265
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,420
You just joined recently.

266
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,760
and strangled with something like a cable.

267
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,330
Also, there was no weapon
found at the crime scene.

268
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,640
Based on the method used,

269
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,120
the police believe the culprit held
a strong grudge against Mitsuya-san

270
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,230
and are currently
questioning multiple people

271
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,730
who may have had interpersonal
issues with the victim.

272
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,810
What happened to you today?

273
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,350
Sorry for suddenly asking to meet.

274
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,880
It's totally fine. It's not like
I have anything else to do.

275
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,920
Everyone's been arrested.
My schedule's wide open.

276
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,750
Thank you for waiting.

277
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,100
Wait, really?

278
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,450
You have my support.

279
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,500
This is so awkward.

280
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,680
Now I'm famous for something weird.
Did you see the news?

281
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,760
Yeah. Sorry I didn't notice.

282
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,960
It's fine. Now I don't have to wear a mask.

283
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,430
I figured out a bunch of things
because you called me the other day.

284
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,320
I wanted to thank you for that today.

285
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,780
Really? You mean about Nikaido-san?

286
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,570
Yeah. It made me realize there are
unimaginably scary things out there.

287
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,680
Wadagaki-san, what are you going to do?

288
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,240
I've actually been recruited
by another agency.

289
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,960
Another agency? You're going
to keep being an idol?

290
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,180
I can't let that bring me down.
It's the reason I came to Tokyo.

291
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,670
I can't go home until
I've accomplished something.

292
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,010
Right.

293
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,270
Besides, I haven't been paid yet.

294
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,270
I can't even get in touch
with the company president.

295
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,060
I've gotten caught in the crossfire.

296
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,270
Crossfire?

297
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,730
Huh?

298
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,290
Come to think of it,

299
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,790
you and Ichimura-san must've been asked
what you were doing the day of the incident.

300
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,760
Yeah. This again?

301
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,530
The police asked me too,
but it was a normal day for me.

302
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,260
I went to my dance lesson,
and then I went home.

303
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
Why do you ask?

304
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,210
Your dance lesson, huh?
What about Ichimura-san?

305
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,470
I don't know. Probably
doing her sugar daddy job.

306
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,190
Maybe that was the reason.

307
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,170
What caused Nikaido-san
and Mitsuya-san's disagreement?

308
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,480
Nikaido-san had a harsh personality.

309
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,650
Is that a reason to do that?

310
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,940
What's gotten into you?
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

311
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,020
Do you?

312
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:29,390
I'm trying to move onto
my next step, so could you not?

313
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,300
You're right.

314
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,590
Wadagaki-san?

315
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,340
Wadagaki-san?

316
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,630
Sato?

317
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,620
She just left. Be careful.

318
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,280
I thought if I became an idol
I'd be able to meet my dad.

319
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:16,000
Next Time

320
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,180
My dad is a storyteller.
His name is Donraku.

321
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,860
If you're so unmotivated,
why don't you just quit?

322
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,520
