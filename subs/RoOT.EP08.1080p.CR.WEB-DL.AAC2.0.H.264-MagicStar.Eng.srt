1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,490
I heard they're only having
one person compete in the long jump.

2
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,820
What? Then it's gotta be Rena-senpai.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,630
She's been practicing every morning lately.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,080
No, it could be Yuki. Have you
 seen her recent numbers?

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
But she's still a first-year.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,100
Let's go.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,170
Gather round, track team!

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,070
We've chosen our lineup, so take a look.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,140
This next meet will be the third-years' last.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,630
Even if you're not competing, make sure
you cheer on the rest of the team.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,770
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,840
What? Why? We're both
signed up for the relay.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,270
Are we supposed to start
practicing our baton pass now?

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,910
Running Long Jump
 Year 2 Year 1 Mitsuya Yuki

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,940
But I'm not a team player.

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,280
Wait, are all the third-years signed up?

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,620
What's wrong, Rena?

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,080
I can't accept it.

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,580
Didn't you talk to the teacher?

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,170
She said I was disrupting the team's harmony.

21
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,270
Wow, that's awful.

22
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,720
All you're doing is focusing on your own
training since we have a meet coming up.

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,760
She refused to listen
to anything I had to say.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
I have to do well.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,500
You mean for college?

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,640
Exemptions from school fees can be huge.

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,080
Why don't you try talking to Yuki?

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,970
Yuki's training hard, too.
I couldn't say that to her.

29
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,690
I know. I know. Yes. Yes.

30
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,020
Supernatural Love
Phenomenon

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,560
Countless times. Yes.

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,670
O-One moment, please! Yes.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,690
Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes.

34
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,310
I'm sorry. Seems like
we've got a poor signal.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,850
Oh, give me a break. Are you done?

36
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,730
Can you hear me? Huh? Hello? Hello?

37
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,310
Okay, bye. Bye. Yes. Yes.

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Thank you.

39
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,460
Do we have a poor signal?

40
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,350
Good afternoon, everyone.

41
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,520
Here you go. Here. Here.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,460
What is this?

43
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,640
I put together a concert set list.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,310
You can't expect us to sing
under these circumstances.

45
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,610
Why aren't you stopping this?

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,160
Please. Tickets are selling like crazy.

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,900
But...

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,190
Could you two leave us for a second?

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,010
This can't be good.

50
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,970
I finally learned the
choreography and song, too.

51
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,030
They said we'd only be wearing masks
until Mitsuya-san came back, anyway.

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,460
I've been thinking, why don't we
start over at another agency?

53
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,830
I don't want anything to do
with this stuff anymore.

54
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,980
I know. Let's talk downstairs.

55
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,140
Those girls we met the other day...

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,280
I trusted you then.

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,040
I knew it. That's why you
couldn't call the police.

58
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,740
Who else is there?

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,600
How would I know?

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
You're the one who said it.

61
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,470
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,060
Maybe I said I wish they were dead,
but that was just a slip of the tongue.

63
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,760
I really didn't do it!

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,010
I know that. You have no reason
to lie to me, Nikaido.

65
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,300
Could you stop looking at me like that?
Like you know everything about me.

66
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,400
Why did you show up then, anyway?

67
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,320
Mitsuya called me.

68
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,050
Hello?

69
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,470
Oh, hello.

70
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,810
Why are you calling so late?

71
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,280
Nikaido-san asked me to come to the office.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,890
I'm scared.

73
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,980
Nikaido did?

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,710
Yeah. I hope I'm just overthinking it.

75
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,910
Could you come, too, Yamamoto-san?

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,650
Where are you now?

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,300
I'm on my way there in a taxi.
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,980
Fine. I'll be right there.

79
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,790
Huh? Why are you sitting in the dark?

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,950
Don't scare me like that, Nikaido.

81
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,930
What?

82
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,650
What is it? What's wrong?

83
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,720
Huh? Mitsuya?

84
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
What is this?

85
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,130
What did you...

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,040
Wait, wait, wait! How could you do this now?!

87
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,500
We're screwed if people find out about this.

88
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,840
Let me think for a second.

89
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,230
Okay, we're good. We're all good.

90
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,220
I know someone who will do anything
for the right price. No, wait...

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,900
Did anyone see you come here?
Did you take the train?

92
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,730
Damn it! I shouldn't have taken a taxi.

93
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,040
I walked.

94
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,850
We need to hire a professional.

95
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,520
It's okay.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,540
Yano-san, what should we do?

97
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,400
Don't give up, man.

98
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,170
I seriously can't with this.

99
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:08,700
Looks like she was bludgeoned
by a pissed off Nikaido,

100
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,660
then strangled by Yamamoto.

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,380
"Never murder no matter how fat
the stacks" is the boss' roots.

102
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,200
Now it's my rule.

103
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,920
But you played fast and loose,
now you went and screwed the pooch.

104
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,630
To me, that's how it looks.

105
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,570
Hey, you. Spread that tarp over there.

106
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,350
Come on.

107
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,850
We're gonna move her. Hurry up.

108
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,810
Okay.

109
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Hey.

110
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,170
Hurry, hurry.

111
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,570
Um, where are we going?

112
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,820
Out to sea, then towards Kawasaki.

113
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,210
Land routes are too dangerous.

114
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,940
What? We're going to toss her into the sea?

115
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,780
She'd come floating back
up right away, idiot.

116
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,080
We're gonna melt her.

117
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,470
Wouldn't that construction site
be a better place to hide her?

118
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,180
That's our last resort.

119
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,400
Last resort?

120
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,220
No one ever resorts to using a last resort.

121
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,850
That land belongs to the group, idiot.

122
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,680
We're doing this without
the higher ups' knowledge.

123
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,260
We're screwed if they find out.

124
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,450
Hurry up or the sun will come up.

125
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,950
Push that side. We'll dump her.

126
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,540
Let's dump her.

127
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,890
Are you okay?

128
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,130
Unbelievable. Yano-san,
could you handle the engine?

129
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,940
What?

130
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,120
Hey!

131
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,460
You idiots! What are you doing?!

132
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,350
Hey, Nikaido, um...

133
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,240
Hello.

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,210
What? Yuki?

135
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,310
Yuki! Are you okay?!

136
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,180
Hey! Are you okay?

137
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,880
Someone get a teacher!

138
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,390
Got it!

139
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,350
Yuki? What's wrong?

140
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,440
It's Yuki!

141
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,300
This is bad.

142
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,390
Are you okay? Yuki? Yuki?

143
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,550
Are you okay? Yuki!

144
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,080
Yes?

145
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,850
You came to see me?

146
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,500
Yeah.

147
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,090
Yuki-chan, we're gonna go.

148
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,590
Okay.

149
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,990
We'll visit again before you move.

150
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,250
Thanks. Bye. Thanks.

151
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,440
See you later.

152
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,030
Bye.

153
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,250
Take care.

154
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,560
It's good to see you again.

155
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,870
Good to see you.

156
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,140
I'm amazed she showed her face here.

157
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,710
Right? Talk about shameless.

158
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,590
Yuki, you're moving?

159
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,250
Yeah. I'm transferring schools.

160
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,320
What?

161
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,990
It's not your fault, Rena-san.

162
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,110
I was always planning to move in
with my father who lives in Tokyo.

163
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,890
I see. So, how are you doing?

164
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,360
A lot better. See?

165
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,120
Rena-san, I heard you were suspended.

166
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,070
I'm sorry that happened because of me.

167
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,770
No, uh...

168
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,710
Tokyo, huh? Lucky. I'd love to go hang out.

169
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,840
Kanon-san, you're thinking
of Harajuku, aren't you?

170
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,720
My father's house is in Nerima.

171
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,530
It's not that different from here.

172
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,020
No way! When are you moving?

173
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,120
As soon as I'm out of the hospital.

174
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,290
I see.

175
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,100
Hey, Rena. Yuki said she wanted to see you.

176
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,470
What?

177
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,200
I thought we'd regret not seeing
each other before we parted ways.

178
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,280
Right?

179
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,450
I still like you, Rena-san, so...

180
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,150
Wait, what about me?

181
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,310
Kanon-san, you'll forget
about me before long.

182
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,740
How could you? You know that's not true.

183
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,830
Let's hang out in Tokyo
together sometime, okay?

184
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,880
Agreed!

185
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,680
Right, Rena?

186
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,090
Oh, right. That keychain.

187
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,520
Thank you. I'll treasure it.

188
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,310
It's so cute.

189
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,240
Rena-san? I hope you're not crying.

190
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,370
It'll make it harder to see you again.

191
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,610
Thank you.

192
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,300
Thank you.

193
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,970
Rena-chan, thank you so much
for coming today.

194
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,550
We were just going to invite family, but
we wanted to make an exception for you.

195
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,210
I'm sure Yuki is happy, too.

196
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,590
Thank you for all that you've done.

197
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,550
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything to help.

198
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,150
That's not true at all. You kept
searching for her until the end.

199
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,320
Are you two all right?

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,030
Yeah.

201
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,930
I'm relieved Yuki finally came back to us.

202
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,530
Right.

203
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,310
Rena-chan, you can come talk
to us anytime you're hurting.

204
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:55,970
Um, I did a terrible thing to Yuki-san.

205
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,580
What do you mean?

206
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:13,750
I'm the one who injured her
on the stairs in high school.

207
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,360
That's in the past.

208
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,410
I liked Yuki.

209
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,700
She was so brilliant, it frustrated me.

210
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:45,050
I still don't understand what
I did then or why I did it.

211
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,180
It eats away at me so much
I don't know what to do.

212
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,950
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,880
Yes! I hope you'll come!

214
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,520
I'll pick you up. Okay, thank you!

215
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,460
Excuse me.

216
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,950
Yamamoto-san.

217
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,220
Um, Nikaido-san.

218
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,240
You know why we're here, don't you?

219
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,840
You're under arrest for the murder
of Mitsuya Yuki on December 24th

220
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,860
and abandoning her body.

221
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,550
What? Wait, what do you mean?

222
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,310
On the 30th, police arrested Mystery Kiss
member and suspect Nikaido Rui

223
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,700
who was voluntarily undergoing
questioning for the murder

224
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,730
of fellow group member Mitsuya
Yuki-san and abandoning her body.

225
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,770
The suspect is denying some of the charges.

226
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Suspect Yamamoto

227
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Group manager, suspected of abandoning and
mutilating a corpse with suspect Nikaido Rui

228
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,160
The police have also arrested the group's
 manager Yamamoto Fuyuki,

229
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:32,340
What?

230
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:32,340
Suspected of Murdering Idol

231
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:32,340
Fellow Group Member Arrested

232
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,830
Suspect Yano Haruhito (27)

233
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,830
Arrested & detained for one billion yen robbery → Rearrested
Under investigation for involvement in criminal organization

234
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,830
and rearrested self-proclaimed company
managers Yano Haruhito and Sekiguchi Togo,

235
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,060
who were previously arrested and
detained on separate robbery charges,

236
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:32,340
Suspect Sekiguchi Togo (33)

237
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:32,340
Arrested & detained for one billion yen robbery → Rearrested
Under investigation for involvement in criminal organization

238
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,340
this time for abandoning
 and mutilating a corpse.

239
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,890
I'd like to try disguising myself.

240
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,510
Sure, do it. What?

241
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,650
Hello.

242
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,600
Hello. Feels like it's been a while, huh?

243
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,540
You should've let me know you were coming.

244
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,930
Sorry. The Yuki stuff has calmed down
for now, so I came to tidy up.

245
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,680
What about the future? Have you
already decided what you're going to do?

246
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,460
Not really.

247
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,350
Don't be so secretive.

248
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,950
I've been learning on the job
for a while now,

249
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,490
so I figured I'd do some
classroom learning for a while.

250
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,100
What classroom learning?

251
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,840
You're going to college?

252
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,430
I'll start by getting my
secondary school certificate.

253
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,940
Then I'll study the law properly.

254
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,060
What about an online program?

255
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,790
Then you can keep working while you study.

256
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,260
That's what my second cousin's
husband's sister's friend did,

257
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,860
and she makes tons of money now.

258
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,610
Why don't you do that while
you come back to work for us?

259
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,490
Finding a new investigator would be
a lot of work. Right, boss?

260
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,460
What are you talking about? We've got me.

261
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,780
Who, you? Where?

262
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,480
According to their investigation,

263
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,870
Hey! I'm already right here, aren't I?

264
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,040
police found signs that Mitsuya-san
was struck on the head with a blunt object

265
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,420
You just joined recently.

266
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,760
and strangled with something like a cable.

267
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,330
Also, there was no weapon
found at the crime scene.

268
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,640
Based on the method used,

269
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,120
the police believe the culprit held
a strong grudge against Mitsuya-san

270
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,230
and are currently
questioning multiple people

271
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,730
who may have had interpersonal
issues with the victim.

272
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,810
What happened to you today?

273
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,350
Sorry for suddenly asking to meet.

274
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,880
It's totally fine. It's not like
I have anything else to do.

275
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,920
Everyone's been arrested.
My schedule's wide open.

276
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,750
Thank you for waiting.

277
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,100
Wait, really?

278
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,450
You have my support.

279
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,500
This is so awkward.

280
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,680
Now I'm famous for something weird.
Did you see the news?

281
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,760
Yeah. Sorry I didn't notice.

282
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,960
It's fine. Now I don't have to wear a mask.

283
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,430
I figured out a bunch of things
because you called me the other day.

284
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,320
I wanted to thank you for that today.

285
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,780
Really? You mean about Nikaido-san?

286
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:04,570
Yeah. It made me realize there are
unimaginably scary things out there.

287
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,680
Wadagaki-san, what are you going to do?

288
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,240
I've actually been recruited
by another agency.

289
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
Another agency? You're going
to keep being an idol?

290
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,180
I can't let that bring me down.
It's the reason I came to Tokyo.

291
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,670
I can't go home until
I've accomplished something.

292
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,010
Right.

293
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,270
Besides, I haven't been paid yet.

294
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,270
I can't even get in touch
with the company president.

295
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,060
I've gotten caught in the crossfire.

296
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,270
Crossfire?

297
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,730
Huh?

298
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,290
Come to think of it,

299
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,790
you and Ichimura-san must've been asked
what you were doing the day of the incident.

300
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,760
Yeah. This again?

301
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,530
The police asked me too,
but it was a normal day for me.

302
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,260
I went to my dance lesson,
and then I went home.

303
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,920
Why do you ask?

304
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,210
Your dance lesson, huh?
What about Ichimura-san?

305
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,470
I don't know. Probably
doing her sugar daddy job.

306
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,190
Maybe that was the reason.

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,170
What caused Nikaido-san
and Mitsuya-san's disagreement?

308
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Nikaido-san had a harsh personality.

309
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,650
Is that a reason to do that?

310
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,940
What's gotten into you?
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

311
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,020
Do you?

312
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:28,390
I'm trying to move onto
my next step, so could you not?

313
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,300
You're right.

314
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,590
Wadagaki-san?

315
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,340
Wadagaki-san?

316
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,630
Sato?

317
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,620
She just left. Be careful.

318
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,280
I thought if I became an idol
I'd be able to meet my dad.

319
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:15,000
Next Time

320
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,180
My dad is a storyteller.
His name is Donraku.

321
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,860
If you're so unmotivated,
why don't you just quit?

322
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,520
