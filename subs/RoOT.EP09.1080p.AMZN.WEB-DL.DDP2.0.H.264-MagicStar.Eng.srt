1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,580
Sorry I'm late today.

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,840
You're still homeless, huh?

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,450
This nation really will fall
due to incompetent politicians.

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,630
Those damn nepo-baby Diet members—

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,200
Mom, I've been wondering.
Why do you turn off the TV?

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,330
Because we're gonna eat.
Come on, sit up straight.

7
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,360
You always turn off the TV
when Donraku comes on.

8
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,760
We promised not to talk about that anymore.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,780
We used to have tons of pictures of him up.

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,290
How long are you gonna hide it?

11
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,600
I might see him in Tokyo.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,690
I'm saying this for your sake.

13
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,560
Once you grow up, someday you'll
understand, whether you like it or not.

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,350
Um, excuse me. Is the
audition in this building?

15
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,100
I dunno. Look it up yourself, why don't you?

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,660
Are you auditioning today?

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,090
Huh? Uh, yes.

18
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,490
Then let's go together.

19
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,500
Thank you for earlier.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,660
It's totally fine. That map
was impossible to understand.

21
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,280
Yeah. I just came to Tokyo yesterday.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,100
What? Wow.

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,600
That must've made it
even harder to understand.

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,860
Where are you from?

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,100
Oita.

26
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,760
Is that why your backpack's so big?

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,520
I even packed everything I need.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,020
What? Really?

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,650
You didn't bring anything?

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,250
Oh, right. I didn't notice.

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,030
You seem so calm. You're not nervous at all.

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
I actually just noticed
since you mentioned it,

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,250
but I seem to have forgotten my bag
 at home because I was so nervous.

34
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,970
What? Seriously?

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,050
I'm Mitsuya Yuki. Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,870
I thought if I became an idol
I'd be able to meet my dad.

37
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,700
That's a nice dream.
I'm sure it'll come true.

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,300
Why did you audition, Mitsuya-san?

39
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,480
I think my reason's a bit like yours.

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,670
Like my father, I wanted to
make people laugh and cry.

41
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,400
I wanted to get a job in entertainment
that would let me move people's hearts.

42
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,210
That's amazing! Your dad's an entertainer?

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,270
Oh, but I didn't tell him I'm auditioning.

44
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,760
My father said he'd introduce me
to some people in the business he knows,

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,630
but then I wouldn't be
doing it myself, you know?

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,880
That sounds like a wasted opportunity.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,220
Not at all.

48
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,990
I don't want people to say I only
got the job because of my father.

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,030
He honed his art all on his own.

50
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,980
Huh.

51
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm kind of jealous.

52
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,890
Oh, sorry. I shouldn't have said all that.

53
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,630
Sorry. Forget what I said.

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,090
It's totally fine. I'm used to it.

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,640
It'd be great if we both passed the audition.

56
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,000
I had the same thought!

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,970
Really?

58
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,310
Sorry, I know this was sudden!

59
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,410
It's fine.

60
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,460
I was glad to hear from you, Mitsuya-san.

61
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,890
So, listen...

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,730
Yeah?

63
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,540
I got a call after that.

64
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,110
They called me in for a final screening.

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,420
Really? That's great!

67
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,740
I wanted to tell you in person.

68
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,340
What about you, Sakura-chan?
Did you get your results yet?

69
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,100
No, nothing.

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,830
Then you still have a chance.

71
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,640
Really?

72
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,860
They're still deciding.
They didn't tell me anything else.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,070
But I'm sure you'd pass another audition.

74
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,200
Yeah. I'm broke, so I can't
even go back home now.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,390
If it comes to it, I'll ask
my father if he has any ideas.

76
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,050
What does your dad do?

77
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,230
Oh, right. Sorry.

78
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,210
You don't have to hide it.

79
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,170
It's embarrassing.

80
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,280
What? Why? You should hold your head high.

81
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,810
You passed the audition on your own merits.

82
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,230
My dad is a storyteller.
Do you know about rakugo?

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,390
Yeah.

84
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,330
He's on TV a lot.

85
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,520
He had a reputation for casually
saying things that upset people,

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,400
so I was a little embarrassed about it.

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,820
Maybe you know him. His name is Donraku.

88
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,370
Huh...

What is it, Mom?

110
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,230
A letter arrived for you.

111
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,740
It said it was from a place
called Gray Dog Agency.

112
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,280
It finally arrived.
It must be the audition results.

113
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,130
I know that.

114
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,390
How?

115
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,530
Because I opened it right away.

116
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,190
Oh, right.

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,700
Mom?

118
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,520
"After a fair and impartial review,

119
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,630
we regret to inform you that
you did not pass the audition."

122
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,580
Right?

123
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,510
I thought there must be some mistake, so
I called them, but they wouldn't talk to me.

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,760
You should be able to pass

We met at the audition.

Oh, uh...

133
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,770
How can I get in?

134

Um, you know, we're a small agency that
was just established. We're short-staffed.

Sakura-chan?

137
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,930
If I wasn't chosen to be one of them,
then I'd like to know why!

138
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,450
I don't remember the exact reason. Sorry.

139
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,670
Mitsuya-san.

What?

What about Mitsuya-san?

142
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,150
Mitsuya?

143
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,050
Um...

144
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,000
Come on. Let's go.

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,360
Oh, right. I remember now.

146
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,170
You were the runner-up behind Mitsuya.

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,380
You were so close.
If only you had a bit more charm.

148
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,240
Oh, I know. We're going to
hold another audition.

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,660
Why don't you practice until then?

150
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll be in touch. Thanks.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,410
Let's get going.

152
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,220
Take a 15-minute break, and then we'll
check your formation on the next pass.

153
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,880
Okay.

154
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,540
That girl was kind of crazy.

155
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Who?

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,730
She was so desperate to know why she failed.

157
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,490
What? Of course she was desperate.
What's crazy about that?

158
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,910
You know, your dancing is sloppy,
and you're not getting any better.

159
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,300
Do you even want to do this?

160
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,980
My house is too cramped
to practice on my own.

161
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,310
Oh, really? That must be so hard for you.

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,520
You're full of excuses. That other girl
was way more motivated than you.

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,300
Hey, come on.

164
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,030
Is this really worth getting worked up about?

165
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,330
If you're so unmotivated,
why don't you just quit?

166
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,250
I told you, my family's actually really poor.

167
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,770
I need the money, so I'm not quitting.

168
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,630
Quit it, you two.

169
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,370
You know, you talk about auditioning, but
you've known the manager for a long time.

170
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,450
Sounds super shady to me.

171
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,320
Hey, come on. The three of us
are going to be a team.

172
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,710
Let's try to work together, okay?

173
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,040
Why should I? I don't have time for that.

174
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,120
I've been trying to this whole time.

175
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,710
We've been forced to bend to her every whim.

176
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,420
Maybe, but we're going to have to
work together like this for a while.

177
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,130
You're too soft. Someone needs
to give it to her straight.

178
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,770
Fine. Then you should go solo, Nikaido-san.

179
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,060
I want to go as far as I can with this team.

180
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,630
Maybe it's selfish,

181
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,980
but I understand how both of you feel,
and I want to respect that.

182
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,110
What's your deal?

183
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,600
If anything comes up,
let me know by call or text.

184
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,450
Good night.

185
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,420
Good night.

186
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,440
Good night.

187
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,850
Here.

188
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,740
What?

189
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,960
Sorry about earlier.

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,560
Nikaido-san, you eat this stuff, too?

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,050
Today is special.

192
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,250
Thanks.

193
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,360
Why did you two want to become idols?

194
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,790
I don't have my own room at home.

195
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,810
The bathtub's the only place
I can call my own.

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,990
So I want to move to a place with a huge tub.

197
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,950
In other words, I want to be rich.

198
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,600
Huh, I see.

199
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,900
You won't be able to afford a big tub
if you're barely managing the choreography.

200
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,610
I wish you at least wouldn't
hold me or Mitsuya-san back.

201
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,810
Sorry.

202
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,180
You're struggling with the B part, right?
I'll show you a trick to doing it.

203
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,610
Thanks, I think.

204
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,150
What about you, Mitsuya-san?

205
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,980
Why an idol?

206
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Yeah.

207
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,250
From watching my dad, I think.

208
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,360
God, just how much of a good girl are you?

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,740
You think?

210
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,590
There aren't many girls like you these days.

211
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,030
Okay, let's try smiling more now.

212
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,860
Nice. Could you come forward?

213
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,670
This girl's got a powerful aura.

214
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,690
She's gonna be big.

215
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,860
I know Nikaido is a winner, too.

216
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,290
Actually, since her previous agency—

217
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,850
Oh, not her. This girl.

218
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,190
This Mitsuya girl.

219
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh, yeah.

220
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,800
It's like she's on another level.

221
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,490
Like I told you before, Yamamoto-chan...

222
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,160
Yes.

223
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,040
I feel like Mitsuya-san was born
with something different.

224
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,250
She's gonna turn into something incredible.

225
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,190
Sounds good to me.

226
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,090
Nikaido's talented. As long as she
supports her, they'll make a good team.

227
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,460
Good morning. Good to see you again.

228
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,410
Good morning.

229
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,800
Good morning.

230
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,790
What? A debut tour?

231
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,950
Yeah. I worked really hard for this.

232
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,370
But I still don't have
the choreography down yet.

233
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,660
Oh, uh...

234
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,100
What is this?

235
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Oh, um...

236
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,410
That's the artist photo we're gonna go with.

237
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,290
Be direct with them, Yamamoto-kun.
Mitsuya is going to be the center.

238
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,840
You girls back her up
and make Mystery Kiss big.

239
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,000
MAIN A Photo

240
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Let's book all the domes. All of them!

242
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,380
What's the meaning of this?

243
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,840
Sorry, but the situation has changed.

244
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
This isn't what you promised!

245
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,450
Let me explain it you sometime.

246
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,340
I'm home!

247
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,220
How could you be so selfish?

248
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,920
I'm discussing it with you
right now, aren't I?

249
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,170
Dad, are you home?

250
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,670
I think Yuki's ready to meet them.

251
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,630
This is a difficult time for Yuki.
She can't do that.

252
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,270
Besides, if people find out about
your relationships from that time—oh?

253
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,290
Yuki?

254
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,560
Say something if you're home.

255
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,190
You're one of the top ten most
streamed artists in Japan right now.

256
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,210
That's incredible.

257
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,210
Because of the incident,
not because of our talent.

258
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,660
So, have you given any thought to the future?

259
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,250
Yes. I came here today with the intention
of signing on with your agency.

260
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,360
Me, too.

261
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,880
I actually put together a plan for your
future activities and upcoming schedule.

262
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,440
Wow.

263
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,580
That said, I'm not ready yet emotionally—

264
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,760
We're currently negotiating
for you to keep your name.

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,400
You'd be either the New Mystery Kiss or this.

266
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,360
Kiss Miss

267
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,780
What? Ugh, no way.

268
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,220
I certainly hope we can!

269
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,790
Oh, would I continue using
the same stage name?

270
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,070
What? You mean Mitsuya Yuki?

271
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,050
Yes.

272
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,210
I don't know about that.

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Then could I get an advance on my rent?

274
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,470
Yeah, sure.

275
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,180
I look forward to working with you.

276
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,870
Yeah!

277
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,230
It's strange, isn't it?

278
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,600
Lost Cat!

279
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,800
Nobody paid attention to us before.

280
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,910
But I'm glad things turned out this way.

281
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,240
You are? I didn't like it before,
but now I want to wear a mask again.

282
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,330
I'd rather appear on TV
without being recognized.

283
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,230
Lately I feel like all kinds of people
are watching me, and it's scary.

284
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,960
Isn't that what it means to be an idol?

285
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,080
You mentioned wanting to
keep using Mitsuya-san's name.

286
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,000
Can't I?

287
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,980
You were serious? Isn't that kind of crazy?

288
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,830
Hey. Time to eat.

289
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,630
At first glance, they seemed
to be enjoying brilliant careers

290
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,070
in the entertainment industry,
but on the inside...

291
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,890
On the inside—

292
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,890
I realized something.

293
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,190
We couldn't stay here and keep
allowing ourselves to be exploited.

294
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,950
That's why we took our masks off.

295
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,190
We want people to see our real faces.

296
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,020
It was a difficult time.

297
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,710
I thought I'd become an idol, but
not only was I forced to wear a mask,

298
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,940
I had to get dinner every night
with a strange man my father's age.

299
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,530
I was paid to do it.

300
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,940
Sorry.

301
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,810
My dad abandoned my mom a long time ago.

302
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,070
I've never met my real father.

303
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,110
That's why I decided to become an idol.

304
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,540
If you're watching this, Dad, contact me.

305
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,390
I knew they'd be on their guard.

306
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,990
So, you were questioned?

307
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,040
I made it through that fine,
but I heard something interesting.

308
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,600
A few stray cats have died
around that apartment.

309
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,500
What are you looking at?

310
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,630
The video we took that day.

311
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,380
Watch the office.

312
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,930
The lights are on.

313
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,970
And then they go out.

314
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,280
Huh? Wait a minute.

315
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,780
Hey! What are you doing?

316
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,860
Found it.

317
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,940
Do you always have to be so loud?

318
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,440
This is before Nikaido entered the office.

319
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,120
23:47. 23:21.

320
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,730
Huh? You're right.

321
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,990
Hello? One moment, please.

322
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,000
Which means...

323
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,000
What does it mean?

324
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,830
Rena-chan, phone for you. It's Donraku-san.

325
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,270
Huh? Sakura-chan?

326
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,100
Mitsuya-san, why are you here?

327
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,380
What are you doing here?

328
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,870
I don't have anywhere to stay right now.

329
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,520
What? Do you want to stay at my place, then?

330
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,540
You're a really nice person.

331
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,010
I'm flat broke.

332
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,940
I figured I'd be lucky
if I could spend one night here.

333
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,980
It was pouring earlier, you know?

334
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,000
I jumped into a taxi.

335
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,150
I didn't think I'd be able
to get in so easily.

336
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,670
You don't have a home?

337
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,760
Not right now, so I'm prepared
to live anywhere.

338
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,840
We exchanged contact information.
You could've called me anytime.

339
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,040
What are you doing here
at this hour, Mitsuya-san?

340
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,990
Oh...

341
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,270
It's not work, is it?

342
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,770
Nikaido-san asked me to come.

343
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,030
Nikaido?

344
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,640
She's a girl in my group.

345
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,460
Huh. Why?

346
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,810
Probably because I might become the center.

347
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,540
The center?

348
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Yeah.

349
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,500
Nikaido-san's been doing this a long time,
so I think she assumed it would be her.

350
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,610
Oh, so you stole the best position from her.

351
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,420
I didn't take anything from her.

352
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,730
I don't really get it either,

353
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,800
but it's people like the producer
who make those decisions.

354
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,210
I'm hoping we can talk it out
and resolve any misunderstandings.

355
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,770
Is it really a misunderstanding?

356
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,420
I'm glad you're here, though.

357
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,990
I felt anxious on my way here.

358
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:22,230
Ever since we met, for some reason
I've felt strangely at ease when I'm with you.

359
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,570
Huh.

360
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,320
I wonder if Nikaido-san will get here soon.

361
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,930
I was supposed to become you.

362
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,680
Hello? Is this Wadagaki Sakura-san's phone?

363
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,130
Who is this?

364
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm Yamamoto of Gray Dog, Inc.

365
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,210
I wanted to discuss something with you.

366
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,330
Yamamoto-san? I don't know
what you're talking about.

367
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,730
What? That's odd.
Didn't you audition with us?

368
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,130
Did you join another agency after that?

369
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,910
What? No, nothing like that.

370
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:59,270
If you haven't changed your mind, I'd like
to meet with you in person and talk again.

371
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,980
Really?

372
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,280
Are you really quitting?

373
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:15,990
Next Time

374
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,950
She's claiming to be his
18-year-old biological child.

375
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,990
Do you remember who you
drove on October 4th?

376
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,870
Someone else killed Yuki.

377
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,900
Dad!

378
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,750
Where to?

379
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,980
This show is a work of fiction.
