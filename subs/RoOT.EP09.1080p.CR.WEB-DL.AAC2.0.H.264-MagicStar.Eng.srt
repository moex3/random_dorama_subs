1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,580
Sorry I'm late today.

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,840
You're still homeless, huh?

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,450
This nation really will fall
due to incompetent politicians.

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,630
Those damn nepo-baby Diet members—

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,200
Mom, I've been wondering.
Why do you turn off the TV?

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,330
Because we're gonna eat.
Come on, sit up straight.

7
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,360
You always turn off the TV
when Donraku comes on.

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,760
We promised not to talk about that anymore.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,780
We used to have tons of pictures of him up.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,290
How long are you gonna hide it?

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,600
I might see him in Tokyo.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,690
I'm saying this for your sake.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,560
Once you grow up, someday you'll
understand, whether you like it or not.

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,350
Um, excuse me. Is the
audition in this building?

15
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,100
I dunno. Look it up yourself, why don't you?

16
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,660
Are you auditioning today?

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,090
Huh? Uh, yes.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,490
Then let's go together.

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,500
Thank you for earlier.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,660
It's totally fine. That map
was impossible to understand.

21
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,280
Yeah. I just came to Tokyo yesterday.

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,100
What? Wow.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,600
That must've made it
even harder to understand.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,860
Where are you from?

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,100
Oita.

26
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,760
Is that why your backpack's so big?

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,520
I even packed everything I need.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,020
What? Really?

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,650
You didn't bring anything?

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,250
Oh, right. I didn't notice.

31
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,030
You seem so calm. You're not nervous at all.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,380
I actually just noticed
since you mentioned it,

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,250
but I seem to have forgotten my bag
 at home because I was so nervous.

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,970
What? Seriously?

35
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,050
I'm Mitsuya Yuki. Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,870
I thought if I became an idol
I'd be able to meet my dad.

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,700
That's a nice dream.
I'm sure it'll come true.

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,300
Why did you audition, Mitsuya-san?

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,480
I think my reason's a bit like yours.

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,670
Like my father, I wanted to
make people laugh and cry.

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,400
I wanted to get a job in entertainment
that would let me move people's hearts.

42
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,210
That's amazing! Your dad's an entertainer?

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,270
Oh, but I didn't tell him I'm auditioning.

44
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,760
My father said he'd introduce me
to some people in the business he knows,

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,630
but then I wouldn't be
doing it myself, you know?

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,880
That sounds like a wasted opportunity.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,220
Not at all.

48
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,990
I don't want people to say I only
got the job because of my father.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,030
He honed his art all on his own.

50
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,980
Huh.

51
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm kind of jealous.

52
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,890
Oh, sorry. I shouldn't have said all that.

53
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,630
Sorry. Forget what I said.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,090
It's totally fine. I'm used to it.

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,640
It'd be great if we both passed the audition.

56
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,000
I had the same thought!

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,970
Really?

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,310
Sorry, I know this was sudden!

59
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,410
It's fine.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,460
I was glad to hear from you, Mitsuya-san.

61
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,890
So, listen...

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,730
Yeah?

63
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,540
I got a call after that.

64
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,080
Yeah.

65
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,110
They called me in for a final screening.

66
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,420
Really? That's great!

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,740
I wanted to tell you in person.

68
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,340
What about you, Sakura-chan?
Did you get your results yet?

69
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,100
No, nothing.

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,830
Then you still have a chance.

71
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,640
Really?

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,860
They're still deciding.
They didn't tell me anything else.

73
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,070
But I'm sure you'd pass another audition.

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,200
Yeah. I'm broke, so I can't
even go back home now.

75
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,390
If it comes to it, I'll ask
my father if he has any ideas.

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,050
What does your dad do?

77
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,230
Oh, right. Sorry.

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,210
You don't have to hide it.

79
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,170
It's embarrassing.

80
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,280
What? Why? You should hold your head high.

81
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,810
You passed the audition on your own merits.

82
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,230
My dad is a storyteller.
Do you know about rakugo?

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,390
Yeah.

84
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,330
He's on TV a lot.

85
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,520
He had a reputation for casually
saying things that upset people,

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
so I was a little embarrassed about it.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,820
Maybe you know him. His name is Donraku.

88
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,370
Huh...

What is it, Mom?

110
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,230
A letter arrived for you.

111
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,740
It said it was from a place
called Gray Dog Agency.

112
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,280
It finally arrived.
It must be the audition results.

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,130
I know that.

114
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,390
How?

115
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,530
Because I opened it right away.

116
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,190
Oh, right.

117
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,700
Mom?

118
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,520
"After a fair and impartial review,

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,630
we regret to inform you that
you did not pass the audition."

122
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,580
Right?

123
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,510
I thought there must be some mistake, so
I called them, but they wouldn't talk to me.

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,760
You should be able to pass

We met at the audition.

Oh, uh...

133
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,770
How can I get in?

134

Um, you know, we're a small agency that
was just established. We're short-staffed.

Sakura-chan?

137
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,930
If I wasn't chosen to be one of them,
then I'd like to know why!

138
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,450
I don't remember the exact reason. Sorry.

139
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,670
Mitsuya-san.

What?

What about Mitsuya-san?

142
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,150
Mitsuya?

143
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,050
Um...

144
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,000
Come on. Let's go.

145
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh, right. I remember now.

146
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,170
You were the runner-up behind Mitsuya.

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,380
You were so close.
If only you had a bit more charm.

148
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,240
Oh, I know. We're going to
hold another audition.

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,660
Why don't you practice until then?

150
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll be in touch. Thanks.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,410
Let's get going.

152
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,220
Take a 15-minute break, and then we'll
check your formation on the next pass.

153
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,880
Okay.

154
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,540
That girl was kind of crazy.

155
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Who?

156
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,730
She was so desperate to know why she failed.

157
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,490
What? Of course she was desperate.
What's crazy about that?

158
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,910
You know, your dancing is sloppy,
and you're not getting any better.

159
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,300
Do you even want to do this?

160
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,980
My house is too cramped
to practice on my own.

161
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,310
Oh, really? That must be so hard for you.

162
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,520
You're full of excuses. That other girl
was way more motivated than you.

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,300
Hey, come on.

164
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,030
Is this really worth getting worked up about?

165
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,330
If you're so unmotivated,
why don't you just quit?

166
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,250
I told you, my family's actually really poor.

167
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,770
I need the money, so I'm not quitting.

168
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,630
Quit it, you two.

169
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,370
You know, you talk about auditioning, but
you've known the manager for a long time.

170
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,450
Sounds super shady to me.

171
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,320
Hey, come on. The three of us
are going to be a team.

172
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,710
Let's try to work together, okay?

173
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,040
Why should I? I don't have time for that.

174
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
I've been trying to this whole time.

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,710
We've been forced to bend to her every whim.

176
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,420
Maybe, but we're going to have to
work together like this for a while.

177
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,130
You're too soft. Someone needs
to give it to her straight.

178
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,770
Fine. Then you should go solo, Nikaido-san.

179
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,060
I want to go as far as I can with this team.

180
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,630
Maybe it's selfish,

181
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,980
but I understand how both of you feel,
and I want to respect that.

182
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,110
What's your deal?

183
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,600
If anything comes up,
let me know by call or text.

184
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,450
Good night.

185
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,420
Good night.

186
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,440
Good night.

187
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,850
Here.

188
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,740
What?

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,960
Sorry about earlier.

190
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,560
Nikaido-san, you eat this stuff, too?

191
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,050
Today is special.

192
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,250
Thanks.

193
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,360
Why did you two want to become idols?

194
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,790
I don't have my own room at home.

195
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,810
The bathtub's the only place
I can call my own.

196
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,990
So I want to move to a place with a huge tub.

197
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,950
In other words, I want to be rich.

198
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,600
Huh, I see.

199
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,900
You won't be able to afford a big tub
if you're barely managing the choreography.

200
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,610
I wish you at least wouldn't
hold me or Mitsuya-san back.

201
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,810
Sorry.

202
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,180
You're struggling with the B part, right?
I'll show you a trick to doing it.

203
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,610
Thanks, I think.

204
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,150
What about you, Mitsuya-san?

205
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,980
Why an idol?

206
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Yeah.

207
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,250
From watching my dad, I think.

208
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,360
God, just how much of a good girl are you?

209
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,740
You think?

210
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,590
There aren't many girls like you these days.

211
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,030
Okay, let's try smiling more now.

212
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,860
Nice. Could you come forward?

213
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,670
This girl's got a powerful aura.

214
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,690
She's gonna be big.

215
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,860
I know Nikaido is a winner, too.

216
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,290
Actually, since her previous agency—

217
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,850
Oh, not her. This girl.

218
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,190
This Mitsuya girl.

219
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,320
Oh, yeah.

220
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,800
It's like she's on another level.

221
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,490
Like I told you before, Yamamoto-chan...

222
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,160
Yes.

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,040
I feel like Mitsuya-san was born
with something different.

224
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,250
She's gonna turn into something incredible.

225
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,190
Sounds good to me.

226
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,090
Nikaido's talented. As long as she
supports her, they'll make a good team.

227
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,460
Good morning. Good to see you again.

228
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,410
Good morning.

229
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,800
Good morning.

230
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,790
What? A debut tour?

231
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,950
Yeah. I worked really hard for this.

232
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,370
But I still don't have
the choreography down yet.

233
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,660
Oh, uh...

234
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
What is this?

235
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Oh, um...

236
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,410
That's the artist photo we're gonna go with.

237
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,290
Be direct with them, Yamamoto-kun.
Mitsuya is going to be the center.

238
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,840
You girls back her up
and make Mystery Kiss big.

239
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,000
MAIN A Photo

240
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,920
Let's book all the domes. All of them!

242
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,380
What's the meaning of this?

243
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,840
Sorry, but the situation has changed.

244
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,080
This isn't what you promised!

245
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,450
Let me explain it you sometime.

246
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,340
I'm home!

247
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,220
How could you be so selfish?

248
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm discussing it with you
right now, aren't I?

249
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,170
Dad, are you home?

250
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,670
I think Yuki's ready to meet them.

251
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,630
This is a difficult time for Yuki.
She can't do that.

252
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,270
Besides, if people find out about
your relationships from that time—oh?

253
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,290
Yuki?

254
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,560
Say something if you're home.

255
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,190
You're one of the top ten most
streamed artists in Japan right now.

256
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,210
That's incredible.

257
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,210
Because of the incident,
not because of our talent.

258
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,660
So, have you given any thought to the future?

259
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,250
Yes. I came here today with the intention
of signing on with your agency.

260
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,360
Me, too.

261
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,880
I actually put together a plan for your
future activities and upcoming schedule.

262
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,440
Wow.

263
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,580
That said, I'm not ready yet emotionally—

264
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,760
We're currently negotiating
for you to keep your name.

265
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,400
You'd be either the New Mystery Kiss or this.

266
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,360
Kiss Miss

267
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,780
What? Ugh, no way.

268
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,220
I certainly hope we can!

269
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,790
Oh, would I continue using
the same stage name?

270
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,070
What? You mean Mitsuya Yuki?

271
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,050
Yes.

272
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,210
I don't know about that.

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,800
Then could I get an advance on my rent?

274
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,470
Yeah, sure.

275
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,180
I look forward to working with you.

276
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,870
Yeah!

277
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,230
It's strange, isn't it?

278
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,600
Lost Cat!

279
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,800
Nobody paid attention to us before.

280
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,910
But I'm glad things turned out this way.

281
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,240
You are? I didn't like it before,
but now I want to wear a mask again.

282
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,330
I'd rather appear on TV
without being recognized.

283
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,230
Lately I feel like all kinds of people
are watching me, and it's scary.

284
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,960
Isn't that what it means to be an idol?

285
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,080
You mentioned wanting to
keep using Mitsuya-san's name.

286
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,000
Can't I?

287
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,980
You were serious? Isn't that kind of crazy?

288
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,830
Hey. Time to eat.

289
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,630
At first glance, they seemed
to be enjoying brilliant careers

290
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,070
in the entertainment industry,
but on the inside...

291
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,890
On the inside—

292
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,890
I realized something.

293
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,190
We couldn't stay here and keep
allowing ourselves to be exploited.

294
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,950
That's why we took our masks off.

295
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,190
We want people to see our real faces.

296
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,020
It was a difficult time.

297
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,710
I thought I'd become an idol, but
not only was I forced to wear a mask,

298
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,940
I had to get dinner every night
with a strange man my father's age.

299
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,530
I was paid to do it.

300
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,940
Sorry.

301
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,810
My dad abandoned my mom a long time ago.

302
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,070
I've never met my real father.

303
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,110
That's why I decided to become an idol.

304
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,540
If you're watching this, Dad, contact me.

305
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,390
I knew they'd be on their guard.

306
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,990
So, you were questioned?

307
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,040
I made it through that fine,
but I heard something interesting.

308
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,600
A few stray cats have died
around that apartment.

309
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,500
What are you looking at?

310
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,630
The video we took that day.

311
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,380
Watch the office.

312
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,930
The lights are on.

313
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,970
And then they go out.

314
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,280
Huh? Wait a minute.

315
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,780
Hey! What are you doing?

316
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,860
Found it.

317
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,940
Do you always have to be so loud?

318
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,440
This is before Nikaido entered the office.

319
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,120
23:47. 23:21.

320
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,730
Huh? You're right.

321
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,990
Hello? One moment, please.

322
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,000
Which means...

323
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,000
What does it mean?

324
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,830
Rena-chan, phone for you. It's Donraku-san.

325
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,270
Huh? Sakura-chan?

326
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,100
Mitsuya-san, why are you here?

327
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,380
What are you doing here?

328
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,870
I don't have anywhere to stay right now.

329
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,520
What? Do you want to stay at my place, then?

330
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,540
You're a really nice person.

331
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,010
I'm flat broke.

332
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,940
I figured I'd be lucky
if I could spend one night here.

333
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,980
It was pouring earlier, you know?

334
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,000
I jumped into a taxi.

335
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,150
I didn't think I'd be able
to get in so easily.

336
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,670
You don't have a home?

337
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,760
Not right now, so I'm prepared
to live anywhere.

338
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,840
We exchanged contact information.
You could've called me anytime.

339
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,040
What are you doing here
at this hour, Mitsuya-san?

340
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:14,990
Oh...

341
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,270
It's not work, is it?

342
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,770
Nikaido-san asked me to come.

343
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,030
Nikaido?

344
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,640
She's a girl in my group.

345
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,460
Huh. Why?

346
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,810
Probably because I might become the center.

347
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,540
The center?

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,960
Yeah.

349
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,500
Nikaido-san's been doing this a long time,
so I think she assumed it would be her.

350
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,610
Oh, so you stole the best position from her.

351
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,420
I didn't take anything from her.

352
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,730
I don't really get it either,

353
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,800
but it's people like the producer
who make those decisions.

354
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,210
I'm hoping we can talk it out
and resolve any misunderstandings.

355
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,770
Is it really a misunderstanding?

356
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,420
I'm glad you're here, though.

357
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,990
I felt anxious on my way here.

358
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:21,230
Ever since we met, for some reason
I've felt strangely at ease when I'm with you.

359
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,570
Huh.

360
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,320
I wonder if Nikaido-san will get here soon.

361
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,930
I was supposed to become you.

362
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,680
Hello? Is this Wadagaki Sakura-san's phone?

363
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,130
Who is this?

364
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,980
I'm Yamamoto of Gray Dog, Inc.

365
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,210
I wanted to discuss something with you.

366
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,330
Yamamoto-san? I don't know
what you're talking about.

367
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,730
What? That's odd.
Didn't you audition with us?

368
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,130
Did you join another agency after that?

369
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,910
What? No, nothing like that.

370
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:58,270
If you haven't changed your mind, I'd like
to meet with you in person and talk again.

371
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,980
Really?

372
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,280
Are you really quitting?

373
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:14,990
Next Time

374
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,950
She's claiming to be his
18-year-old biological child.

375
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,990
Do you remember who you
drove on October 4th?

376
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,870
Someone else killed Yuki.

377
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,900
Dad!

378
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,750
Where to?

379
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,980
This show is a work of fiction.
