1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,320
When did you receive these messages?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,360
Just yesterday.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,440
She's claiming to be his
18-year-old biological child.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,680
This is a threat.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,160
She wants to meet in person to confirm their
relationship, or she'll ruin the performance.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,460
Scary.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,930
We've experienced weird messages
and unhinged fans before,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,590
but this isn't a good time for that.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,470
You need the police or a lawyer.
We can't do anything for you.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,360
We've received a ton
of nonsensical messages.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,560
The police think it's some kind of prank
and won't do anything about it.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,750
There's nothing they can do if it's
just threats to ruin the show.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,610
Since Yuki's death, I've been receiving
more messages slandering me.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,990
The entertainment industry sounds rough.

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,830
But thankfully, we've been getting more
supportive and encouraging messages as well.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,330
People have always sent me their thoughts
on my shows or new rakugo scripts.

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,600
But this is no joke.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,380
I guess the silver lining is that I don't know
the first thing about computers.

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,760
The most I do is occasionally
check my own videos.

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,640
What? You mean you don't write
your own posts on social media?

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,470
This guy writes all of them.

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,140
What?

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,430
Since we spend so much time together,
I can guess what he'd say.

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,290
If I really got into it, it'd get out of hand.

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,030
Actually, sometimes you get flamed pretty—

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,000
Enough about that.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,410
Any idea who it might be?

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,900
Don't tell my wife.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,040
I don't want to put anymore
emotional strain on her.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,210
You know who it is?

31
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,370
A secret lovechild.

32
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,750
It's not a secret anymore, though.

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,150
And I only have one child
outside my marriage.

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,380
A man who grew up a long time ago.

35
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,550
Hello.

36
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,450
Why is this happening?

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,730
It's not my fault, right?

38
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,680
Hello?

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,670
What? Odokawa-san's...

40
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,020
My place has been empty.

41
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,310
Once you're out of the hospital,
you need to stop by for drinks.

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,310
Excuse us.

43
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,250
What? Rena-chan?

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,130
Sorry, who are you?

45
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,810
The rabbit from Imai-san's cabaret club.

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,210
I think you called me a Polish.

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,280
Oh, right.

48
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,120
Do you remember who you
drove on October 4th?

49
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,100
That girl from Mystery Kiss. The black cat.

50
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,660
Is this her?

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,700
I don't know. It doesn't match up
with people's faces.

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,460
Do you not remember Wadagaki Sakura's face?

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,050
Rena-chan, that's enough. I don't
want to cause him anymore trouble.

54
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,440
But if Odokawa-san is the only witness—

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,330
It's okay. I'll protect Odokawa-sama.

56
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,930
I owe him for getting my billion yen back.

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,400
You can count on me. Okay?

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,000
This is what I've investigated...

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,790
I summarized everything
I know about Yuki.

60
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,990
Huh.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,450
Look at this right here.

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,410
See? It went out.

63
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,960
You're trying to say someone entered
the office before them, right?

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,840
Yes.

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,710
You can certainly see a silhouette, but...

66
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,980
I saw the news.

67
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,260
They say something might've
happened before Nikaido arrived.

68
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,210
You mean someone else might've killed her.

69
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,080
This backs up the time Nikaido gave, huh?

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,770
Isn't Nikaido Rui saying the same thing?

71
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,310
She's got nerves of steel.
She's never changed her story.

72
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,900
She hasn't committed murder. Am I wrong?

73
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,190
Abandoning a body is still a crime.

74
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,150
Someone else killed Yuki.

75
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,030
There's the messages Donraku-san received
and Odokawa-san's testimony.

76
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,520
They should be on the dash
cam data you collected, too.

77
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,820
Wadagaki Sakura said on TV
that she's looking for her father.

78
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,760
Hang on, do you really think this
is something you can figure out?

79
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,490
That driver has visual agnosia, doesn't he?

80
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,170
That casts doubt on his eyewitness testimony.

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,430
But we've brought you evidence.

82
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,650
Okay.

83
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,530
We're getting nowhere. Let's go, Rena-san.

84
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,940
We've already got plenty of evidence,
so take this with you.

85
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,030
Thank you.

86
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,830
I told you, you don't have to come with me.

87
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,760
If someone were trying to kill me,
I'd already be dead.

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,930
Then I'll hire a bodyguard for you
for as long as I can afford it.

89
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,650
I won't be able to work with a bodyguard.

90
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,280
I appreciate everything you've done,
but leave me alone.

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Will she really come?

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,940
It's worth a shot.

93
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,780
I'll be waiting at this plaza on
 January 10th. -Donraku

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,590
Are you sick?

95
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,010
Don't you have a bad feeling about this?

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,600
Remember that analysis we asked
Sekido-san to run the other day?

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,550
What?

98
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,380
On Wadagaki's cat food.

99
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,860
Oh, right. The one full of fertilizer?

100
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,840
Yeah, that.

101
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,110
I licked a little while I was on a stakeout.

102
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,610
What are you doing?

103
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,750
Actually, I ate it.

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,810
Dad!

105
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,820
She's here.

106
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,490
What?

107
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,110
Wadagaki.

108
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,100
Dad.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,170
You're not him.

110
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,420
Wadagaki-san.

111
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,790
Rena-chan? What are you doing here?

112
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,610
I came to stop you.

113
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,320
Stop me? From doing what?

114
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,480
It's not too late to turn back.

115
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,280
Where's my dad? Where's Donraku-san?

116
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
I just wanted to meet him once.

117
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,050
He doesn't remember you.

118
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,730
I see. I've heard he
has kids all over the place.

119
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,850
But Donraku's only daughter was Yuki.

120
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,590
Has he forgotten about me?

121
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,820
He didn't forget about you.

122
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,920
Listen, Wadagaki-san.
I don't have parents, either.

123
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,030
But I've managed somehow. You could still—

124
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,100
You're not even an idol. You're nothing.

125
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,190
I have to do whatever it takes
to make my dream come true.

126
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,320
It already came true.

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,500
Not yet. I need to make sure.

128
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,680
So you're okay with killing people?

129
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,010
That's what my mom said, though.

130
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,620
That I'd make a good idol.

131
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,910
What?

132
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,770
Stay out of my way.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Watch out!

134
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,590
Hey! Sato! Sato!

135
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,910
Wait!

136
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,440
Hurry up, hurry up!

137
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,300
Wait! Wait!

138
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,280
Hello, Mom?

139
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,640
I thought I'd get to see Dad,
but it didn't work out.

140
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,300
Dad?

141
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,710
Isn't my dad Donraku-san?
The rakugo storyteller.

142
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,000
I finally got in touch with him.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,760
There you go again.

144
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,610
More importantly,
I saw you on TV again today.

145
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,600
You should go back to
wearing the purple outfit.

146
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,950
I understand you don't want
to talk about it, but...

147
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,690
I don't want to hear about Donraku.

148
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
I knew it.

149
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,490
Have you forgotten?

150
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,290
I've been saying that for your sake,
so why are you digging up the past now?

151
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
What?

152
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,770
Your dad left us because he admired Donraku.

153
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,320
Seeing Donraku reminded you of
your father. It's hard for me, too.

154
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,000
You understand that, don't you?
He left me to take care of you by myself.

155
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,290
Hey Mom, that can't be right!

156
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,920
Enough! No more of this talk.

157
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,920
Why do you think I let you go to Tokyo?

158
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,610
It certainly wasn't to look for your father!

159
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,980
I entrusted all my dreams to you.

160
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,250
I'm disappointed.

161
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,390
Yeah, I transferred to a bigger agency.

162
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,140
Yeah. Things are going so well,
it's almost scary.

163
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,730
At first, I hounded the manager
after I failed an audition.

164
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,270
Thinking about it now makes me laugh.

165
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,660
I was frustrated, though.

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,690
If they hadn't become famous after that,
I think I would've been content.

167
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,690
But when I heard they'd be making their
major debut, I couldn't sit still anymore.

168
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,100
Yeah, everything's going well.

169
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,810
All I headed out to do was find the taxi
I rode in then, but I think I found it.

170
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,240
It was a total coincidence.
I must be lucky after all.

171
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,950
Everything's going my way.

172
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,550
Like you said, I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to make my dream come true.

173
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,360
Excuse me. This road is closed to traffic.

174
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,370
Closed to Traffic

175
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,370
Detour

176
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,830
Hello.

177
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,040
Long time, no see.

178
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,210
Where have you been?

179
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,480
Uh, in the hospital? I've got a bad back.

180
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,350
You still owe us a lot of money.

181
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,280
I'll pay you this week.

182
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,920
Let's go.

183
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,050
Wait.

184
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,810
I promise I'll pay you back
by the end of the month.

185
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,960
Where to?

186
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,980
Where to?

187
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,010
It suddenly started raining that day, too.

188
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,000
I hopped into the first taxi I saw.

189
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,810
You don't remember me?

190
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,940
Sorry.

191
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,650
It's fine. I just thought you'd
 freak out a little more.

192
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,640
So, where to?

193
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,720
Here's fine.

194
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,180
"Here's fine"?

195
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,090
Yeah, here's fine.

196
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:12,070
The city's full of cameras, you know?

197
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,380
Cameras?

198
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,470
Where's the guy with the money?

199
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,560
He'll be here soon. Yup.

200
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,490
Shut your face.

201
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,830
You're not making any sense.

202
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,900
All I've got is my good luck.

203
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,770
Oh, yeah? I'm lucky, too.

204
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,450
Then it's my luck against your luck.

205
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,440
Odokawa, I gotta ask you for a—

206
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,250
What? Hey, wait!

207
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,640
When he saw his taxi driver friend
being attacked by a suspicious person,

208
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,620
Letter of Appreciation
Kakihana Eiji-dono

209
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,620
he risked his life to defend—

210
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,490
Nice work.

211
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,590
I came today because
I'm quitting the agency soon.

212
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,600
It's all there. Are you
paying for this yourself?

213
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,640
Thank you for everything you've done.

214
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,900
Anyway, I'd like to dispose of the GPS
and stuff you installed for me before.

215
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Oh, crap. I forgot about that.

216
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,020
I already took care of it.

217
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,070
I can't believe you turned it in
to the police as evidence.

218
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,300
I'm getting reamed from all directions
because of you two.

219
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,900
I'm really sorry.

220
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,370
Sorry.

221
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,990
By the way, did you look through
all the data I gave you before?

222
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,490
From the dead high school girl's phone.

223
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,460
No. I thought it would be too painful.

224
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,160
But there's something you've
gotta do before you quit.

225
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,670
What?

226
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,440
He's stubborn, isn't he?

227
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,010
He never listens to me.

228
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,870
You're really not going to do it?

229
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,380
Is the naming really that big a deal?

230
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,260
I'm just reaping what I sowed.

231
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,940
I doubt the world will forgive me.

232
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,920
Who cares about the world?

233
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,190
You should do what you want.

234
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,970
I think Yuki would be sad to hear that.

235
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,160
I've got too many things I can't say.

236
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,690
In public I act like I say whatever I want,

237
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,530
but I had too many secrets
I didn't want Yuki to know.

238
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,270
I wish I could've talked to her more
while she was still alive.

239
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,650
This is the data that was on Yuki's phone.

240
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,430
I think you could wait to decide
until after you've seen it.

241
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,650
Can you see me?

242
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,380
Can you see me?

243
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,910
Wow, what a personal question.

244
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,680
My family is... kind of complicated.

245
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,850
My dad is a distinguished man, and
my mom basically raised me on her own.

246
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,390
That makes her pretty great, too.

247
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,680
Since coming to Tokyo, I've had more
opportunities to spend time with him.

248
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,760
I really wish we could all live together.

249
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,060
There's always been distance
between us and my dad,

250
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,350
and my mom and I used to fight
about it all the time.

251
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:45,510
Once, my mom was so angry that she only
put rice and pickled plums in my lunch.

252
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,080
My dad's experienced a lot
of twists along his road, but...

253
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,460
I've seen how he keeps
plugging along despite it.

254
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:12,080
Now I wish I could see
the same sights he does,

255
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,560
and I'd be happy if he worked even harder

256
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,820
to show our family even
more incredible sights.

257
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,580
If you ever feel like coming back,
we'd love to have you.

258
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,810
I'm off.

259
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,910
See you later.

260
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,670
Rena-san!

261
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,670
You're quitting? For real?

262
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,130
For real, yeah.

263
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,990
Will I ever see you again?

264
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,730
Oh, right. Are you interested in rakugo?

265
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,230
What?

266
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,310
Shofutei Hiraku

267
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,330
Hey, we're sitting next to each other! Nice!

268
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,880
Yeah, because I bought the tickets together.

269
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,380
Sorry I'm late.

270
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,500
I managed to finish up and make it here.

271
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,610
Thank you.

272
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,750
What? It's not just us today?

273
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,770
What? I was originally supposed
to go with just Rena-chan.

274
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,390
Hello!

275
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,620
Nice to meet you. You're so cute!

276
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,620
Wow, looks like everyone's here.

277
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,020
Shall we?

278
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,450
I guess I'll sit—

279
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,350
Oof.

280
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,160
Excuse me, Rena-san.

281
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,910
Our seats are great.

282
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,310
Yeah.

283
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,180
Shofutei
Hiraku

284
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,990
All day and night, the news has been
digging into my family matters,

285
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,090
so I didn't think anyone would show up today.

286
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,880
But if this many of you have gathered here,

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,190
then it's like they say. Another man's
misfortune is like honey.

288
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:00,400
Looks like a lot of people
wanted to see Donraku squirm.

289
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,080
No, wait. I'm not Donraku anymore.

290
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,720
I've been given the great
name of Shofutei Hiraku.

291
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,430
That makes me the third.

292
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,380
I've been named a tomena of my school.

293
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,250
A tomena is the biggest name within
a school. The final destination.

294
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,230
So all that's left is for the name to die.

295
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,330
Hey, Hiraku!

296
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,640
Thank you.

297
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:32,330
It used to be that out of "drink,
play, buy," I used to do all three.

298
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,070
Because of that, people would tease me

299
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,360
by saying the characters in my
name meant I fall into my drink.

300
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,490
But now, I'm clean. I'm all clean.

301
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:51,050
A lot of people used to say my
drinking would get me into trouble.

302
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,710
People say all kinds of things,
like alcohol is an addiction,

303
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,570
it's the best medicine,
it'll take years off your life.

304
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,490
But when it becomes a bad habit,
it destroys everything around you.

305
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,300
There used to be a man named Kumagoro.
He was a skilled carpenter.

306
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,950
He was a good person
as long as he didn't drink.

307
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,570
One day he headed out to a funeral
at a temple in Sanya.

308
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,940
Typically they don't
serve alcohol at funerals,

309
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,720
but accommodating temples will
serve alcohol and call it "hannyato."

310
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,700
He had too much of the stuff
and got good and drunk.

311
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,220
Feeling magnanimous, he decided
to head out to Yoshiwara,

312
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,840
where he got to know a working girl.

313
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,930
He had a wife and kid at home,
so naturally, it led to nonstop fighting.

314
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,720
Why don't you settle down and come back?

315
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,050
We can get remarried.

316
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,780
This is a difficult time for her, too.

317
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,460
Hey, I'm actually dealing
with something right now.

318
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,090
I'm sorry, Yuki. Were we too loud?

319
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,890
No. I'm just going out for a walk.

320
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,860
At this hour? You'll turn into a delinquent.

321
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,150
You're one to talk.

322
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,470
Well, you got me there.

323
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,740
My friend said she has
something important to discuss.

324
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,070
I'll be right back.

325
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,180
Be careful!

326
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,100
Okay!

327
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,720
You can't just act like her father
out of nowhere.

328
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,710
You don't have to put it like that.

329
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,710
Sheesh.

330
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,010
After all the selfish crap I've done,
I'm in no position to say this,

331
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:28,860
but if you want, I'd like the three of us
to live together again like family.

332
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,690
I'm begging you.

333
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,110
Are you serious? Really?

334
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,860
Thank you. I couldn't ask for better.
I'd given up on you.

335
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:58,790
Kame-chan, Dad's gonna
come back home for you.

336
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,820
The three of us can live together again.

337
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:08,870
They say children are the clamp that
holds a couple together, but I guess it's true.

338
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,540
What? I'm a clamp?

339
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,640
Oh, I get it now. That's why you said
you'll hit me on the head with a hammer.

340
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,150
That's time. Please set
your writing implements down.

341
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,970
This show is a work of fiction.
