1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,320
When did you receive these messages?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,360
Just yesterday.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,440
She's claiming to be his
18-year-old biological child.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,680
This is a threat.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,160
She wants to meet in person to confirm their
relationship, or she'll ruin the performance.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,460
Scary.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,930
We've experienced weird messages
and unhinged fans before,

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,590
but this isn't a good time for that.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,470
You need the police or a lawyer.
We can't do anything for you.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,360
We've received a ton
of nonsensical messages.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,560
The police think it's some kind of prank
and won't do anything about it.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,750
There's nothing they can do if it's
just threats to ruin the show.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,610
Since Yuki's death, I've been receiving
more messages slandering me.

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,990
The entertainment industry sounds rough.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,830
But thankfully, we've been getting more
supportive and encouraging messages as well.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,330
People have always sent me their thoughts
on my shows or new rakugo scripts.

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,600
But this is no joke.

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,380
I guess the silver lining is that I don't know
the first thing about computers.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,760
The most I do is occasionally
check my own videos.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,640
What? You mean you don't write
your own posts on social media?

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,470
This guy writes all of them.

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,140
What?

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,430
Since we spend so much time together,
I can guess what he'd say.

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,290
If I really got into it, it'd get out of hand.

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,030
Actually, sometimes you get flamed pretty—

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,000
Enough about that.

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,410
Any idea who it might be?

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,900
Don't tell my wife.

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,040
I don't want to put anymore
emotional strain on her.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,210
You know who it is?

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,370
A secret lovechild.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,750
It's not a secret anymore, though.

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,150
And I only have one child
outside my marriage.

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,380
A man who grew up a long time ago.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,550
Hello.

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,450
Why is this happening?

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,730
It's not my fault, right?

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,680
Hello?

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,670
What? Odokawa-san's...

40
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,020
My place has been empty.

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,310
Once you're out of the hospital,
you need to stop by for drinks.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,310
Excuse us.

43
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,250
What? Rena-chan?

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,130
Sorry, who are you?

45
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,810
The rabbit from Imai-san's cabaret club.

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,210
I think you called me a Polish.

47
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,280
Oh, right.

48
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,120
Do you remember who you
drove on October 4th?

49
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,100
That girl from Mystery Kiss. The black cat.

50
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,660
Is this her?

51
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,700
I don't know. It doesn't match up
with people's faces.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,460
Do you not remember Wadagaki Sakura's face?

53
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,050
Rena-chan, that's enough. I don't
want to cause him anymore trouble.

54
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,440
But if Odokawa-san is the only witness—

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,330
It's okay. I'll protect Odokawa-sama.

56
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,930
I owe him for getting my billion yen back.

57
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,400
You can count on me. Okay?

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
This is what I've investigated...

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,790
I summarized everything
I know about Yuki.

60
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,990
Huh.

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,450
Look at this right here.

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,410
See? It went out.

63
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,960
You're trying to say someone entered
the office before them, right?

64
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,840
Yes.

65
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,710
You can certainly see a silhouette, but...

66
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,980
I saw the news.

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,260
They say something might've
happened before Nikaido arrived.

68
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,210
You mean someone else might've killed her.

69
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,080
This backs up the time Nikaido gave, huh?

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,770
Isn't Nikaido Rui saying the same thing?

71
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,310
She's got nerves of steel.
She's never changed her story.

72
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,900
She hasn't committed murder. Am I wrong?

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,190
Abandoning a body is still a crime.

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,150
Someone else killed Yuki.

75
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,030
There's the messages Donraku-san received
and Odokawa-san's testimony.

76
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,520
They should be on the dash
cam data you collected, too.

77
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,820
Wadagaki Sakura said on TV
that she's looking for her father.

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,760
Hang on, do you really think this
is something you can figure out?

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,490
That driver has visual agnosia, doesn't he?

80
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,170
That casts doubt on his eyewitness testimony.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,430
But we've brought you evidence.

82
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,650
Okay.

83
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,530
We're getting nowhere. Let's go, Rena-san.

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,940
We've already got plenty of evidence,
so take this with you.

85
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,030
Thank you.

86
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,830
I told you, you don't have to come with me.

87
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,760
If someone were trying to kill me,
I'd already be dead.

88
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,930
Then I'll hire a bodyguard for you
for as long as I can afford it.

89
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,650
I won't be able to work with a bodyguard.

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,280
I appreciate everything you've done,
but leave me alone.

91
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,120
Will she really come?

92
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,940
It's worth a shot.

93
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,780
I'll be waiting at this plaza on
 January 10th. -Donraku

94
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,590
Are you sick?

95
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,010
Don't you have a bad feeling about this?

96
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,600
Remember that analysis we asked
Sekido-san to run the other day?

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,550
What?

98
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,380
On Wadagaki's cat food.

99
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,860
Oh, right. The one full of fertilizer?

100
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,840
Yeah, that.

101
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,110
I licked a little while I was on a stakeout.

102
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,610
What are you doing?

103
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,750
Actually, I ate it.

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,810
Dad!

105
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,820
She's here.

106
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,490
What?

107
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,110
Wadagaki.

108
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,100
Dad.

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,170
You're not him.

110
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,420
Wadagaki-san.

111
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,790
Rena-chan? What are you doing here?

112
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,610
I came to stop you.

113
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,320
Stop me? From doing what?

114
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,480
It's not too late to turn back.

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,280
Where's my dad? Where's Donraku-san?

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,000
I just wanted to meet him once.

117
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,050
He doesn't remember you.

118
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,730
I see. I've heard he
has kids all over the place.

119
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,850
But Donraku's only daughter was Yuki.

120
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,590
Has he forgotten about me?

121
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,820
He didn't forget about you.

122
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,920
Listen, Wadagaki-san.
I don't have parents, either.

123
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,030
But I've managed somehow. You could still—

124
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,100
You're not even an idol. You're nothing.

125
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,190
I have to do whatever it takes
to make my dream come true.

126
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,320
It already came true.

127
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,500
Not yet. I need to make sure.

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,680
So you're okay with killing people?

129
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,010
That's what my mom said, though.

130
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,620
That I'd make a good idol.

131
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,910
What?

132
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,770
Stay out of my way.

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Watch out!

134
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,590
Hey! Sato! Sato!

135
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,910
Wait!

136
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,440
Hurry up, hurry up!

137
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,300
Wait! Wait!

138
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,280
Hello, Mom?

139
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,640
I thought I'd get to see Dad,
but it didn't work out.

140
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,300
Dad?

141
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,710
Isn't my dad Donraku-san?
The rakugo storyteller.

142
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,000
I finally got in touch with him.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,760
There you go again.

144
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,610
More importantly,
I saw you on TV again today.

145
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,600
You should go back to
wearing the purple outfit.

146
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,950
I understand you don't want
to talk about it, but...

147
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,690
I don't want to hear about Donraku.

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
I knew it.

149
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,490
Have you forgotten?

150
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,290
I've been saying that for your sake,
so why are you digging up the past now?

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
What?

152
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,770
Your dad left us because he admired Donraku.

153
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,320
Seeing Donraku reminded you of
your father. It's hard for me, too.

154
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,000
You understand that, don't you?
He left me to take care of you by myself.

155
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,290
Hey Mom, that can't be right!

156
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,920
Enough! No more of this talk.

157
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,920
Why do you think I let you go to Tokyo?

158
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,610
It certainly wasn't to look for your father!

159
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,980
I entrusted all my dreams to you.

160
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,250
I'm disappointed.

161
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,390
Yeah, I transferred to a bigger agency.

162
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,140
Yeah. Things are going so well,
it's almost scary.

163
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,730
At first, I hounded the manager
after I failed an audition.

164
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,270
Thinking about it now makes me laugh.

165
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,660
I was frustrated, though.

166
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,690
If they hadn't become famous after that,
I think I would've been content.

167
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,690
But when I heard they'd be making their
major debut, I couldn't sit still anymore.

168
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,100
Yeah, everything's going well.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,810
All I headed out to do was find the taxi
I rode in then, but I think I found it.

170
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,240
It was a total coincidence.
I must be lucky after all.

171
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,950
Everything's going my way.

172
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,550
Like you said, I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to make my dream come true.

173
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,360
Excuse me. This road is closed to traffic.

174
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,370
Closed to Traffic

175
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,370
Detour

176
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,830
Hello.

177
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,040
Long time, no see.

178
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,210
Where have you been?

179
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,480
Uh, in the hospital? I've got a bad back.

180
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,350
You still owe us a lot of money.

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,280
I'll pay you this week.

182
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,920
Let's go.

183
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,050
Wait.

184
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,810
I promise I'll pay you back
by the end of the month.

185
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,960
Where to?

186
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,980
Where to?

187
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,010
It suddenly started raining that day, too.

188
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,000
I hopped into the first taxi I saw.

189
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,810
You don't remember me?

190
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,940
Sorry.

191
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,650
It's fine. I just thought you'd
 freak out a little more.

192
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,640
So, where to?

193
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,720
Here's fine.

194
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,180
"Here's fine"?

195
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,090
Yeah, here's fine.

196
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:11,070
The city's full of cameras, you know?

197
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,380
Cameras?

198
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,470
Where's the guy with the money?

199
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,560
He'll be here soon. Yup.

200
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,490
Shut your face.

201
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,830
You're not making any sense.

202
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,900
All I've got is my good luck.

203
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,770
Oh, yeah? I'm lucky, too.

204
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,450
Then it's my luck against your luck.

205
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,440
Odokawa, I gotta ask you for a—

206
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,250
What? Hey, wait!

207
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,640
When he saw his taxi driver friend
being attacked by a suspicious person,

208
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,620
Letter of Appreciation
Kakihana Eiji-dono

209
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,620
he risked his life to defend—

210
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,490
Nice work.

211
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,590
I came today because
I'm quitting the agency soon.

212
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,600
It's all there. Are you
paying for this yourself?

213
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,640
Thank you for everything you've done.

214
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,900
Anyway, I'd like to dispose of the GPS
and stuff you installed for me before.

215
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Oh, crap. I forgot about that.

216
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,020
I already took care of it.

217
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,070
I can't believe you turned it in
to the police as evidence.

218
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm getting reamed from all directions
because of you two.

219
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,900
I'm really sorry.

220
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,370
Sorry.

221
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,990
By the way, did you look through
all the data I gave you before?

222
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,490
From the dead high school girl's phone.

223
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,460
No. I thought it would be too painful.

224
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,160
But there's something you've
gotta do before you quit.

225
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,670
What?

226
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,440
He's stubborn, isn't he?

227
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,010
He never listens to me.

228
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,870
You're really not going to do it?

229
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,380
Is the naming really that big a deal?

230
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,260
I'm just reaping what I sowed.

231
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,940
I doubt the world will forgive me.

232
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,920
Who cares about the world?

233
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,190
You should do what you want.

234
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,970
I think Yuki would be sad to hear that.

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,160
I've got too many things I can't say.

236
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,690
In public I act like I say whatever I want,

237
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,530
but I had too many secrets
I didn't want Yuki to know.

238
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,270
I wish I could've talked to her more
while she was still alive.

239
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,650
This is the data that was on Yuki's phone.

240
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,430
I think you could wait to decide
until after you've seen it.

241
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,650
Can you see me?

242
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,380
Can you see me?

243
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,910
Wow, what a personal question.

244
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,680
My family is... kind of complicated.

245
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,850
My dad is a distinguished man, and
my mom basically raised me on her own.

246
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,390
That makes her pretty great, too.

247
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:20,680
Since coming to Tokyo, I've had more
opportunities to spend time with him.

248
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,760
I really wish we could all live together.

249
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,060
There's always been distance
between us and my dad,

250
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,350
and my mom and I used to fight
about it all the time.

251
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:44,510
Once, my mom was so angry that she only
put rice and pickled plums in my lunch.

252
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,080
My dad's experienced a lot
of twists along his road, but...

253
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:03,460
I've seen how he keeps
plugging along despite it.

254
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:11,080
Now I wish I could see
the same sights he does,

255
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,560
and I'd be happy if he worked even harder

256
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,820
to show our family even
more incredible sights.

257
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,580
If you ever feel like coming back,
we'd love to have you.

258
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,810
I'm off.

259
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,910
See you later.

260
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,670
Rena-san!

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,670
You're quitting? For real?

262
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,130
For real, yeah.

263
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,990
Will I ever see you again?

264
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,730
Oh, right. Are you interested in rakugo?

265
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,230
What?

266
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,310
Shofutei Hiraku

267
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,330
Hey, we're sitting next to each other! Nice!

268
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,880
Yeah, because I bought the tickets together.

269
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,380
Sorry I'm late.

270
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,500
I managed to finish up and make it here.

271
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,610
Thank you.

272
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,750
What? It's not just us today?

273
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,770
What? I was originally supposed
to go with just Rena-chan.

274
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,390
Hello!

275
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,620
Nice to meet you. You're so cute!

276
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,620
Wow, looks like everyone's here.

277
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,020
Shall we?

278
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,450
I guess I'll sit—

279
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,350
Oof.

280
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,160
Excuse me, Rena-san.

281
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,910
Our seats are great.

282
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,310
Yeah.

283
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,180
Shofutei
Hiraku

284
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,990
All day and night, the news has been
digging into my family matters,

285
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,090
so I didn't think anyone would show up today.

286
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,880
But if this many of you have gathered here,

287
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,190
then it's like they say. Another man's
misfortune is like honey.

288
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,400
Looks like a lot of people
wanted to see Donraku squirm.

289
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,080
No, wait. I'm not Donraku anymore.

290
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,720
I've been given the great
name of Shofutei Hiraku.

291
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,430
That makes me the third.

292
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,380
I've been named a tomena of my school.

293
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,250
A tomena is the biggest name within
a school. The final destination.

294
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,230
So all that's left is for the name to die.

295
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,330
Hey, Hiraku!

296
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,640
Thank you.

297
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:31,330
It used to be that out of "drink,
play, buy," I used to do all three.

298
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,070
Because of that, people would tease me

299
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,360
by saying the characters in my
name meant I fall into my drink.

300
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,490
But now, I'm clean. I'm all clean.

301
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:50,050
A lot of people used to say my
drinking would get me into trouble.

302
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,710
People say all kinds of things,
like alcohol is an addiction,

303
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,570
it's the best medicine,
it'll take years off your life.

304
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,490
But when it becomes a bad habit,
it destroys everything around you.

305
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,300
There used to be a man named Kumagoro.
He was a skilled carpenter.

306
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,950
He was a good person
as long as he didn't drink.

307
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,570
One day he headed out to a funeral
at a temple in Sanya.

308
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,940
Typically they don't
serve alcohol at funerals,

309
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,720
but accommodating temples will
serve alcohol and call it "hannyato."

310
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,700
He had too much of the stuff
and got good and drunk.

311
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,220
Feeling magnanimous, he decided
to head out to Yoshiwara,

312
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,840
where he got to know a working girl.

313
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,930
He had a wife and kid at home,
so naturally, it led to nonstop fighting.

314
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,720
Why don't you settle down and come back?

315
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,050
We can get remarried.

316
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,780
This is a difficult time for her, too.

317
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,460
Hey, I'm actually dealing
with something right now.

318
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,090
I'm sorry, Yuki. Were we too loud?

319
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,890
No. I'm just going out for a walk.

320
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,860
At this hour? You'll turn into a delinquent.

321
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,150
You're one to talk.

322
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,470
Well, you got me there.

323
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,740
My friend said she has
something important to discuss.

324
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,070
I'll be right back.

325
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,180
Be careful!

326
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,100
Okay!

327
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,720
You can't just act like her father
out of nowhere.

328
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,710
You don't have to put it like that.

329
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,710
Sheesh.

330
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:19,010
After all the selfish crap I've done,
I'm in no position to say this,

331
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:27,860
but if you want, I'd like the three of us
to live together again like family.

332
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,690
I'm begging you.

333
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,110
Are you serious? Really?

334
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,860
Thank you. I couldn't ask for better.
I'd given up on you.

335
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:57,790
Kame-chan, Dad's gonna
come back home for you.

336
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,820
The three of us can live together again.

337
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:07,870
They say children are the clamp that
holds a couple together, but I guess it's true.

338
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,540
What? I'm a clamp?

339
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,640
Oh, I get it now. That's why you said
you'll hit me on the head with a hammer.

340
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,150
That's time. Please set
your writing implements down.

341
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,970
This show is a work of fiction.
