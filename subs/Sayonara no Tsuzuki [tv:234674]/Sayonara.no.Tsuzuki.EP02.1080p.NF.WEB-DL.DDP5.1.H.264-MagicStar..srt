a lot of requests from the students

328
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,541
to turn that space into a café.

329
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,958
[woman] They've asked Student Affairs
to look into it.

330
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,500
A café, huh?

331
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,500
[woman] Mm-hmm.

332
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,458
That's a good idea.

333
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:31,791
-[woman] Mm-hmm.
-[man] Yeah.

334
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:39,416
MARU COFFEE

335
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:47,083
[Saeko] Hello. Akane delivery.

336
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,916
-How's it going?
-[man] Oh.

337
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,458
Whoa!

338
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,000
Uh, these are the Guatemala Antigua
washed beans.

339
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,375
And then, these are the natural beans.

340
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,125
Oh wow. Thank you very much.

341
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,291
Any good?

342
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,750
They're wonderful.

343
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,291
-I guarantee it.
-[laughs]

344
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,333
So I'm running through
the airport screaming, "Yusuke!"

345
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,791
[laughs]

346
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,708
[chuckles] Wow.

347
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:20,250
And, obviously, it's not him.

348
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,250
[man chuckles]

349
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,000
I have this feeling
he's still out there somehow.

350
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,958
-Mm?
-Just 'cause it's Yusuke.

351
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,750
[Saeko laughs] I know.

352
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,666
[sighs]

353
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,000
I wonder what that was.

354
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,833
-How about you, Kengo?
-Hmm?

355
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,583
[Saeko] How are you holding up?

356
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,875
[Kengo] I'm just trying to get by.

357
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,875
All we can do is go on
living without Yusuke.

358
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,958
It's pretty boring though. [chuckles]

359
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,291
[Saeko] Mm.

360
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,875
-Oh, uh…
-[Kengo] Hmm?

361
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,458
So I received a thank-you letter.

362
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,333
The person who got Yusuke's heart

363
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,541
wrote me this thank-you note.

364
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,750
Wow, didn't know they did that.

365
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,333
Yeah. Neither of us know who the other is.

366
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,666
It was a really nice letter
he sent me though.

367
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,625
He sounds like a nice person. Really good.

368
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,208
Well, that's great.

369
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,125
Yeah.

370
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,583
So that, uh…
that made me feel really glad.

371
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:33,958
Mm.

372
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,000
Mm.

373
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:37,958
I mean, you know,

374
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,458
you want it to go to a good person,
don't you?

375
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,750
I guess you do, yeah.

376
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,291
[Saeko] Yeah.

377
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,916
The fact that he sounded so nice,

378
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,000
that really makes me happy.

379
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,500
[Kengo] I bet it does.

380
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,375
Mm-hmm.

381
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,375
[Kengo] Oh. [groans]

382
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,500
You mind, uh, giving it a little drink?

383
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,125
Of course not. I'd love to.

384
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,833
You're used to getting rain
in the afternoon in Hawaii, huh?

385
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,916
That looks good.

386
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,208
Hmm.

387
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,416
The café owner
who's that dead guy's best friend…

388
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,333
Huh?

389
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:43,708
He says that the best way to forget love
is to go out and fall in love again.

390
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,500
You're such a cliché.

391
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:46,708
-Oh?
-[laughs]

392
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,500
Go fall in love. Why not?

393
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:53,208
I mean, it's not like I'm determined never
to fall in love again.

394
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,583
Really?

395
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,375
All right, then.

396
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,083
What kind of guy would you like?

397
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,625
Hmm…

398
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,416
Someone who looks for fun everywhere.

399
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,833
Someone who's optimistic because
that's something I struggle with myself.

400
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:12,250
And someone who's a little bit goofy
in a loveable way.

401
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,166
Someone who's not afraid to talk about
the important things in life.

402
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,166
And someone who is madly in love with me.

403
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,125
You just described Yusuke.

404
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,125
[giggles] Yeah, I did.

405
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,958
[both laugh]

406
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:29,083
-Oh no!
-What are we going to do with you?

407
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,916
[tender piano music playing]

408
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,208
[Saeko] To the person
who sent me the letter,

409
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:37,416
I was told it was okay to send a reply,

410
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,750
so I decided to write to you.

411
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,333
Thank you for your letter.

412
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,541
It made me very happy.

413
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,625
I read it over and over again every day.

414
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,541
TO THE ONE WHO READS THIS LETTER

415
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,708
It cheers me up every time.

416
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,666
Reading it gives me strength.

417
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,375
Thank you.

418
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,958
Your letter is very precious to me.

419
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,833
How are you doing healthwise?

420
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:26,333
Is the heart of the person I loved so much
still beating the way it should?

421
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,416
Maybe I shouldn't be
writing things like this…

422
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,583
but I always thought
his heart was a little mischievous.

423
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,166
I hope it's not getting you into trouble.

424
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,333
I truly

425
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,750
and sincerely wish you well

426
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,833
from the bottom of my heart.

427
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,625
I know that we will probably never meet.

428
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,500
Let's both do our best to get through it.

429
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,041
Stay well.

430
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:09,958
Take care.

431
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,958
[tender piano music continues]

432
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
Welcome back.

433
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,416
-[Kazu] Thanks.
-Mm.

434
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,250
[music fades]

435
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,291
And I'm back.

436
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,791
Well, good job, babe.

437
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,625
What's going on?

438
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,625
[chuckles]

439
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,833
I was just thinking…

440
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,833
that I'm so, uh, happy.

441
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,833
[chuckles] Hmm?

442
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,583
[both laugh]

443
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,708
When I got off the train
at the station today,

444
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,291
your car was there,
and you gave me a smile and everything.

445
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,750
And you told me that I'd done well.

446
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,750
Your face was…

447
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,291
[chuckles]

448
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:30,791
…just so pretty.

449
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,625
[laughs]

450
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,166
[laughs]

451
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,208
I thought, "God, I love that woman."

452
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,666
Just thinking how happy I am right now.

453
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,708
I also thought,
"I'm really glad I got better."

454
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,541
Mm. I was thinking that.

455
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,708
All right, then. That's great.

456
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,291
Mm.

457
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,291
It really is.

458
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,375
[wistful music playing]

459
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:02,458
What if we… drove around a while?

460
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,875
What?

461
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,250
Mm-hmm.

462
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,708
[both laugh]

463
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,958
[wistful music continues]

464
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,000
[conductor] Folks, we've received word
that the line ahead is blocked,

465
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,916
so we'll be stopped here for a while.

466
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,500
Sorry for the inconvenience.

467
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,958
[man 1] What? We can't get through?

468
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,916
-[man 2] I can't believe this.
-[woman 1] We're stuck here?

469
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,250
-[man 3] What happened?
-[man 2] I don't know.

470
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,250
[man 4] Seriously?

471
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,208
[man 2] Who knows for how long.

472
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:12,250
-[woman 1] Oh dear.
-[man 1] This isn't good.

473
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,875
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
I need to ask for your patience.

474
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,041
It seems we can't get through up ahead.

475
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,458
I'm sorry about this.

476
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,791
And please feel free
to wait on the platform if you prefer.

477
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,666
[man 4] How long you think it'll be?

478
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,833
[conductor] I think crews are
on their way, but I don't know yet. Sorry.

479
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:36,041
-[man 1] Can't you tell us anything?
-I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

480
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,750
-[man 1] What do you mean you don't know?
-Sorry about that.

481
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,833
-[man 2] This is gonna take forever.
-Sorry, ma'am.

482
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,458
It's not a problem.

483
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:47,875
What?

484
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,375
[grunts]

485
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,125
[sighs]

486

[indistinct chattering]

487
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,416
[man 1] The signal's weak out here too.

488
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,208
[Kazu] Oh, I thought I'd make some coffee.

489
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,125
[woman 1] Hello?

490
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:21,916
Hello?

491
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,166
[indistinct chattering]

492
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,666
[indistinct chattering]

493
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,750
You mind if I help with that?

494
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,125
Huh?

495
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,375
Oh, thank you.

496
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,541
Uh, okay,
so I think we'll use these for the--

497
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh, it's fine, I got it.

498
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,916
Okay, thank you.

499
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,333
This is nice.

500
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,250
I know, right?

501
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,208
Actually, I just
bought all of this yesterday.

502
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,541
I knew it was good.
I wanted it the minute I saw it.

503
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,500
Didn't think I'd use it
in this kind of situation though.

504
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,666
I feel like coffee's nice
on difficult days like this.

505
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:22,750
Hmm.

506
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,125
Like right now,
everyone seems a little on edge.

507
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,166
[Saeko] Oh?

508
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,583
Yeah.

509
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:39,666
A cup of coffee is not gonna
solve your problems or anything.

510
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,041
But

511
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,041
if you can take a time-out

512
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:50,291
and look at your situation differently,
from a slightly different perspective,

513
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,250
you may realize this isn't so bad.

514
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,541
It could allow you
to find beauty in things.

515
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,666
Things that you didn't even notice before.

516
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,041
Hmm.

517
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,250
[wistful music playing]

518
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:10,083
Coffee really does… have
the… the power to do that.

519
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,833
Coffee has that power.

520
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,833
It really does. Did you know that?

521
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,708
Don't you think?

522
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,875
Mm. Oh, you might be right, actually.

523
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,083
-[Kazu] Mm.
-[chuckles]

524
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,083
[Kazu] I think so.

525
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,708
[heart beating]

526
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,208
[music soars]

527
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,333
[music fades]

528
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,333
[rhythmic pop music playing]

529
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:51,625
[music ends]
