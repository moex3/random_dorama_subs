[gentle acoustic guitar music playing]

2
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,625
-[Kazu] If you'd like some.
-[man 3] Oh, thank you.

3
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,875
-For you too, sir.
-Oh, no. I shouldn't.

4
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,750
-Oh, no. Go ahead.
-Thank you very much for this.

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,750
-[woman 1] It's delicious.
-[woman 2] I know!

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,833
[indistinct chattering]

7
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,791
[Kazu sighs] Thanks for helping.

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:40,833
[Saeko] Sure.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,916
Ah, for you.

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,541
-[Kazu] Thank you.
-Enjoy.

11
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,291
[Kazu sighs]

12
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,666
It's beautiful, isn't it?

13
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,583
Didn't know how beautiful it was out here.

14
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,208
I've taken this train a long time,
but I never noticed.

15
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,583
[Saeko] Me neither.

16
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:13,958
[Kazu] Yeah.

17
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,333
Though I suppose I never got off here.

18
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,875
You think that makes us lucky, then?

19
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,333
It stopped, and then we actually

20
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,583
discovered real beauty out here.

21
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:39,458
[sighs]

22
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,041
Now, uh…

23
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,875
[music fades]

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,458
we've met somewhere before, right?

25
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,416
Huh?

26
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,500
Uh, when was it that I met you?

27
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,166
I don't think we've met before.

28
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,125
Oh, really? This is the first time?

29
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,833
I could've sworn that we've met.

30
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,083
Oh, I'll take that from you.

31
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,000
That's okay.

32
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,416
[Kazu] Oh, no. Well, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,416
Well, um, I wasn't trying to, you know…

34
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,041
-I wasn't trying to--
-Do you have a towel for this?

35
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,125
Oh, the dish towel is in here.

36
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,333
-Got it, thanks.
-Yeah.

37
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,291
Well, thank you for the coffee. [chuckles]

38
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,208
Hey. But wait. I still wanted to talk.

39
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,625
[conductor] Thank you
for all your patience.

40
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,250
I sincerely, sincerely apologize

41
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,375
for taking up all of your valuable time
this morning.

42
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,583
We will depart soon.

43
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,583
Oh…

44
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,166
[conductor] I would also like
to give a big thank-you

45
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,833
to the passenger
who kindly shared his coffee with us.

46
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,958
I was actually moved to tears.

47
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,625
-Now, please be seated. We'll depart soon.
-Thanks!

48
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,333
[woman 1] Oh, hey. Thank you so much!

49
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,750
-[man 1] Thank you.
-Oh, don't.

50
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,083
-[man 2] Thank you for the coffee.
-[man 3] Thank you so much.

51
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,333
-[woman 2] Thank you so much.
-Of course. You're welcome.

52
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,583
[man 4] Thank you so much.

53
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,875
[train alert chimes]

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
[whimsical music playing]

55
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,291
Why don't we call them first and confirm?

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,416
[man 1] Oh, good morning.

57
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,750
[Saeko] Good morning!

58
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,208
[man 2] Okay. Yeah, I'll call them.

59
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,708
[man 1] But double-check the numbers
'cause last time…

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm so sorry I'm late.

61
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,666
-Let's begin.
-[Saeko] Yes.

62
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,333
All right, let's start with dry aroma.

63
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,833
-Right, okay.
-[Saeko] Yes.

64
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,125
[sniffs]

65
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,000
[sniffs]

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,416
[man 3] Please go ahead.

67
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,166
[man 4] I like the light roast
of number three.

68
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,375
It had a very refreshing aftertaste.

69
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,791
[woman 3] It was great
in terms of uniqueness,

70
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,458
but I think it's a touch too bright.

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,875
[woman 4] I prefer

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,041
the darker roast of number one.

73
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,458
[woman 5] I enjoyed
the syrupy sweetness of it.

74
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,916
Like brown sugar.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,416
I also liked the dark roast of number one.
Although, is it missing something?

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,041
I thought it tasted flat,
so let's fine-tune its roast time

77
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,375
to give it more contrast?

78
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,333
[Saeko] This one is quite eccentric.

79
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,333
It's very spicy and complex,
yet it's quite delicious.

80
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,500
[Shinoda] You know,

81
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,625
there's the eccentricity

82
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,458
and there's also the thickness of it,

83
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,333
but it's difficult
to get them both in a cup together.

84
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
With your skills, you can make it work.

85
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,833
[chuckles] Well, look.

86
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,250
Just 'cause you flatter me
doesn't make it possible.

87
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,541
If we can figure this out,
we'll have another flagship product.

88
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,208
And just how are we supposed to do that?

89
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,125
-Hey!
-What?

90
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,041
-I think--
-Yeah?

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,375
Let's think this through once more, hmm?

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,541
-Shinoda.
-Yeah.

93
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,625
Number one or number two?

94
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,166
Which represents us better?

95
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,958
Hmm…

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,375
[music ends]

97
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,625
Number one, I'd say.

98
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,416
[woman 6] I see.

99
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,375
-[groans]
-[woman 6 laughs]

100
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,875
[Saeko] You know what?

101
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,583
On second thought,

102
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:15,083
I realize now that what he said wasn't
exactly the most groundbreaking statement.

103
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,583
So what if he and Yusuke
made the same observation once?

104
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,875
[sighs] I feel stupid.

105
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,708
What was I thinking?

106
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,625
[Kengo sighs]

107
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,083
And he seemed like
a really nice person too.

108
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,041
[inhales sharply]

109
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,916
Uh, I treated him terribly.

110
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,000
When he asked if we had met before,
I completely shut down.

111
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,791
I guess it could be just that
I looked like someone he knew.

112
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,916
I mean, we take the same train together.

113
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,791
I see.

114
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,208
That's it.

115
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,666
Sorry. I have nothing to add to that.

116
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,875
You're a good listener,
so that's already enough.

117
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you serious? I'm just a listener?

118
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,291
You are! In this world,
everyone needs a good listener.

119
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,583
If everyone always said
every single thought…

120
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,083
If there were only people
like me walking around,

121
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,000
this world would be too noisy.

122
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,041
-Really.
-[laughs]

123
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,458
All right. I guess it works out.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,833
Yeah.

125
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,000
Come to think of it,

126
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
I remember you were more of a listener
with Yusuke as well.

127
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,750
[Kengo chuckles]

128
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,333
Was it always like that
since you guys were little?

129
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,291
Basically.

130
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,500
Good to know.

131
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,541

[footsteps approaching]

-What's that?
-[Kazu chuckles]

135
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,333
Wow!

136
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,458
-You know what?
-Hmm?

137
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm glad you can drink coffee now,

138
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,750
especially since
you never liked it before.

139
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,875
But it seems like you didn't just
get over the dislike of coffee.

140
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,916
You really like it now.

141
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,291
Oh, you are right. I think you're right.

142
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,291
Mm-hmm.

143
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,041
So you… you like it, huh?

144
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,083
It's good to explore new passions in life.

145
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,000
-Mm.
-I think it's wonderful.

146
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,083
I just think I'll be sad if you start
disliking things you used to like.

147
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,750
What?

148
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,208
[chuckles softly]

149
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,041
No.

150
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,416
I won't.

151
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,541
I haven't really changed,
and the things I like won't change.

152
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,958
Like my favorite ramen is… still miso.
That won't change.

153
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,625
-I wasn't thinking of that.
-[chuckles]

154
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,166
-I like sauce over my fried eggs.
-[chuckles]

155
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,166
-That won't change either.
-[giggles]

156
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
I heard Miyazaki does too.

157
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,958
-What? Really?
-Yeah.

158
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,333
-Oh, who cares?
-[both laugh]

159
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,708
Let's see, what else?

[wistful music playing]

00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,041
-[Kengo] Maru Coffee!
-[Saeko] I thought it was cute.

163
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,208
[Yusuke] It's so chic and so stylish.
Who came up with this?

164
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,000
-[Saeko] Yeah, who?
-[Kengo] It was Yusuke!

165
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,625
[Saeko and Yusuke laugh]

166
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,125
[Yusuke] Maru means "round."

167
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,916
Or "a circle."

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,750
-Mm.
-'Cause the Earth is round.

169
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,458
Uh, so even if people end up separated,

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,083
they circle back to each other, you know?

171
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,416
That's where "Maru" came from.
Check this out.

172
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,625
[Yusuke laughs]

173
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,291
-[Saeko] What are you doing?
-Hey! What?

174
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,416
It's important that you do it slowly!

175
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
-[Kengo] See?
-No! This will improve it!

176
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,666
-I'm serious. And in circles.
-I told you!

177
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,625
-It turned out good!
-[Kengo] Guess it's not bad.

178
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,916
It's so good. It's so good, right?
You like it, don't you?

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,583
[Kengo and Yusuke] Oh yeah.
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

180
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,875
-[Saeko] No, no, no. You're not there yet.
-[Yusuke] Huh?

181
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:42,958
[Saeko] You're not!

182
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,500
[man 1] Whoa!

183
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,375
[man 2] All right! Here they come!

184
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,833
-[man 3] Woo-hoo!
-Look at that!

185
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,833
Whoa!

186
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,000
[Saeko] Look at it!
They're huge! So pretty!

187
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,291
We love fireworks!

188
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,291
[all] We love fireworks!

189
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,958
Tonight, Saeko, you look so beautiful!

190
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,958
[all cheering]

191
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,791
-[man 4] Here comes another one!
-Whoo!

192
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,625
[Saeko] You'll get sunburned
if you lie down there.

193
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,750
-That's okay. [laughs]
-[Saeko] You sure?

194
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,166
I wanna get a tan.

195
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,416
-Whoa. That's dangerous.
-[Saeko laughs] It is!

196
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,083
[Yusuke] Hey. Can I use it for a second?

197
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,666
The view from here is awesome.

198
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,000
-Look!
-[Kengo] Oh, this is awesome.

199
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,958
-Wow!
-[Yusuke] So cool.

200
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,958
We gotta get some photos by the water.
Come on.

201
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,375
[Kengo] Yusuke.

202
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,708
[Kengo laughs]

203
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,791
[Saeko] Yeah, the view is nice.

204
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,916
[Yusuke] So tell me…

205
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,291
Kengo.

206
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,000
[Saeko] My favorites?

207
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,708
[Kengo] Hmm?

208
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,458
[Saeko] Um, let me think.

209
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,041
Shake my hand.

210
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,208
Yeah? Here.

211
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,000
[Kengo chuckles]

212
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,291
[Saeko giggles]

213
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,625
[both chuckle]

214
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,083
Grow big.

215
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,125
I'm rooting for you.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,958
[laughs]

217
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,625
I was just thinking.

218
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,583
If coffee cherries grow here…

219
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,041
[sighs] …I'll be ecstatic.

220
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,458
Think I'll cry. Yeah.

221
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,375
[laughs]

222
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,583
Ah… Look at it.

223
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,875
Isn't it so cute?

224
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
[wistful music continues]

225
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,000
[music fades]

226
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,666
-[child 1] Those ones are bright red!
-[child 2] Oh, you're right!

227
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,291
-Those ones look good.
-They're pretty.

228
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,250
-[child 2] There are centipedes!
-You see?

229
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,666
-[child 1] Awesome!
-[Kazu laughs]

230
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,583
-Centipedes?
-[child 2] Keep running!

231
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,291
-You guys are fast. Be careful!
-[child 3] We're gonna get bitten!

232
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,541
-Thank you for doing this again this year.
-Oh, hi!

233
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,666
-It's so generous of you.
-We love doing this.

234
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,166
-The kids were so excited to come today.
-That's great to hear.

235
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,583
-Hello. It's wonderful to have you here.
-Oh, hello. Thank you so much.

236
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,750
-[woman 1] Wow! Look at those apples!
-[woman 2] Try them.

237
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,833
-[woman 3] Beautiful.
-[woman 1] They look perfect.

238
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,041
-[child 3] I know!
-Yes!

239
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,875
Because the sunlight
doesn't reach this side.

240
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,125
-That's correct. Well done!
-[child 4] Wow. You're smart.

241
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,041
-Now, you take this…
-[child 5] That's so cool.

242
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,333
…and point it towards the sunlight
like that. That's great!

243
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's clear this area out
so that plenty of sun will reach it.

244
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,125
-[woman 1] Sure. All right.
-[woman 2] Yeah?

245
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,416
[Kazu] Run! Run!

246
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
[children shouting playfully]

247
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,041
[Kazu shouting playfully]

248
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,750
[Kazu] Watch out! Watch out!

249
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,541
Oh, there you are! I'm coming for you!

250
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,208
[playful shouting continues]

251
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,250
[man 1] Watch out!

252
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,000
[ethereal music playing]

253
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:37,916
Miki!

254
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,250
[woman 1] Wow, you all run so fast!

255
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,708
Make sure you wash up before you eat.

256
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,125
[music fades]

257
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,375
Hello.

258
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,708
Yes? You need something?

259
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,500
Um…

260
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,875
Yes. Would you like to date
and get married eventually?

261
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,458
I would be honored.

262
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,166
What?

263
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,666
Uh, I could marry you right now.
I really like you!

264
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,583
[sighs]

265
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,041
I couldn't conceal how I feel any longer.

266
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,916
Yeah, but I don't think

267
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,916
I'm the right guy for you.

268
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
Well, I disagree.

269
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,500
It… it's very flattering.

270
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,083
-However…
-[moans]

271
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,375
Oh God!

272
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,125
No, uh…

273
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,583
Um… it's just that… Well, I'm so plain.

274
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,291
[chuckles] That's fine though.

275
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,125
I'll be the flashy one
when we're together.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,750
-And boring.
-That's all right.

277
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,333
I have a good sense of humor.
You'll see. [giggles]

278
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,541
Yeah, but I'm unreliable,

279
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,291
and I look frail.

280
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,833
Look how little I eat,
even though I'm a man.

281
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,375
[chuckles] That's okay.

282
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,208
I'm tough, dependable,
and I always have a lot to eat.

283
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,750
[both laugh]

284
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,875
Well…

285
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,500
I don't know if you've been told or not…

286
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,416
I have a condition.

287
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,416
A heart condition.

288
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,166
That's okay. My heart is strong enough
for the two of us.

289
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,333
-[chuckles]
-Oh?

290
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,000
[Miki] Hmm?

291
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,458
[chuckles]

292
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,250
[Kazu] I guess I have

293
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,958
no excuse to turn you down.

294
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,875
Because for a long time…

295
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,833
Well, I've had feelings for you too.

296
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,166
Ever since you were Miss Apple.

297
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,208
[Miki] What?

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,833
What? Really?

299
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,500
I can't believe it.

300
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,791
I'd love for us to be together.

301
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,833
[chuckles]

302
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,916
I'd like that as well.

303
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,583
[both laugh]

304
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,916
So is it good?

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,875
[woman 1] Hey, guys!
Does anyone want more?

306
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,583
-[Kazu] I'll take that.
-[woman 1] You want some?

307
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,875
-[child 6] I do! I do!
-[woman 1] There's plenty to share.

308
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,375
-[Kazu] Here comes another plate.
-[woman 1] This one.

309
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,083
-[Kazu] There's plenty more.
-[child 6] Look! I'm a two-way player!

310
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,416
[Kazu] Two-sport style?

311
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,041
[Miki sighs]

312
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,250
Hey.

313
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,750
What is it?

314
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,583
Aren't you just so glad for Naruse?

315
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,625
What do you mean?

316
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,791
Oh, just look at him!

317
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,625
He's so cheerful and full of life.
Isn't he?

318
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,708
[Miki] Stop it.

319
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,166
What? What's wrong?

320
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,458
Of course it's a good thing
that he recovered.

321
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,666
What I mean is, don't say you're glad
he's becoming cheerful.

322
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
It sounds like he wasn't
good enough before.

323
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,250
What? Oh no, I'm not saying that.

324
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,333
Well, you might as well be saying that.

325
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,375
Saying that I fell in love and married him
when he wasn't good enough for you.

326
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,208
It's just insulting.

327
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,541
Oh, is that how that works?

328
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,250
Yes, it is!

329
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,208
Just stop acting so thrilled
that he's become a different person.

330
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,000
I understand.

331
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,250
Well, I'm so glad
that Naruse's become so cheerful.

333
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,041
-Sorry, the teacher asked me…
-He's behaving like a different person.

334
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,416
…if they can come help us again in autumn.

335
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,875
-What?
-One other thing. The kids were saying…

336
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,625
[Kazu laughs]

337
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,833
-Mmm!
-You kids ate a lot.

338
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,083
-It's yummy! Yeah.
-Really? Yeah, good.

339
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
[feel-good music playing]

340
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,333
-[Kazu] Huh? Um--
-I wanna say…

341
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,416
I apologize for the other day.

342
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,125
Oh, don't… don't worry. I was a little--

343
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,208
No. I was the one at fault.

344
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
You didn't do anything wrong.

345
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,708
I couldn't bear to leave it
the way it ended.

346
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,083
I behaved like someone who thinks
everyone's hitting on her.

347
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,833
You didn't deserve that,
especially after you made coffee for us.

348
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,166
And so,
I'm really sorry I ruined everything.

349
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,916
Yeah. Still, I was--

350
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,416
Don't say you were also responsible.
I was the only one in the wrong.

351
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
Okay. I won't, then.

352
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,333
I apologize for how forceful I seem.

353
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,666
[chuckles] Uh, no…

354
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,916
Uh, if you'd like to…

355
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,750
Uh…

356
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,250
[chuckles]

357
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,250
[music fades]

358
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,958
Uh, so… my name is Naruse.

359
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,375
-Ah.
-It's nice to see you again.

360
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,000
And I live in Niseko.

361
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,791
My wife's family
has an apple orchard there.

362
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,125
Oh.

363
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,125
-Well, it's nice to meet you properly.
-Likewise.

364
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,541
I'm Sugawara.

365
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,083
I live near Rankoshi Station.

366
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,583
I actually moved there quite recently.

367
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,291
Oh, so you're actually from Otaru, then?

368
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,833
No. I was born and raised in Tokyo.
My parents are there.

369
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,375
But I went through a lot recently,
so I got a new job and moved here.

370
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,041
Oh, I see.

371
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,958
Uh, what do I do?
I'm dealing with so much.

372
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,875
-Hmm?
-Here's the thing.

373
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,708
I actually have been working
in the coffee business.

374
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,458
Oh!

375
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,666
Yeah.

376
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,708
Wait.

377
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,000
You're saying that you're
a coffee professional?

378
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,291
Uh, yep. You could say that.

379
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,208
Crap! You should've said that earlier

380
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,000
because I was lecturing you
like you were a novice or something.

381
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,750
Well, when would I have told you?

382
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,708
Well, that is true, I guess.

383
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,833
So you know about brewing coffee as well?

384
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,583
Uh, yes, I do.

385
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,791
Oh wow! Are you serious?
Just be honest with me. How did it taste?

386
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,208
Oh, yeah, it was awful.

387
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,125
[both laugh]

388
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,375
-[Kazu] I'm sure it was.
-Yeah.

389
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,291
-[Kazu] How embarrassing.
-[Saeko laughs]

390
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,958
-[Kazu] Sorry about that.
-[Saeko] Oh, that's all right.

391
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,375
I have one piece of advice
to brewing delicious coffee.

392
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,083
Yeah. Go ahead.

393
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,750
So let's say right here,
this is our dripper.

394
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,625
-Mm-hmm.
-Pour a little water slowly at first.

395
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,083
Then, once it's absorbed,

396
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,208
you can pour the rest,
starting from the center.

397
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,125
Huh…

398
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,208
-[Saeko] See you.
-[Kazu] So long.

399
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,625
-[Saeko] Have a good day.
-[Kazu] You too.

400
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
[feel-good music continues]

401
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,625
[student 1] Excuse me.

402
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,291
Uh, yes?

403
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,500
How can I help you?

404
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,583
-Um…
-Hmm?

405
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,166
-I had a question about this.
-Okay.

406
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,750
[student 2] Excuse me.

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,208
Excuse me.

408
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,666
Uh, yeah.

409
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,750
[feel-good music continues]

410
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,916
So I do it like that?

411
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,375
[music ends]

412
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,041
Hey, I have coffee for everyone.

413
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,708
-It's not from a cafe. I made it myself.
-Wait, what's that?

414
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,750
-Oh, he's got coffee!
-Wow! This is great.

415
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,333
-Go ahead. Enjoy.
-Thank you!

416
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,916
-Appreciate it.
-What? Coffee?

417
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,291
-Can I have one?
-Of course.

418
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,791
What's going on here?

419
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,666
-I wanted to try brewing some myself.
-This is so good.

420
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,125
-Is it really?
-I love it. Yeah.

421
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,958
-It's delicious, right? Isn't it?
-It's great.

422
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,458
-[man 1] This is good.
-[woman 1] It's relaxing.

423
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,666
-[woman 2] What a treat!
-[woman 3] Mmm. Wow, it's good!

424
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,166
-[woman 1] It calms you down, right?
-[woman 4] It really does.

425
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,166
[woman 1] It's nice to relax,
take a breather.

426
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,208
It's delicious. [chuckles]

427
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,791
[announcement] The local train
for Oshamambe

428
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,333
will soon be departing from Platform Two.

429
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,875
Please make sure to board in time.

430
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,208
Oh, hey there.

431
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,958
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

432
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,041
What a nice coincidence
seeing you twice in one day.

433
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,416
It only comes once an hour, so… [giggles]

434
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,666
Well, that's true.

435
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,083
-Let's… [chuckles]
-Ah.

436
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,125
[conductor blows whistle]

437
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,166
[train alert chimes]

438
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,875
[melodic pop music playing]

439
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,333
I miss those days.
I wish I could go back. I'm jealous.

440
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,208
Sure, but college kids now
are having it really tough.

441
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,458
Like trying to find work.

442
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,833
So then, why did you want to work
at a coffee company?

443
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,125
[chuckles] It's a long story.
Are you sure?

444
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,458
Yeah. I wanna hear it.

445
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,333
It's an interesting company to work for.

446
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,791
Everybody who works there
has had their life changed by coffee

447
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,291
in some strange way.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,250
Oh…

449
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,583
They owe their lives to coffee, huh?

450
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,791
-Huh…
-[laughs]

451
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,166
Now that I've started,
I kinda wanna tell you more.

452
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,125
What?

453
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,708
[Saeko] I was like, "Let's go farther,"

454
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,166
but they didn't listen to me
and kept saying, "Let's go back."

455
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,208
So I said, "Fine, but I'm going.
Which way is it?"

456
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,875
-Mm. Mm.
-And I started walking.

457
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,750
Then, the next thing I knew,

458
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,750
I was lost somewhere
in the mountains of Costa Rica.

459
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,666
But there was jungle everywhere.

460
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,166
-Wow. That's crazy.
-I was so lost.

461
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,125
It took a while to figure it all out.

462
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,166
[children giggling]

463
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,625
[child 1] Where do you wanna sit?

464
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,041
-[child 2] Over here!
-[Kazu] Here.

465
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,666
[child 1] Wow. This is cool!

466
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,416
They look like they're married.

467
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,250
[child 3] Ah! Ah! You guys are flirting!

468
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,250
-No, we're not.
-[child 4] Are they really?

469
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,916
-No, no. We're not.
-We're not. We're not.

470
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Whoa, whoa. We're not. We're not.

471
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:18,916
-[children chanting] You're in love!
-Knock it off right now! I'm so sorry.

472
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,416
[panting]

473
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,416

Huh?

476
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,333
Good evening.

477
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,375
I wanted to hear the rest of your story.

[sighs]

481
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,958
I accidentally found out
that they're planning to

482
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,666
have a surprise thing for my birthday.

483
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,250
Ah, I think I understand it all now.

484
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,250
When is it?

485
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,500
Well, it's tomorrow.

486
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,625
-Oh.
-But that's not the point of the story.

487
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,125
I overheard it when they were busy
preparing for the surprise.

488
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,083
Mm.

489
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,666
How should I respond to it?

490
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,000
Should I just act surprised, like, "Wow!"
Or something like that?

491
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,125
What would you do?

492
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,375
Mm…

493
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,625
You should act like you didn't know.

494
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,666
Just act excited about it
since that's what they're hoping for.

495
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,916
-Mm. That's what I thought.
-Mm.

496
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,166
Hold on.

497
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,250
Actually, though…

498
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,208
I shouldn't?

499
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,625
That would've been
my usual course of action.

500
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,791
-But you should have fun with it.
-What?

501
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,750
You act like you didn't know,
you're surprised,

502
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,375
you make everyone excited.

503
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:58,375
Then, when everyone is all excited,
you surprise them.

504
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,125
You reveal you knew all about it.

505
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:03,375
You can give small presents
to everyone after that.

506
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,583
That way, everyone has a fun time.

507
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,125
-Huh.
-Mm.

508

I'll surprise them.

511
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,208
I hope it goes well.

512
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:18,541
Yes.

513
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,291
Oh. Then… let me say happy birth--

514
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,541
No, wait a second!

515
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,208
You're not supposed to say
those sorts of things in advance.

516
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,500
If you say it too early,
this whole thing is sure to fail.

Oh, no.

525
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,666
I have

526
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,708
a really strange feeling right now.

527
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm not sure how to say it.

528

-Mm-hmm.

It'll be okay.

But how crazy is it that those two
are down with a fever now?

as often as you want.

And one more thing, Saeko.

You said that it was difficult

Okay?

Mm.

It's not scientifically proven.

However, there have been
several cases reported, correct?

00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,541
of what's going to happen to me though…

643
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,583
I'm scared.

644
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,625
[music fades]

645
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,291
[footsteps approaching]

646
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,583
[Yuma] Uncle! Play with me!

647
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,291
Sure.

648
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,708
What do you wanna play?

649
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:10,000
-[Yuma] Let's play tops!
-Tops?

650
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:10,958
[Kazu] Go!

651
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,625
-[Yuma] Oh?
-[Kazu] Oh crap!

652
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,041
-Yay! I win!
-Oh! You're too good.

653
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,875
-Hey, if I win again…
-Yeah?

654
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,541
…will you do what I say?

655
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,375
What? Sure.

656
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,875
-You ready?
-Mm.

657
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,083
[both] Ready and…

658
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,708
Eh. Ah.

659
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,416
-Yay!
-You're good!

660
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,625
Now you do what I say.

661
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:30,541
All right.

662
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,875
-Okay, so…
-Mm-hmm.

663
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,416
With the surgery,
it's like you're in your second form?

664
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,666
Hmm?

665
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,958
Can you show me the scar?

666
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,416
Uh…

667
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,041
Hey, you promised, so you have to show me.

668
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,416
It's pretty… scary though.
You sure you want to?

669
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,291
No. Don't worry. I won't cry.

670
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,541
You promised.
So it's okay, right? Show it! Show it!

671
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,875
It's okay.

672
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:04,625
-Hmm.
-Really!

673
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,083
I won't cry, okay?

674
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,166
-You sure?
-Mm.

675
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,333
Hmm.

676
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,875
-You ready?
-Yeah.

677
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:36,041
Wow! That looks so cool!

678
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,791
-What?
-It's super cool.

679
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,375
[chuckles]

680
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,208
-Are you sure?
-Yeah!

681
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,208
-You think so?
-Yeah!

682
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,041
All right.

683
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,083
-[rhythmic pop music playing]
-Hey. Let's go see the apples.

684
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,125
Hmm? Right now?

685
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,083
-Yeah.
-Eh, uh…

686
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,125
-Hurry. Let's go! Let's go!
-Wait, just--

687
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,083
Wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

688
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,333
-[Yuma] Come on! Hurry!
-I'm coming.

689
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,333
Careful, Yuma.

690
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,208
You're so fast.

691
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,250
