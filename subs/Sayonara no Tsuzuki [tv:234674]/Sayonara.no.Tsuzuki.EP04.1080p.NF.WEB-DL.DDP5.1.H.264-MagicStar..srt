[tender piano music playing]

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,333
[Yusuke] Okay. There you go.

3
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,333
[Saeko] Thank you.

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,041
Today, around the world,

5
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,125
we should all be celebrating you.

6
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,208
Mm-hmm. Honoring the birth of Saeko.

7
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,791
-[chuckles] Come on.
-[laughs] Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,125
The world's brighter now
because Saeko's here in it.

9
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,791
It's a happier world just
having you exist at all.

10
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:46,916
I'm serious.

11
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:50,791
Thank you

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,500
for being in this world.

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,875
Thank you.

14
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,458
Happy birthday, Saeko.

15
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,083
[softly] Thank you.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,791
[giggles] Ugh! I might cry.

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,916
-Just kidding.
-[both laugh]

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,125
You're kidding?

19
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,041
-You're not crying?
-No.

20
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,291
You have tears in your eyes.
Stop giving me that face.

21
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,375
[both laugh]

22
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,958
[music fades]

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,375
[Kazu] I'm sorry about…

24
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:40,791
Oh.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,875
I'm sorry… about the other day.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,250
I told you I'd be here
to wish you a happy birthday, but I, uh…

27
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,375
[chuckles]

28
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,541
Honestly, I was, uh…
I was kinda looking forward to seeing you.

29
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,375
Oh. I'm really sorry.

30
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,708
I re… I really am… really, really sorry
I didn't make it that day.

31
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,041
It's fine.
You don't have to keep saying sorry.

32
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,708
I wanted you to come,

33
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,041
though, technically,
it wasn't you I wanted to see.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,708
Can I explain something to you?

35
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,416
Okay.

36
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:25,125
It's strange. Sometimes you…
you say things exactly how he would.

37
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,625
A guy I was in love with.

38
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,083
You don't look alike or anything.

39
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,750
You've got different faces.

40
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:40,291
Although… it shocked me
'cause, in some ways, you're so alike.

41
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,750
It's like
I started seeing him in you a little.

42
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,875
It was fun for a while.

43
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,458
I could look forward to… to
us spending time here on the train.

44
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,291
He really was the love of my life.

45
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,416
I'm sure it's better if I stop doing this.
I probably should.

46
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,041
So I'm sorry.

47
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,250
Oh, no. That's…

48
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,166
Why'd you apologize?

49
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,541
You haven't done anything wrong.

50
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,083
I don't like it though.

51
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,708
I do like to think back. All the memories.
But it also makes me sad.

52
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,958
And what if I started
confusing you with him?

53
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,125
And I end up falling for you, huh?

54
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
That wouldn't be very good.

55
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,458
It'd be wrong,
and it'd cause problems for you.

56
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,541
And for me too.

57
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,875
And besides,
you're not even my type at all.

58
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,250
[laughs]

59
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,500
[Kazu] Oh… I see.

60
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,291
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,000
That was really rude of me to say.

62
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,708
That's okay. It's…

63
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, I guess it was.

64
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,291
To be honest, I was thinking
I'd start taking a different train

65
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,958
so we wouldn't see each other.

66
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,333
It wouldn't work, though,

67
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,791
'cause there aren't many
other trains to take.

68
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,666
So we'll just have to make do.

69
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,250
We both can say hi and stuff and be nice

70
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,125
and leave it there.

71
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,375
And nothing else. Just being polite.

72
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,708
Anyway,

73
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,416
thank you for everything.

74
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,666
Uh, hold on.

75
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,125
So this guy…

76
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,833
I, uh…

77
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,541
That's all right.

78
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,750
[chuckles]

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,250
[wistful music playing]

80
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah. So that was it.

81
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,500
[music fades]

82
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,791
Like a mini-love story taking place
over rides on a train

83
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,333
with a guy who kind of reminds the girl
of her late fiancé.

84
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,541
[Kengo laughs]

85
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,791
A love story between you and that guy?

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,916
No. No way. It's not like that at all.

87
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,708
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, of course.

88
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,208
So he was really that much like Yusuke.

89
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:05,958
Oh.

90
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,333
Would you wanna meet him?

91
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,583
No.

92
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,125
No, I wouldn't.

93
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,750
He's not Yusuke.

94
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
No, I guess not. He isn't.

95
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,333
You're right about that.

96
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,958
You gonna be okay?

97
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,791
Hmm? Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

98
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,125
You know,

99
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,458
I just don't want you getting hurt.

100
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,541
You went through a lot.

101
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,791
Mm. Thank you.

102
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,500
[chuckles]

103
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,125
-[Yuma] He's coming. Hurry up!
-[man 1] Hurry, let's go.

104
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,666
-[Kazu] Okay.
-[man 1] We'll get stuck in traffic.

105
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,750
-[Yuma] Come on, hurry!
-Sorry I'm late.

106
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,458
[Yuma] We're gonna miss
the beginning of the fireworks!

107
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,583
[Kazu sighs]

108
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,875
We're really gonna see 'em, aren't we?

109
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,875
[Miki] Mm.

110
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
Just like you said we would.

111
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,416
You said I'd see the fireworks.

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,750
Yeah, I did.

113
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,666
[both laugh]

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,000
-I thank you, ma'am.
-[laughs] You're silly.

115
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,333
[both laugh]

116
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,791
[Yuma] Uncle! Auntie!

117
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,958
[Kazu] Hi!

118
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,208
You know…

119
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,750
[Miki] Hmm?

120
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,250
I told you that

121
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,458
the doctor said that, medically,
there's no explanation for it, right?

122
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,708
[Miki] Mm-hmm.

123
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,291
But I'm still feeling…

124
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,250
feeling someone,

125
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,500
like, inside, this strange feeling.

126
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,541
It hasn't gone away.

127
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,375
I…

128
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, I wonder if this someone is

129
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,791
the one who gave his heart to me.
The reason that I'm still here.

130
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,500
[emotional music playing]

131
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,000
Because it's like…

132
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,458
I really think

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,208
I've got memories of his in my head.

134
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,708
Organ transplant is
still kind of… a mystery.

135
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,000
No one knows what's possible for sure.

136
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,375
The doctor said
there's so much we don't know.

137
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,166
So,

138
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,791
I just gotta keep living like this.

139
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,041
Living with his memories.

140
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,333
And that's it.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,958
[Miki] Hmm.

142
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,791
[Kazu] I'm sorry.

143
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,541
[Miki] Mm.

144
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,750
[chuckles]

145
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,750
There's nothing to apologize for, okay?

146
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,708
Mm.

147
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,000
[Miki] What can you do? You know me.

148
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,541
I'm ready. You need me,
you know I'm here for whatever it is.

149
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,666
Thanks, sweetie,

150
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,000
for your support here.

151
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,583
Mm-hmm. You got it.

152
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,083
Hmm.

153
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,291
-[Miki] Anyway…
-Hmm?

154
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,708
How do I look in this? Huh?

155
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,875
Uh, I'm sorry.

156
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,041
It's just you're so beautiful
I didn't know what to say.

[both laugh]

158
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,875
-What? Well, you better figure it out.
-[laughs] Sorry, sorry.

159
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,000
[man 2] Miki! Thanks for waiting!

160
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:46,916
Come on!

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,958
-Let's go.
-Mm.

[crowd chanting]

163

[announcement] The fireworks show
is about to begin.

164
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,500
The fireworks show…

165
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,166
[Kengo] Ah, finally.

166
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,666
[man 3] Is it starting soon?

167
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,166
[Saeko] Yusuke loved fireworks, didn't he?

168
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,583
[laughs]

169
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:17,208
Oh man, he was the "fireworks are my life"
kind of guy. You know how he was.

170
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,666
[laughs] He was so funny.

171
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,916
Uh-huh. He was like…

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
When he was making his plan
for his proposal…

173
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,416
[laughs]

174
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,791
"Oh my God!
I need fireworks when I propose."

175
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,750
"I gotta do it like, 'Will you marry me?'"

176
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,000
Then, after a beat, just…

177
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,416
"Swoosh! That's the way to go!"

178
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,416
[laughs]

179
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,416
[Kengo] Man, that sure was
a hell of a lot of work. Right, guys?

180
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,125
[all laughing]

181
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,833
[Saeko] Thank you.
Yusuke looked happy too.

182
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,083
The last thing I saw him do was smile

183
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,708
as he watched the fireworks.

184
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,083
That's good though.

185
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,500
Thanks for having me over tonight.

186
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,916
The firework festivals happen every year.

187
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,958
Gotta get used to it.

188
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,166
[sentimental music playing]

189
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,500
[crowd oohing]

190
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,875
[Kazu] Wow! Look at that!

191
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,000
-[Kazu] Aren't they great?
-[Miki] Amazing!

192
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,666
-[woman 1] So pretty!
-[Kazu] Yeah.

193
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,541
[man 4] There they go. Still going.

194
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,208
[Kazu] Here they go! Whoo!

195
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,708
[all exclaim excitedly]

196
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,000
[Miki] Look at the colors!
They're so beautiful!

197
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,958
-[boy] They're so bright!
-[Kazu] Yeah!

198
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,750
[boy] Wow!

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,833
[Miki] It's incredible, right?

200
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,125
How many they do.

201
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,791
-[fireworks explode]
-[crowd exclaims]

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,333
[crowd oohing]

203
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,000
[boy] Wow!

204
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,666
[crowd exclaims]

205
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,333
[boy] So cool!

206
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,083
[sentimental music continues]

207
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,208
[crowd exclaiming]

208
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,041
Oh! Ah! There they go!

209
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,041
Okay!

210
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,708
Here they go! Here they go! Here they go!

211
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,708
Look! Bang!

212
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,458
[all cheering]

213
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,375
[Yusuke] Fireworks are the best!

214
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,583
[all cheering]

215
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,458
Otaru is the best!

216
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,666
[all cheering]

217
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,500
Yukata Saeko is the best! That's right!

218
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,750
[all cheering]

219
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,541
Saeko!

220
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,083
[man 5] Oh, look, there's more!
Fireworks are the best!

221
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,750
[all cheering]

222
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,625
[man 5] Otaru is the best!

223
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,375
[all cheering]

224
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,166
[man 5] Fireworks are the best!

225
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
[all cheering]

226
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,833
[crowd exclaiming]

227
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,166
[crowd exclaiming]

228
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,625
[music fades]

229
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,666
It was so cool. Oh, no, no, Yuma! Hey!

230
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,541
Yuma, get back here!

231
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,958
[Kazu] And he's gone.

232
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,583
So, I've, uh, been thinking a bit.

233
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:12,958
[Kazu] Hmm?

234
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,041
Mm, I don't like to think about it…

235
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,583
Hmm… [laughs]

236
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,750
…but I thought
if our situations were reversed…

237
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,708
-If what?
-Um…

238
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,041
Ugh, how should I put this?

239
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,833
Um… Well, let's say, for instance,

240
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,000
if the donor of your new heart was

241
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,666
in love in their life,
if they were married,

242
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,625
or if they had a partner…

243
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:42,958
Mm-hmm.

244
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:47,541
…then they died,
leaving that loved one behind…

245
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,666
If that person…

246
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,833
If their heart is still beating,
alive inside someone else,

247
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:58,083
do you think all of their memories
would still exist of their love in life?

248
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,500
-Mm.
-Mm.

249
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,416
If they do,

250
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,416
do you think the bereaved…
would wanna meet that heart?

251
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,875
If I were her…

252
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,041
I think I'd want to.

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,333
Something to think about.

254
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,458
[ship horn blaring in distance]

255
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,708
-Midori.
-[Midori crying]

256
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,833
Hey.

257
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,666
Are you… Oh.

258
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,708
[inhales sharply]

259
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,875
Oh… I'm sorry. [sniffles]

260
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,916
You wanna talk about work
and forget you saw this?

261
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,500
Or do you… [sniffles]

262
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,208
…wanna know why
I'm sitting in here crying?

263
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,041
Uh, well…

264
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,250
Tell me?

265
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,041
Thank you. [sobs]

266
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,541
Let's talk while we eat.

267
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,375
Yeah, just sit down.

268
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,333
I'm gonna eat.

269
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,333
[Saeko] Mm.

270
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,541
Ooh, I got eel!

271
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,708
[Midori sobbing]

272
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,500
[Midori sniffles]

273
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,250
[whimsical music playing]

274
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,458
Long story short,

275
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,708
it's always been

276
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,416
my fate to have success in career,

277
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,250
but not when it comes to love. [sniffles]

278
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,583
Seriously. I'm so unlucky
that all I can think is it must be fate.

279
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,458
Something always ends up going wrong
whenever I fall in love.

280
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,000
There's no hope for me.

281
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,125
[sniffles]

282
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,958
Mm! I know it's fate.

283
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:13,958
It's my fate.

284
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,333
From the way I'm learning to see things,

285
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,291
sometimes the word fate is used

286
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,250
when someone thinks
that something's been decided already.

287
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,291
I don't really believe that.

288
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,291
I mean, don't you feel like
fate's actually up to us?

289
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,083
[Midori] Hmm?

290
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,000
[Saeko] Yeah, like,
while we're here, alive,

291
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,875
we're constantly making choices
all day long.

292
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,000
It's just one decision after another.

293
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,625
And what determines our futures
is… is connected to those decisions.

294
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,416
I feel like you make your own path
in the world.

295
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,083
You harness it yourself.

296
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,625
I get that.

297
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,375
So I feel like good choices
bring good things to us,

298
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,666
and bad choices bring bad things.

299
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,500
And it's no one else's fault.

300
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,791
That's how we should
think about the world.

301
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,375
That should go for both
our work lives and love lives.

302
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,291
It's not fate or anything like that.

303
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,208
-[Midori] Mm.
-Midori.

304
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,916
Let's consider the choices we make

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,458
and stop thinking our lives
have been decided.

306
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:13,333
If we keep trying, none of us know where
life's adventures will take us, do we?

307
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,083
[Midori] Mm-hmm.

308
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,458
[laughs]

309
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,000
Mm. That's true.

310
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,958
[Midori chuckles]

311
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,208
What's going on with you?

312
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,625
So all you needed was to cry and then put
food in your mouth, and you're better now?

313
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,708
Ah, I'm sorry. But thanks.

314
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,625
[both laugh]

315
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,875
[Saeko laughs] It's okay.

316
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,083
What am I doing lecturing you on fate?

317
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,291
[Midori] Mm.

318
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,583
Huh? Didn't you wanna talk about work?

319
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,625
Okay. So I've got two projects
that I need help with.

320
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,958
I'll let you choose. Or should I choose?

321
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,250
Do you wanna pick which one?

322
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,250
Since you just explained to me
your thoughts on fate, you wanna choose?

323
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,333
Mm… Mm-hmm. Yeah.

324
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,041
Do you wanna make a presentation
opposite a competitor?

325
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,125
Challenging, exciting…

326
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,666
Or something smaller and easier,

327
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,833
but it doesn't pay as well
as the first one does.

328
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,916
Although it does seem like
a good investment for the future.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What'll it be?

330
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,750
Hmm…

331
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,333
Mm…

332
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,458
[muffled] Uh, well…

333
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,166
[whimsical music playing]

334
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,541
[student] Good morning.

335
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,833
Hey, buddy.

336
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,291
What are you looking at?

337
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,875
I heard today's gonna be….

338
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,000
One, two, three, four,

339
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,583
five, and six, seven, eight.

340
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,625
One, two, three, four, five…

341
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,333
[indistinct shouting]

342
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,708
A lot of our students
are into good coffee.

343
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,916
We've had several requests
to have it here.

344
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,125
Oh, I see.

345
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,541
Is this it here?

346
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,875
Yep, we've just been using it for storage.

347
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,875
[Saeko] Really?

348
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,125
[gasps] What have you got here?
It's gorgeous!

349
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,000
I know, right? It's fantastic!

350
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,750
-[Saeko gasps]
-Huh?

351
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,041
Huh? What are you doing here?

352
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,083
I, uh…

353
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,041
I think I should be asking you
the same question.

354
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,250
Huh? I'm here for work.

355
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,458
Ah! For the coffee thing we're doing?

356
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,333
I'm Saeko Sugawara. I work for Akane.

357
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,333
Oh…

358
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,250
Kazumasa Naruse from Student Affairs.

359
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,541
[woman] Looks like you know each other.

360
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
[Saeko chuckles]

361
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,041
So what happened?

362
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,250
-Huh? What do you mean?
-With this!

363
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,583
Oh! I think it was just left here
from before. They said to throw it out.

364
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,791
Really?

365
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,625
It's a coffee roaster of some sort?

366
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,833
Yeah, that's right.

367
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,916
Wow, that's cool.

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,958
Oh, it's great!
And it's quite old from the looks of it.

369
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,916
I think I saw a picture of one of these
same machines while doing research.

370
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,750
Ah, is that right?

371
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,958
I don't think you get it.

372
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,333
It's like finding something
off the Titanic.

373
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,166
[chuckles] What?

374
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,958
It's really that old, huh?

375
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,375
So I went a little overboard,
but it's really great.

376
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,833
Oh, I see. All right.

377
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,375
I'm sorry. Um…

378
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,083
-You mind if I send the office a photo?
-Yeah, that's fine.

379
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,500
Go ahead.

380
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,541
-All right. Well, I gotta get back.
-Okay.

381
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,708
-I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you so much.

382
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,541
It's great.

383
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,875
[phone camera clicks]

384
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,625
[Saeko] Ah…

385
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,208
-[phone camera clicks]
-Wow.

386
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,666
[Saeko sighs]

387
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,333
Wait.

388
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,416
Did you say you were getting rid of it?

389
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,458
Yeah. They said to throw it out
so we can store more potatoes.

390
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,250
No, no, no, no!
That cannot happen. You can't do that.

391
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,125
Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,166
Oh, I'm sorry.

393
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,583
[Saeko sighs]

394
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,041
It's weird, huh?

395
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,416
What's going on here?

396
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,125
Huh?

397
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,166
Oh, forget it.

398
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,416
[phone buzzing]

399
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,083
Ah, excuse me a sec.

400
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,958
Hello.

401
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,833
Yes, that's right.

402
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,041
Yeah, I know! It's an amazing discovery.

403
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,791
Yeah. Right.

404
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,208
[excited] Seriously?

405
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,958
Yes.

406
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,875
Ah! Okay, I understand.

407
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,625
Yeah, I'll check back in later.

408
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,500
All right, I'll let 'em know.

409
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,750
Thank you.

410
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,041
So here's the thing.

411
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,875
Apparently, what you have here
is an old PROBAT machine.

412
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,166
There are only a few people in Japan
who know how to repair them.

413
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,166
And one of these guys
is a craftsman where I work

414
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,750
and is an expert on these old things.

415
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,166
Oh yeah?

416
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,083
The man's on his way over now.

417
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,833
He said that he got emotional seeing it.

418
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,375
[both laugh]

419
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,875
So this thing… Ah!

420
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,041
So it's… it's really great, isn't it?

421
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:22,958
Mm-hmm.

422
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,208
It's fate, I guess you could say.

423
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,250
Yeah.

424
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,750
Right?

425
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,333
Huh?

426
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,333
-Ah…
-Oh.

427
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,041
Or…

428
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,875
Or a… a coincidence. A random event.

429
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,958
I think sometimes we use the word fate
when, actually, it's just a coincidence.

430
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,083
Uh-huh.

431
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,541
Yeah, I guess you're right. Coincidence.

432
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,875
[chuckles]

433
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:54,791
Yeah.

434
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,125
[feel-good music playing]

435
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,958
-[Kazu] Miss Sugawara.
-Hmm? Oh.

436
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,041
I, uh… I wasn't sure if I should
offer our coffee to such an expert.

437
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,333
However, you might wanna see
what we've been working with

438
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,583
as a starting point.

439
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,750
-Here you go.
-Ah, well, thank you so much.

440
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,791
-Looks great.
-Enjoy.

441
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,458
-Here we go.
-Okay.

442
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,416
Hmm…

443
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,916
This kind of coffee
makes you wanna be quiet.

444
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, it does?

445
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,166
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

446
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,416
No, it's okay. It does have potential.

447
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,750
This is a really great space.

448
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,583
I like it.

449
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,708
It's nice.

450
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,208
Mm.

451
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,166
Well, thanks. Glad you like it.

452
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,875
In this kind of setting,

453
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:12,208
the coffee should make people wanna
talk and connect with each other.

454
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,166
[Kazu] Mm.

455
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:21,250
Mm. So I think
we should go for something a bit lighter.

456
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,083
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,166
I never used to like drinking it,
so I'm new to it.

458
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,083
I've just now gotten interested.

459
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,125
Mm. Is that right?

460
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,041
Yeah.

461
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,833
I had a pretty large operation.

462
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:42,083
And after that,
I had lots of changes going on.

463
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,833
I started to like coffee, for example.

464
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,708
[Saeko] Mm.

465
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,041
I've never heard of that before.

466
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,083
[Kazu] Mm.

467
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,375
[gentle piano music playing]

468
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,083
Welcome to my obsession.

469
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,375
[both laugh]

470
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:58,916
Ah, thank you.

471
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,208
My personality changed too, a little.

472
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,208
[Saeko] Mm.

473
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,333
So…

474
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,375
Yeah.

475
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,000
[chuckles] What is it? Tell me what?

476
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:19,208
I wondered how I reminded you of

477
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,708
the person you were in love with.

478
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,958
-Oh.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

479
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,083
No, that's okay.

480
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,041
Uh…

481
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,291
What was he like? Was he fun to be around?

482
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,416
[chuckles]

483
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,875
Yeah. So much fun.

484
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,625
-[laughs]
-Really?

485
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:38,125
So maybe I reminded you of him
'cause I changed.

486
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,916
Originally, I was kinda boring.

487
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,916
I wasn't really
the life-of-the-party kind of guy.

488
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:44,666
[Saeko] Mm.

489
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,708
Was he a big coffee fan?

490
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,041
Oh yeah.
I mean, so much so, he even had a café.

491
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,875
Really? Wow.

492
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,125
But I brewed coffee
better than he did. [laughs]

493
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,041
Is that right?

494
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,833
I really did love him, you know?

495
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,000
He died though.

496
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:04,916
What?

497
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,250
[music fades]

498
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,833
-Ah.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

499
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, no. I'm sorry. We're working.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

500
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,333
No, no. I shouldn't have asked you.

501
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,625
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

502
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,625
So…

503
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,666
I wanna do this right.

504
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:30,708
To do a good job.

505
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:34,750
Of course.

506
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,541
Looking forward to it.

507
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,833
-[Shinoda] Hey. Where is it?
-Ah!

508
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,583
-Show me!
-Shinoda. Over here.

509
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,666
-Where is it?
-[Kazu] What?

510
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,083
-This way?
-Uh…

511
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,791
Uh… [splutters]

512
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,083
Ooh…

513
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,125
Ah…

514
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,500
Yeah.

515
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,291
Ah…

516
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
[laughing]

517
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,791
You can find one if you really want to.

518
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,333
This is fate, right?

519
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,416
[feel-good music playing]

520
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,333
Was it you?

521
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,458
[Kazu] Huh?

522
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,500
This.

523
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,875
[Kazu] Oh! Yes.

524
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,083
Ah…

525
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:26,875
Thank you.

526
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,666
Oh, no. That's all right.

527
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,500
[Shinoda] I can't thank you enough.

528
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,208
Now let's get started.

529
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,208
Don't worry. I'll get you running.

530
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,458
[wind whistling]

531
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,000
[woman] Looks like it's going to be
a pretty big one.

532
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,958
Do you think the trains will be okay?

533
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,791
[man] I think it'd be better
if we went home early.

534
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:00,375
[reporter] It is currently moving
northeast over the Sea of Japan

535
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,125
at 20 kilometers per hour

536
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,125
and is expected to make landfall
in Hokkaido soon.

537
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:09,500
With the typhoon bearing down,
Hokkaido is now in the storm zone.

538
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:17,791
Hey, where's Shinoda?

539
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,208
Oh. He just left for the university.

540
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,375
[woman] Said he was worried about
the coffee roaster.

541
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,416
Huh?

542
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,166
Is he gonna be okay?

543
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,000
-[man 1] I got this one!
-[man 2] Okay, okay!

544
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:32,875
[man 1] There.

545
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,458
-We need to take this off!
-Yeah! Wait, wait, wait!

546
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,916
-It should be easy!
-[man 2] Wait a sec!

547
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,041
[man 1]You got it?

548
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,333
-[man 2] I got it!
-Okay! Good!

549
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,875
[man 1] All right, now the other one!

550
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,250
-Okay!
-[man 2] All right!

551
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,500
That's it!

552
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,708
[man 1] Hand it to me!

553
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,375
[phone line ringing]

554
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,291
[Kazu] Hello.

555
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,208
Oh my God, sweetie, hi.
You okay over there?

556
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,041
-Mm. How are things where you are?
-[student 1] Here they are, Kazumasa.

557
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,458
-Ah, in the back.
-We're bringing the apples in right now.

558
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,041
I think we got here just in time.

559
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:01,958
That's good.

560
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,250
They've stopped all the trains.

561
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,166
We opened the lounge
to students who are stuck.

562
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,833
I think I'm staying
till we're all able to go home.

563
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,333
[student 2] Pass out the extras!

564
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:14,500
-Mm. Be careful, all right?
-[student 2] Thank you!

565
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,333
And take care of your mom and dad.

566
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,208
-[knocking at door]
-[guard] Come in.

567
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:25,916
Hello.

568
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:28,041
-[guard] Hi.
-How's it going?

569
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,708
Good. Nothing too major.

570
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,791
Okay, that's good.

571
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,041
I hope it calms down soon.

572
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,375
Well, looks like
the storm will last quite a while.

573
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,583
Tonight's gonna be a long one.

574
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,625
Yeah, I guess so.

575
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,166
The rain really is coming down.

576
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:48,875
[guard] Mm.

577
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:52,916
[Kazu] Hmm?

578
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,125
[uplifting music playing]

579
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,666
Oh!

580
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,791
I'll bring it back!

581
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,791
[thunder rumbling]

582
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,208
[Kazu] What are you…
What are you doing out here in all this?

583
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:22,875
[Saeko] What? Ah! The wind was so strong
when I got out of the taxi!

584
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,333
I couldn't move.

585
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,666
But I'm fine. Really.
I don't want you to worry about it!

586
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,500
-No! You're not fine at all!
-Huh?

587
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,750
It's only gonna get worse.
Here! Put this on!

588
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:32,916
I'll take that.

589
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,916
Thank you for coming.

590
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,500
Mr. Shinoda… Is he all right?

591
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:37,916
He's okay. He's here.

592
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,500
Oh really? Thank goodness.

593
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:42,958
Are you okay?

594
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:44,583
Yes.

595
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,916
-Let's go.
-Uh…

Oh. You came.

607
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,458
Yes. I was worried about you.

608
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,291
Thought you'd get blown away.

609
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,750
[chuckles] No way. Not me.

610

[Saeko chuckles]

611
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,833
Looks like we'll be up all night.

612
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,083
Yeah.

613
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,208
It's a little exciting, huh?

614
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,250
Uh, staying at the college all night.

615
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,708
Anything could happen.

-We ready?
-[Saeko] Yes, coming right up.

[crowd cheering]

622
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,375
You think we should get some coffee going?
Don't you think that'd be nice?

623
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,333
-[man] Good work today.
-Thank you.

624
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,125

with butter just for you.

00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,375
Excuse me. Is there any water left?

652
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,500
Water? I'll get some for you.
It's downstairs.

653
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,708
[both] Thank you.

Oh, I just love libraries.

Whoa. I don't know this one.

What? No…

661
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,750
Why are you just watching me sleep?

662
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,000
[Saeko] Yusuke, come on, stop it.

663
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,208
I told you not to watch me sleep.

Sorry.

It's okay.

Yes?

There was…

673
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,583
There's something
that just now occurred to me.

674
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,166
Okay.

675

Do you mind if I tell you?

00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:58,875
Go ahead.

677
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,083

happy birthday.

681
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,208
Today…

682
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:41,208
we should… be celebrating…

683
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,500
celebrating around the world…

Saeko's here in it.

Happy birthday, Saeko.

What is this?

694
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,541
Why are you… doing this?
