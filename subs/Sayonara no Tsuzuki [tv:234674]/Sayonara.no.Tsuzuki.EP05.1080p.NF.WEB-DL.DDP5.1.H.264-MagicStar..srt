00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,000
Why are you just watching me sleep?

5
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,958
Good morning.

6
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,875
Don't "good morning" me.

00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,166
Huh?

00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,875
What?

00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,791
Were you out?

10
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,125
Mm. I was out connecting with nature.

-[Saeko] Hmm?
-[chuckles] You know what?

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,416
You're really adorable

When you love a person's sleeping face,
they say that's the sign of true love.

No! It's the truth!

[laughs] It is!

18
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,583
And when you're asleep, you're so cute.

19
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,458
It's like, I don't know, you look
even prettier when you're resting.

All right. Try this.

33
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,625
Listen to the sound of my heart right now.

34
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,291
Just feel this heartbeat.

35
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,000
Such a peaceful rhythm.

[Shinoda] Well, nothing now.

Um, wasn't your phone ringing?

[Saeko] Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

Well, it's okay. It's just…

At that point, my heart

Is it really true though?

We don't have evidence

112
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,083
since they'll never give us
the information

about who the donor was
or who received the transplant.

Is this just a coincidence,
and we're pretending like it's something?

We never should have met, should we?

Well, I'm glad either way…

138
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,375
that I got to see you.

139
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,666
Uh, that's very kind of you.

140
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,041
Still, it's weird.

I can't wrap my head around
what's happening.

Wow.

170
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,708
[laughs] I know, right?

171
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,916
[chuckles] Yeah.

172
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,791
Can I… say something?

173
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,458
It's just you never hesitate
to be the center of attention.

174
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,875
You and Shinoda are so passionate.

175
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,333
Are you all like that?

176
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,625
[chuckles] Where I work?

177
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,583
[both laughing]

178
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,916
You might be right.

179
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,000
We're not needlessly humble,
that's for sure.

"Amazing work." "Yes, I did my best."
"Everyone's doing great."

181
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,375
-Yeah. We're all like that.
-Mm.

182
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,208
That's why I like working there, I guess.

183
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,541
I see.

184
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,291
[music fades]

185
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, I guess you want to know
what I've been going through.

186
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:04,625
I mean, how it feels to have
Yusuke's heart beating inside of me.

187
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,875
-[Saeko] If it's all right.
-Yeah, it's fine.

188
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,041
I'm not sure
if I can explain it very well, but…

189
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,833
I believe it has his memories.

190
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,541
It's the only explanation I can think of.

191
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,083
Memories?

192
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,708
Yes.

193
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,333
His heart

194
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:34,125
carries his memories…
like a brain, almost.

195
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,958
I still live my own life
as Naruse every day.

196
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,708
But… occasionally,
Yusuke's memories come alive.

197
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,708
And the memories don't feel like
they belong to me either.

198
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,833
No. Yusuke is here inside
but as a separate part of my body.

199
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,666
Like, I play piano now,
even though I've never played before.

200
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,875
What?

201
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,625
It goes like…

00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,916
The island of Hawaii…

205

00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,791
recently?

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,958
Did you play it at the airport?

Yes.

So you were

there?

Yes.

I found the person who owned this heart.

Who they were.

I don't wanna know though.

in their life… their memories,

-[student 6] Hi, Naruse.
-Hi there.

332
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,833
Huh? Hey there.

333
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,875
This is amazing, isn't it?
It's a huge hit.

334
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,208
Naturally.

335
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,958
Oh, of course.

336
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,166
[quietly] We are all like that.

337
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,083
Huh?

338
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,875
Ah… Right. Oh, nothing.

339
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,125
[ethereal music playing]

340
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,333
Isn't this whole situation crazy?

341
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,250
It's all for real.

342
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:19,708
Yusuke's heart continues to live on
in Naruse's body, along with his memories.

343
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,208
That's incredible, don't you think?

344
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,208
[sighs]

345
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,291
So, what's he like?

346
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:31,166
He's nice.
He's a really good guy. Very kind.

347
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,708
You'll meet him and see.

348
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,041
Oh. Is that right?

349
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,583
[Saeko] Hmm?

350
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,625
His heart, huh?

351
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,250
What is it?

352
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,833
Well, I… I don't wanna meet this guy.

353
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,250
Why not?

354
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,250
You should probably stop seeing him too.

355
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,875
You may be right.

356
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:59,416
Yusuke's heart
could carry his memories somehow.

357
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,833
Still, he's not the same guy.

358
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,708
He isn't Yusuke.

359
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,416
It's not like Yusuke's really there.

360
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,416
I know that.

361
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,375
[sighs]

362
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,500
Why would you say that?

363
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:20,250
It's not just 'cause Yusuke's
somewhere inside.

364
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,708
You're falling for this guy, aren't you?

365
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,583
[laughs]

366
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,708
What are you talking about, Kengo?

367
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,083
Well, are you?

368
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,041
I swear it isn't like that.

369
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:37,833
I personally think you should stop this.
Right now.

370
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:42,541
I can't.

371
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,750
Because Yusuke's in there.

372
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,250
I can listen and hear his heart beating.
It knows I'm there too. I swear.

373
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,250
So Yusuke hasn't totally left this world.

374
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,166
I have to keep going. I won't stop.

375
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,708
[groans]

376
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,708
Well, do whatever you want,

377
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,458
but I'll pass.

378
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,958
How can you pass on this?

379
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,291
[wistful music playing]

380
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,458
Good night.

[Kengo] I'm sorry.

[music fades]

389
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,541
Welcome.

390
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,708
[Kazu] Oh.

391
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,291
[gasps]

392
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:45,625
What?

393
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,916
Uh, sorry about that.

394
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,916
Hold on. Are you

395
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,291
Naruse?

396
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,625
What?

397
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,416
Oh. Thank you so much.

398
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,958
So you heard about me
from Sugawara, right?

399
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,916
Yes.

400
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,916
Ah.

401
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,708
When I searched for Nakamachi,
this café popped up.

402
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,666
Ah… I understand.

403
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,708
I found my way here…

404
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,333
as if I'd been to your café before.

405
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:38,958
Oh, really?

406
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,375
This is a really nice café you've got.

407
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,666
It was Yusuke.

408
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,958
Excuse me?

409
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,208
It was Yusuke who took care of the plant.

410
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,791
I told him there's no way a coffee tree
would grow in Hokkaido.

411
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:17,041
Still, he was confident
it would thrive here.

412
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,083
Oh, really?

413
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,166
When you came in and you saw me,

414
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,291
it looked like you recognized me.

415
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,125
Oh.

416
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,750
I did. I'm sorry.

417
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,458
So you really… You really remember me?

418
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,291
Yes.

what would Yusuke do…

to help you feel better?

Please tell me.

No, I'm all right.

438
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,333
[Kazu] I'd really like to know.

439
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,541
Hey.

440
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,166
[Saeko] He would start dancing.

441
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,375
What?

442
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,833
But he was good. Breakdancing, especially.

443
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,541
You're lying. [laughs]

444

No, I'm not.

445
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,625
He'd dance like crazy.

446
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:41,416
Spinning on his head,
jumping high, flipping around.

447
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,833
Well, um…

448
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,166
-Really?
-Dance for me.

449
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,625
Well, I wonder…

450
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,791
if his heart remembers how.

451
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,750
It could.

452
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,625
Like… like this?

453
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,416
[grunting]

454
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,458
[Saeko] I lied.

455
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,166
[Kazu] Huh?

456
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,208
I apologize, but I lied.

Are you serious? That's not fair.

I was attempting to do it.

462
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,541
I thought I would start breakdancing
if I tried.

Come on. That was really mean.

00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,083
That could've been a disaster.
What if I fell?

before you started.

he'd do anything for you.

That's how he was.

until the next train arrives…

475

where my own feelings lie.

00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,291
I love my wife more than anything.

And that's never going to change.

However…

482
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,041
I can't help
but keep thinking about Saeko.

483
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:36,416
I truly want her to find
peace in this world.

484
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,083
And I wanna make her happy.

485
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,125
It's overwhelming.

[breathes shakily]

How can I trust these myself?

00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:57,625
Do these feelings belong to me,
or do they belong to Yusuke?

489
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,541
I wanna see her.

490
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,625
I believe these feelings are mine,
but I don't know.

491
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,750
Why can't I figure this out?

I just don't know.

Why can't I decide?

497
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,000
I can't go on like this.
