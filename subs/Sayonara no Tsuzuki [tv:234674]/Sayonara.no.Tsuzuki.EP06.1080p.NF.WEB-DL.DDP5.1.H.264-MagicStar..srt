166
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,958
It feels great out here.

167
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,625
I think I can do this. Hup.

168
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,833
Aw, but this one's kind of…

169
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,791
[Saeko] Looks tough, huh?

170
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,250
[Kazu] Yeah, this part's hard.
They're too far apart.

171
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,250
I think if I could…

172
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,125
[grunts]

173
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,250

00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,375

-Yes!

175

[both laugh]

176
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,333

[Saeko giggles]

178
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,375
What is she gonna play?

179
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,583
Ah!

180
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,541
Oh yeah!

181
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,750
-Okay.
-Yeah, here we go. I'm not sure… Oh!

182
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,666
[both laugh]

183
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,166
[waitress] Thanks for waiting.
Here's your extra-large portion.

184
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,041
-Good luck.
-[Kazu] Thank you very…

185
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,125
Whoa! [chuckles]

186
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,333
That's a lot!

187
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,208
So I guess that's it.
He always ordered the biggest portion.

188
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,458
Do you think you can eat all that?

189
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,833
Of course.

190
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,625
[both in Japanese] Let's eat.

191
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,458
[in English] Mmm. It's so good.

192
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,666
-Mmm. Yeah, it really is!
-[laughs] Mm.

193
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,875
[employee] Of course.
Thank you for coming.

194
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,000
Have a good one.

195
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,166
[Saeko] Mmm!

196
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,750
[music ends]

197
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,958
That was delicious. [clears throat]

198
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,958
[Kazu] That was so good.

199

[laughs]

200
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:21,458
Oh, and then two jumbo okonomiyaki mixed.

201
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:22,958
What? No!

202
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,041
Which he

203
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,541
never actually ate.

204
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,458
[laughs]

205
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,958
I had you going, didn't I?

206
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,166
I like teasing you. It's fun.

207
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,791
Yeah, yeah.

THE CAFÉ IN THE NEXT TOWN OVER

215
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,208
[Kengo] The café you're heading to now

216
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,458
is run by Yusuke's mother.

217
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,208
She moved a long time ago
when he was still really little.

218
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,833
But she lived in the next town over,

219
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,500
so I'd go there with Yusuke a lot.

220
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,875
He'd say that's where my mom is.

221
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,375
But he never went inside.

222
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,916
I gotta think that
he really wanted to see her.

223
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:15,916
Let's go in…

224
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,666
and see what it's like.

225
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,625
[woman] Hello. Come in.

226
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,291
Are you open?

227
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,166
Yes, have a seat.

228
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,958
[Saeko] Coffee okay?

229
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,083
Oh.

230
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,083
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

231
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,875
Excuse me.
Uh, can we get two coffees, please?

232
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,000
Coming right up.

[Kazu] Ah…

00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,500
I feel like I kind of understand…

245
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,291
why he liked it here.

246
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,458
Yeah.

247
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,958
Thank you.

Thank you for today.

I have had… a wonderful time.

250
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,291
My pleasure. Thank you for inviting me.

251
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,541
I realized that

252
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,958
there's a lot I didn't know about Yusuke.

[sentimental music playing]

254
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,583
I've always wondered why

255
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,791
he would try hard
to entertain people so often.

256
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,958
He always noticed
if someone was struggling.

257
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,208
He said his role was
to act as a softener in the world.

258
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,375
He must've been
such a sad and lonely kid himself

259
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,750
that he didn't want others
to experience that.

260
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,416
He hated how much sadness
was in the world.

[breathes deeply]

262
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,291
That's why he was like that.

263
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,125
Yeah, I see that.

264
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,000
-It's a little embarrassing.
-[both laugh]

Praising him this much to you.

266
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,458
He could also go overboard sometimes.

267
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,125
-Mm…
-Sometimes it was like, "Get a grip."

268
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,500
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,000
[Saeko] Hmm?

270
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:21,416
I guess… [sniffles]
…it's a weird moment to say sorry.

Hey, you know what?

We should take a picture.

274
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,833
And show Kengo.

275
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,250
Uh…

00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,833
-So…
-I can take it if you want.

Hmm? You wanna go this way a little?

-This way?
-Yeah.

No, uh, uh, go a little more…

Mm, is this good?

Uh, no. I think the other way was better.

Huh?

306
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,500
May I ask who you are?

307
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,791
Your name is Saeko. You were engaged to

308
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,791
Yusuke Nakamachi, weren't you?

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,916
Who are you?

310
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,166
My name is Miki Naruse.

311
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,541
[Saeko] What?

312
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,958
And Kazumasa's my husband.

313
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:46,958
Oh.

314
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,291
I'm sorry… for surprising you like this.

315
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,375
It's okay. But…

316
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,541
I do want to thank you.

317
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,375
Thanks to Yusuke Nakamachi,

318
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,791
thanks to him offering his heart to us,

319
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,083
my husband can go on living.

320
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,166
I'm really… very grateful for that.

321

You don't need to…

322
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,916
It's not me who you should be thanking.

323
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,750
Can you please stop doing this?

324
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,083
Sorry?

325
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,041
I know how you must be feeling.

326
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:28,416
I know it's true your boyfriend's heart
is now beating inside Kazumasa.

327
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,958
However, he's still the guy he is.

328
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,583
He isn't your boyfriend.

329
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,708
So stop it, trying to get closer
to my husband like this.

330
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,833
Get closer?

331
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,833
-What are you saying? You think that--
-But that's what's going on.

332
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,458
Look at his point of view.

333
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,833
He can't just brush you to the side
'cause he still owes you.

334
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,666
And now…

335
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:55,833
he's finally…

336
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,041
he's finally healthy, and…

337
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,333
and he can enjoy his life,

338
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:04,166
spend time with his family
like a normal person.

339
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,791
Please don't destroy that.

340
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,708
Listen, I know that your boyfriend's heart
is keeping him alive,

341
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:12,041
but he's still Kazu, and that's it.

342
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,500
Kazumasa is not Yusuke.

343
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:14,916
Hold on a minute, okay?

344
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:17,708
Did he

345
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:22,416
mention anything, any of this to you?

346
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,625
That he feels sorry for me,
that's why we talk?

347
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,583
Did he tell you that?

348
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,791
No, he didn't.

349
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,625
[Saeko breathes deeply]

350
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,166
The two of us don't have
a relationship like that.

351
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,958
It's not romantic between us.
I think he would agree with me too.

352
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:56,583
Maybe you should actually
talk to him about all this.

353
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
You think…

354
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,291
you got some idea about
what I've experienced.

355
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,625
How could you ever understand?

356
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,041
Don't be so hasty
in assuming you know how I feel.

357
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,583
Isn't Kazumasa still alive?
The one person you love most.

358
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,208
He is, right?

359
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,333
The love of your life.

360
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,416
Please don't act like this.
You know how I'm feeling.

-I wanna see him.
-[poignant music playing]

365
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,416
It is, after all, Yusuke's heart in there.

366
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,166
It holds memories of us inside it.

367
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,250
Now here you are insisting that…

368
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,500
that I can't see him?

369
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,166
How would that make you feel?

370
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,208
There's an accident. Kazumasa dies.

371
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:09,083
His heart's still alive, though,
inside someone else.

372
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,041
Is he actually dead?

373
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,583
And this has nothing to do with you?

374
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:18,916
And what if that heart
still knew who you were?

375
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,541
What if it still had memories
of you and him?

376
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,750
What would you do?

377
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,416
Would it still have nothing
to do with you?

378
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,958
Is that all you feel for him?

00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,041
Uh-huh.

498
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,291
But

499
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,083
this thing's not gonna be easy.

500
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,083
Getting a heart transplant

501
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:34,541
means that you live, but in a way,
the donor, he also gets to keep on living,

502
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:35,500
you know?

503
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,375
[Kazu] I'll be living a new life.

504
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:44,291
A new life together with the donor.

505
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,375
[uplifting music playing]

506
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,583
[Saeko] This is indeed the first time
we've shared an umbrella.

507
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,416
Yeah, that's right. Hmm.

508
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,541
I'm actually glad it's raining.

509
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,791
-[chuckles]
-[sniffles]

510
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:36,000
You can look at something you think's bad,

511
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,166
but if you let go,
it can actually turn out great.

512
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,666
Oh my goodness.
You really are one of a kind, Yusuke.

513
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,416
All I do is get super angry all the time.

514
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,958
But I think we'd have a lot of fun
if we spent our lives together.

515
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,250
Huh?

516
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,333
You proposing to me right now?

517
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,416
-No!
-Oh yes, you are!

518
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,291
-Not what I'm saying.
-All right, all right.

519
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,083
So… so right now,
if… if I proposed to you,

520
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,125
what would you say?

521
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,250
-I'd say no.
-You serious?

522
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,250
-You'd really say no?
-[laughs]

523
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,541
[Yusuke] No way.

524
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,583
-[Saeko] Did I say that?
-Uh-huh.

525
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:23,125
[rhythmic pop music continues]

526
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,500
[music ends]
