Damn it!

00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,375
He isn't Yusuke.
You're falling for this guy, aren't you?

9
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,208
[sobs] Why couldn't it just be an affair?

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,791
[Kazu] When you were down,
what would Yusuke do?

11
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,708
What does everyone want me to do now?

[Kazu] How long do you think
I'll be able to go…

15
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,875
till my heart gives out?

16
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,833
From now on, think in terms of months

17
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,041
or in weeks.

18
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,500
Less than a year.

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,125
Consider that as you plan for the future.

I just…

23
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,791
I'm kinda panicking.

24
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,083
I'm sorry.

00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,416
So scary.

Why am I struggling with this?

How uncool.

Yo, Saeko!

61
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,541
[chuckles] Are you serious?

62
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,416
You're like a guardian angel or something!

63
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,375
Huh?

64
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh, you figured it out.

65
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,791
-Now you know.
-Listen to this.

66
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,791
-I have to tell you. What?
-This is embarrassing.

67
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,291
I guess you caught a glimpse
of these wings right here.

68
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,416
I've been hiding these things.
[laughs] You got me!

69
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,875
-Wait a minute.
-[Hiro clears throat]

-[Hiro grunts]
-You hearing me?

72
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,791
You there?

73
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,125
[chuckles, groans] My back.

74
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,958
I threw it out the other day.

75
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,291
Oh. Uh, are you all right?

76
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,291
[groans] I'm too old. I hate it.

77
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,333
[chuckles]

78
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,500
When you're old,
stuff like this is a real pain in the ass.

79
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,000
I got the blues when I thought about
the future of my farm.

80
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,750
So I wanted to see your face.

81
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,833
[laughs]

82
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:05,458
But now that I've seen it,
I am all better. Mm.

83
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,125
Actually, you're the angel.

[Hiro] Huh?

86
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,333
What's that?

87
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,500
Is something wrong?

88
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,250
What's going on?

89
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,250
Saeko? What's the matter?

DID YOU SEE THIS?

93
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,208
Now let's hear what happened

94
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,416
from the woman
who actually encountered the bear.

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,750
Thank you for speaking with us.
Are you all right?

96
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,375
-Yes. I'm okay.
-Great.

97
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,875
Tell us about the situation.

98
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,833
It was pretty dark out
when I actually saw it.

99
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,166
But I locked eyes with it,

100
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,166
and I immediately started panicking.

101
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,625
[reporter] You locked eyes with it?
How far away were you?

102
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,791
[Saeko] I think it was somewhere
over there,

103
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,583
so I'd say it was about three meters away?

104
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,666
[reporter gasps] Only three meters?
That sounds really close.

105
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,250
And it's incredible that you warded it off
with just your gaze.

106
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,791
-[Yuma] So cool.
-How did you do it?

107
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,291
The bear was scared of her!

108
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,333
-[Saeko] I don't know. I was terrified.
-Yuma! Come on! School!

109
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,083
I mean, my whole body froze in fear.

110
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,958
Naturally.

111
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,166
And just how big was this bear?

112
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,708
-[Saeko] Well, it was like…
-Uh…

113
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,166
Okay, let's go.

114
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,291
-You're going to be late!
-[Yuma] What?

115
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,000
-[woman] Hey, hey, Midori!
-What is it?

116
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,500
-[woman] Quick, quick, quick.
-[man] Come here. Look at the TV.

117
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,333
[reporter] Is this a safe neighborhood?

118
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,375
-[Saeko] Uh, I couldn't say.
-[gasps] Saeko?

119
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,458
[man] Yeah.

120
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,458
[Saeko] I think this was the first time.
Certainly for me, it was.

121
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,375
But honestly, I'm not quite sure.

122
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,083
-[reporter] Okay.
-Saeko.

123
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,125
Why did you pick those track pants?

124
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,916
-Well, uh…
-[man] She seems…

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,208
-Is everything okay with her?
-Jogging?

126
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,291
[phone chimes]

127
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,208
SAEKO
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A BIT TODAY?

128
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,750
Was that all? I kinda need to…

129
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,583
How are you?

130
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,333
Oh.

131
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,083
Nice to see you.

132
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,250
Are you feeling all right?

133
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,416
Ah. Guess you heard about the bear.

134
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,708
Right. Well… yes.

135
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,625
About the bear.

136
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,250
I was really worried.

137
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,500
For the bear?

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,958
Yes.

139
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,083
Oh, no. [chuckles]

140
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
I meant to say I was worried for you.

141
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,375
[laughs]

142
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,291
You know,

143
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,166
I'm kind of relieved.

144
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,625
"Relieved"?

145
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,875
Well, you know, I figured

146
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,208
there's a pretty good chance
this would be awkward.

147
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,500
It was only yesterday
that we had that thing.

148
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,666
You must've thought about it as well?

149
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,041
How to act next time we saw each other?

150
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,375
You have this look when you're thinking.

151
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,708
[chuckles]

152
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,833
Anyways…

153
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,750
Yeah? [chuckles]

154
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,833
Well… [clears throat] …yes.

155
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,875
Well, I guess

156
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,500
I was too surprised to even be awkward.

157
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,625
[sighs]

158
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,958
Were you distracted
by the track pants I had on?

159
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,000
No. Uh, I wasn't paying attention to that.

160
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,875
I really thought right there,

161
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,083
in the middle of the street
with that bear,

162
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,583
that was gonna be my end.

163
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,041
Right.

164
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,291
And I didn't wanna die
in those awful pants

165
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,291
or go to a hospital in them. Nasty.

166
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,333
I've spent so much money
on being fashionable,

167
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,125
and this is my last outfit?

168
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,041
No! No way! I can't do it!

[sighs]

171
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,458
Actually, the two of us,

172
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,500
we have met before.

173
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,125
We just didn't realize it.

174
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,958
Yes.

175
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,458
That's true. We definitely have.

176
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,208
I was surprised seeing those rain boots.

177
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,416
What does it all mean?

178
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,541
Even if all this was fate,

179
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,208
it's tough to say how we'll end up
or where this fate is leading us.

180
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,416
That's true.

181
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,791
Everything all right?

182
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,833
Uh… yes.

183
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,791
I feel fine, actually.

184
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,916
That's good.

185
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,666
Yeah. [clears throat]

186
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,458
I have

187
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,125
made the decision to stop seeing you

188
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:01,833
going forward.

189
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,541
What?

190
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,041
Dealing with all this
is too much for me now.

191
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,875
I'm not gonna lie.

192
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,625
It's left me feeling really confused

193
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,916
about us.

194
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,875
'Cause I've never fallen in love
with anyone as much as I did with Yusuke.

195
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,833
I was so in love.

196
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,458
I'm still in love too. Even now.

197
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,041
I know.

198
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,458
It's true that he's dead.

199
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,250
However, he's still alive inside of you.

200
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,583
And he's not just alive.

201
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,416
It's his memories and his mind too.

202
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,916
Yusuke lives on inside you.

203
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,125
I just wanted to see him again.

204
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,458
I had to see him again.

205
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,500
Who wouldn't take that chance?

206
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,833
But…

207
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,541
now I'm really confused.

208
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,416
Do I wanna see Yusuke,
or do I really wanna see you?

209
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Is it Yusuke I love? Or do I love you?

210
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,208
We kissed, and I almost had sex with you,
but I couldn't.

211
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,125
I apologize.

212
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,375
But I just

213
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,583
feel like I can't take this.

214
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,291
Like I can't handle it anymore.

215
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,458
And it's driving me crazy.
And I wanna be fair to you.

216
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,833
If I keep seeing you,

217
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,875
I'll start wanting to spend
all my time with you.

218
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,916
And that's not fair to you, is it?

219
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,833
You have your own life
and your own family.

220
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,750
And I don't wanna screw that up for you.

221
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,458
However, I do wonder where your head's at.

222
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,166
I'm curious how you're feeling.

223
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,958
Is Yusuke's heart the reason why
you've been so nice to me?

224
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,500
Or do you yourself actually feel this way?

225
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,291
I don't know.

226
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,333
But when I consider that possibility,

227
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:19,208
I… feel like I'm going insane.

228
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,541
Then my head starts spinning.
It's overwhelming.

229
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,708
That bear made things even worse.

230
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,875
I was going…

231
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:42,041
to lie to you about how I felt
until I came here.

232
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,875
"I only love Yusuke."

233
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,166
"I don't have any feelings for you."

234
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,583
"We can't be together."

235
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,166
I was going to say that

236
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,416
and then never see you again.

237
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,583
But it just isn't true.

238
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,958
I wanted you to know
how I really felt inside.

239
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,250
[emotional piano music playing]

240
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,291
We had this strange connection.

241
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,000
It was quite fun,

242
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,958
and I'm grateful to you.

243
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:27,000
I'd never want…
to disrespect any of that with a lie.

[chuckles]

245
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,583
This is all your fault.

246
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,125
You're easy to talk to,
and you're kind of cute.

247
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,875
Anyway,

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,625
it's time for me to stop.

249
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,958
I know I'm not making sense right now.

250
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,416
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,500
No, I understand what you're saying.

252
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,458
That being said,

253
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,916
I'm grateful for our time together.

254
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,666

please take care of him?

-Hmm?

261
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,541
I was hoping to discuss something
with you. Do you have a minute?

262
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,458
What's up?

263
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,458
Ah…

264
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,875
You say you wanna discuss,

265
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,541
but the look on your face says
you've already decided.

266
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:45,750
What?

267

All right.

271
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,000
So what now?

272
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,291
Do you wanna treat me to lunch, hmm?

273
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,875
That sounds nice.

274
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,375
Well, then.

275
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,041

00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,875
She already decided
to end things with you.

335
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes.

336
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,250
Well, there's your answer.

337
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,833
You should leave her be.

338
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,000
For her sake, at least.

339
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,250
No, I need to know.

340
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,958
I think of what you said the other day.

341
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,125
You felt like you were

342
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,375
making things difficult for everyone.

343
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,125
You don't need to
think of yourself like that.

344
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,583
Let me rephrase.

345
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,250
You should stop thinking like that.

346
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,250
Just your being here,

347
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:05,541
it goes a long way to making folks happy.

348
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,666
Lots of people.

349
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:09,958
So,

350
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,125
just relax and live your life.

351
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,291
I really appreciate it.

352
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,666
But…

353
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,041
I can't afford to do that now.
