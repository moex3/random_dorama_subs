00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,166
[Kazu] Oh.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,625
I wonder if I'll ever be able
to have any alcohol one day.

167
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,333
Hmm?

168
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,583
[chuckles]

169
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,708
Like, what if I become,
like, an awful drunk?

170
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,583
Like always shouting, "I need a beer!"

171
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,750
You know, like some stereotypical bad boy.

172
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,291
[both laugh]

173
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,583
Your idea of what
a stereotypical bad boy is is interesting.

174
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,416
That's like what a kid might say.

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,875
-[Kazu] Really, you think so?
-Mm-hmm.

176
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,250
[Kazu] Maybe because
I've always wanted to be someone like that

177
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,250
since I was a kid.

178
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,166
[Saeko] Hmm?

179
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,500
[Kazu] Yeah, like a rebel, you know?

180
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,250
Maybe I haven't grown out of it.
[chuckles]

181
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,958
Oh, but really, mostly what I wanna be is…

182
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:35,208
a guy who does a lot of goofy things
and, mm, makes you wonder.

183
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,875
Someone who's fun.

184
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,750
Mm. Yeah, I see.

185
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,250
And I think it's because I'm so quiet

186
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,375
I always worry I'm being,
you know, a headache.

187
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,000
I worry people just by being alive.

188
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,208
Oh, I do think

189
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,958
it's a really good thing
I got Yusuke's heart.

190
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,166
'Cause I somehow became
a little more… more fun to hang out with.

191
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,750
His memories are all fun things.

192
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,541
Mm, it's great.

193
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,791
[chuckles]

194
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,500
But he's leaving,

195
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,500
and it's pretty sad.

196
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,583
I'll miss him.

197
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,083
Mm.

198
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,083
[emotional piano music playing]

199
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry.

200
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,416
I said I was here as Yusuke,

201
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,833
and I've just, um, been Kazumasa today.

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,708
But you can be you.

203
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,583
No "sorry" needed.

204
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,541
I'm enjoying you.

205
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,500
You really think this is interesting?

206
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,291
Mm-hmm. I'm enjoying it.

207
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,916
I think it's fun.

208
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:53,916
Okay.

209
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,375
Mm.

210
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,958
Well, I'm glad.

211
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,708
[Kazu] Oh no!

212
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,666
[Saeko] Ah!

[emotional piano music continues]

215
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,458
[Kazu] Thanks.

216
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,583
-[Saeko giggles]
-What a mess.

[both laugh]

218
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,500
Whoa.

219
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,208
So this is what… you wanna do?

220
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
I never got to live with Yusuke, so…

221
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,375
Mm.

222
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,333
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

223

Huh?

225
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,833
Can I…

226
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,291
Please?

227
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,750

[music fades]

230
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,875
This is Saeko.

231
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
Can I ask who's calling?

232
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,000
This is Miki Naruse.

233
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,458
Kazumasa's wife.

234
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,041
I'm sorry to just call you
out of the blue like this.

235
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:49,375
Kazumasa should be arriving there
anytime now.

236
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,041
What?

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,083
And this is what he's gonna say.

238
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,083
That he's in good health,
great physical condition.

239
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,125
And that means

240
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,583
that the memories of your fiancé
will disappear

241
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:10,833
for good.

242
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,666
And he's there for you to say goodbye.

243
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,875
That's why he flew there.

244
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,166
But… it's a lie.

245
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,208
The heart that he has…

246
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,625
is about to give out.

247
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,083
Kazumasa is dying.

248
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,333
He's getting weaker as we speak.

249
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,250
And still he… he just had to see you.

250
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,666
Even though he's about to die,
he said it was important.

251
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,458
He couldn't help himself.

252
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,500
He just wanted to see you

253
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,833
one last time before he dies.

254
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,541
That's what he said.

255
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,291
No, that's…

256
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,291
Why are you doing this?

257
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,500
'Cause I love Kazu.

258
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:25,458
The love I feel
is more than just an ordinary love.

259
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,166
So I've accepted it.

260
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,875
And if you're wondering

261
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,250
why I'm calling you right now…

262
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,375
it's because I want you to suffer too.

263
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,625
I want you to go along with this lie

264
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,625
that he has gambled his life on.

265
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,625
I want you to…

266
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,833
[melancholy piano music playing]

267
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,625
…to shoulder the burden
of that kind of pain too.

268
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,250
And I'm sure that
he's gonna act like he's recovered.

269
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,125
Don't believe what he's telling you.

270
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,166
He definitely has his limits.

271
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,208
There's a lot he can't do.

272
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,000
Too much exertion
could make him suddenly drop dead.

273
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,500
And I just couldn't bear
to have that happen, so…

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,833
First of all, he absolutely cannot
drink any alcohol.

275
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,458
And please don't let him run
or carry anything heavy.

276
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,083
And one more thing…

if he has sex…

281
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,333
it would put his life in danger.

[Saeko] Come to think of it,
what was that?

377
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,916
What was what?

378
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,208
The very first time I met Yusuke,
he played me a song,

379
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,291
"I Want You Back," here in the airport.

380
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:28,500
Though before that, he played this song
that was kinda strange.

381
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,500
Not a song, really, but a melody.

382
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,083
I wonder what it was he played.

383
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,208
When I was…

384
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
When he was…

385
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,458

seeing you for the first time.

[Kazu] You, uh,

388
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
seemed like you weren't doing great.

389
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,500
Or like you were upset.

390
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,625
You looked like
you didn't want to leave like that.

391
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:40,791
And you were crying.

392

[chuckles]

393
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,333
[Kazu] So I wondered

394
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,125
if there wasn't something I could do.

395
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,791
Then I saw the piano.

396
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,458
I wanted you to stop crying.

397
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,541
I wanted to cheer you up.

398
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,500
Because

399
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,083
not everything in this world is bad.

400
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,875
I wanted to tell you somehow,

401
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,208
so I…

402
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,541
Here, look.

403
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,500
I wanted to tell you a word…

Here.

506
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:29,958
Smell that.

507
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,875
Hmm? What is it?

508
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:33,625
That's something new.

[Shinoda laughs]

510
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,875

[conductor] Is there anyone
who doesn't have a passenger ticket

514
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,708
or is extending their ride
and needs to change their ticket?

WE'RE BUSY WITH APPLE PICKING
AND NEED MORE HANDS.

518

IT STARTS ON OCTOBER 6TH.
I WILL SEE YOU THEN.

519
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,250
What is she doing?

520
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,083
That's very strange.

So…

Get in.

But are you…

527
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,750
All right, I'm a bit lost.

528
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,291
What's happening?
What exactly are we doing?

529
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,458
What was the idea of having me come out?

530
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,333
Oh, uh, I texted you everything.

531
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,166
I need your help. It's our harvest season.

532
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,166
Yeah, I got that. I read what you wrote.

533
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,791
It's just that I don't understand
why you want me out here.

534
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,541
Well, you see, uh…

535
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:40,416
Mm, we really need a lot of workers,
so I thought, "Let's see."

536
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,791
"Is there anyone who owes me something
and needs to clear their debt

537
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,125
who might feel like
they owe me an apology?"

538
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,375
"If so, I'd get them to help me."

539
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,708
"Oh! I know who."

540
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,166
"Let me get Saeko."

There you go.

542
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,541
Okay.

543
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,125
And thanks for asking me.

00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,000
[Miki] Mm.

545
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,791
This favor's actually an annual one.

546
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,958
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

547
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,166
Well, once a year, I'd like to see you.
