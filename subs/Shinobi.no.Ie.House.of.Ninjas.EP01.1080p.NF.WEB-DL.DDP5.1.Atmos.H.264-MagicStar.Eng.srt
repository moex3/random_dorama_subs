00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,458
[man] You're eating.

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,916
Haru.

166
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,666
Come to work at the brewery.

167
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,458
[Haru] I told you I don't want to.

168
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,000
You will be in charge of it eventually.

169
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,125
I'm not cut out for it.

170
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,916
[woman 1] That's true.

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,458
Nagi can take over.

172
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,041
Brewing sake? No, thanks.

173
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm only interested in doing one thing.

174
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,166
[Riku] What?

175
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,208
[Riku] Come on, tell me.

176
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,125
[Nagi] You're the same. Right, Dad?

177
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,875
You're just a shinobi like I am.

178
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,458
Here. Do these too.

179
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,708
[Haru] Do 'em yourself.

-Oh. Who…

181
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,041
I'm gonna drop 'em.

182
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,541
Kyotani-kun, I'm done.

<i>-But what about class?</i>
-[Nagi] What about it?

186
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,375
We'll skip it.

187
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,333
-Mm-hmm.
-'K, bye!

188
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,333
-Want breakfast?
-[Haru] I already ate.

189
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,041
-See ya later.
-[Haru] I'm going to bed.

[man] Morning.

191
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,083
[woman 2] Morning.

192
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,541
Today's lucky color.

[chuckles]

194
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,208
[Riku] Mom.

195
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,791
Hmm? What is it?

196
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,625
Is our family very rich?

197
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,791
[laughing]

198
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,041
Why do you ask?

199
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,000
None of my friends
live in a house this big.

200
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,875
[mother] I guess we're lucky. Just Eat.

201
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,375
[Riku] Then are we poor?

202
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,041
[grandma laughs]

203
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,583
Riku, stop asking questions.
Eat your food.

204
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,083
-[Riku] Just one more.
-One more.

205
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,000
Am I adopted?

[laughing]

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,833
[sighs] What?

208
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,916
I think I'm different from everybody else.

209
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,041
You're the same. [clears throat]

210

Riku… [tuts] …you're normal.

211

Our whole family… are all the same.

213
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,625
[sarcastically] Normal, right. [laughs]

Hey! Hey!

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,416
We could fix up
the house with that pigeon.

226
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
You get that, right?

227
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,708
Next time, use the ladder!

228
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,916
Be normal.

229
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,916
What if someone sees you?

230
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,541
[sarcastically] Yeah. Normal, my ass.

What's this?

247
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,250
Apologies.

248
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,291
The brewery. It's over.

249
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
The funds won't even last to next year.

250
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,000
Uh…

251
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,333
-There has to be something we can--
-There is.

252
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,291
You can accept the subsidy
from the government.

253
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,375
Uh…

254
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,375
That's something we…

255
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,291
And why can't we?

256
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,208
Even though it's a public subsidy?

257
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,375
I've been trying to fix this
for six years.

258
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,625
I can't anymore. I can't.

259
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,333
Just give me a little time.

260
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,208
-All right?
-How much more time?

261
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,000
You have no funding, no plan.

262
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
And where's your successor, huh?

263
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,625
[moans]

264
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,333
These past 28 years have been a pleasure.

265
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,000
Nishio-san, please wait!

266
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,416
Someone's here to see you.

267
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,583
Ah, Tawara-san.
Hamashima, Cultural Affairs.

268
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,875
I came by to refresh you
about our agency's policy

269
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,833
on subsidies for the preservation
of cultural properties.

270
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,208
Excuse us.

271
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,750
-[man] Take a five.
-Oh. Yes, sir.

272
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,791
Let me introduce you to the new guy.

273
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,291
Oki, say hello.

274
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
Oki Masamitsu.

275
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,666
It's an honor to meet you.
I feel like I'm dreaming.

276
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,791
Are… are you real?

277
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm actually meeting a descendant
of the legendary Hattori Hanzo.

278
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,083
-I could die happy right now.
-Please stop that.

279
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,000
What do you want? Why are you here?

280
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,708
[Hamashima] I sent a carrier pigeon.
Did you get the message?

281
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,583
If I see another one of your pigeons,
I'll break its neck and feed it to my cat.

282
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,541
A new shinobi threat
has recently showed up.

283
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,166
The shinobi's are done!

284
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,375
I'm pretty sure we ended all the Fumas.

285
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,541
You're aware of
the pleasure cruise incident?

286
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,666
It looks like
a new kind of poison was used there.

287
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,916
Why don't you
just let the police handle that?

288
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
[Hamashima] It's too much for them.

289
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,250
I want you to come back to work for us.

290
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,833
Only shinobi can help.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,958
Get lost.

292
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,875
We're just a normal family now.

293
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,583
Is everyone satisfied then
with being a normal family these days?

294
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,333
What's that?

295
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,166
Your brewery is on its last legs, right?

296
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,250
What would Gaku think if he saw you now?

Why don't you say his name to me again?

301
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,916
The Tawara's are
the only ones who can help.

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,333
I have no intention
of putting my family in danger again.

303
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,666
-Sir, do you have a second?
-[man] Hmm?

304

[clears throat]

305
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,000
-They were just leaving.
-Yes.

306
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,750
I appreciate you taking
time out of your day.

307
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,708
Sorry.

308
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,875
You're late.

309
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,666
Sorry.

310
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,875
Wow, amazing!

311
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,166
[boy] Yeah, it is.

312
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,416
What are you… doing?

313
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,958
Nagi-chan.

314
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,833
Will you be my girlfriend?

315
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,500
[sighs]

316
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,458
Um, I can't.

[chuckles uncomfortably]

318
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,041
Why not?

319
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,083
It's not you, Kyotani-kun.

320
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,916
It's just

321
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,041
a rule.

322
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,333
A rule? What do you mean?

323
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,750
Sorry.

324
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,083
I don't really know how to explain it, but

325
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,125
I'm just a weirdo.

326
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,416
But I like that about you.

327
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,416
That's why I've been
skipping school with you.

328
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,166
And I'm eating less meat.

329
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,750
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,750
Can we just be friends?

331
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,208
[Kyotani] I thought you felt the same way.

-[woman] Excuse me.
-[employee] Yes?

335
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,458
[woman] Can you tell me
where I can find salt?

336
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,416
[employee] Oh, it's going to be
in aisle six.

337
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,833
[woman] Okay, thank you.

338
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,333
-[cashier 1] Thank you. Have a nice day.

Uh, excuse me. I need to get by.

00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,625
Sorry.

343
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,291
Come on.

[panting]

345
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,625
Excuse me. You dropped thi--

[tense music playing]

347
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,125
You passed.

348
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:16,125
That kindness of yours will help lead us
to the success of our solar eclipse.

349
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,708
It's almost time.

350
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,791
Wait for instructions.

[man 2] Hello, Detective.

-We're glad you're here.
-Ah.

Omi-san!

-[Omi groans] I think I'm cursed.
-Huh?

362
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,875
I said I was cursed.

363
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,750
I was hoping I wouldn't have to
deal with these steal-and-returns.

[groans, tuts]

It's probably gonna be
another black mark on my career.

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,250
I really wonder
what the point of all this is.

367
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,458
[Omi] Beats me.

368
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,666
Maybe some kind of training?

369
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,333
[woman] Training for what?

370
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,875
-[Omi] This?
-[woman] Yeah.

371
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,375
WILL BRING IT BACK IN 3 DAYS

[Omi scoffs]

373
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,208
I guess we wait.

00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,625
-Get the tent, huh?
-[chuckles]

375
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,583

-[Gaku] I knew you'd do it, Nagi.
-[laughs]

385
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,166
But the most important thing is…

386
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,166
[chuckles]

387
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:49,666
Is to sneak back in
and return it without getting caught.

388
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,708
[Gaku] Mm-hmm.

I could tell everyone what I did!

-You should be proud.

[Nagi] Hmm?

393

Shinobi becomes one with the shadows.

394

Nobody knows we exist.

But we are the defenders of this country.

Remember, don't skip training.

397
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,375
Yeah, I promise.

398
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,125
[Nagi] Don't tell anyone.

399
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,875
All right, Hanzo?

[mysterious music playing]

406
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,125
Okay!

407
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:24,833
-[cans clattering]
-[man 2] Your family runs a sake brewery.

408
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,333
Which means you can drink
as much sake as you want, huh?

409
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,583
[laughs] Hey, I'll take over
if you don't want it.

410
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,083
It sounds amazing.

411
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,083
[Haru] Go ahead
and knock yourself out, man.

412
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,708
Yeah, right!

413
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:39,083
If you're letting it go that easy,
I don't want it.

414
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,666
-[Haru] Why not? You can have it. Here.
-Oh.

415
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,500
Time to get it on with gyudon.

416
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,416
-[Haru] Yep. Let's go.
-Okay.

417
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,125
Huh?

[background music playing]

Is that the only thing you eat?

425
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,208
Huh?

426
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:08,541
I mean, are there other types of food
you like eating too?

427
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:13,250
Uh, well, I eat gyudon…

428
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,833
[chuckles] I, um…

429
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,500
I'm trying to ask you out.

430
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,291
Yeah.

431
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:21,916
What?

432
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,791
How's tomorrow?

433
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,458
-Uh, yes.
-[chuckles contentedly]

434
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,250
Can I…

435
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,125
Okay.

436
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,541
What are you in the mood for?

437
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,333
Something other than gyudon would be good.

438
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,958
-[giggles] Okay.
-[chuckles]

439
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,666
I'll call you, then.

440
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,500
-Thanks a lot!
-[employee] See you again!

[employee] Coming right up.

443
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,875
That smell's gonna stick.

444
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:19,833
Don't forget that both romance
and eating meat are against the rules.

445
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,958
That's really too bad. She is pretty.

446
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,875
Are you feeling lonely?

447
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,625
We can set you up with someone
who's been vetted if you want.

448
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,250
That's exactly what your parents did.

449
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,375
But you already knew that.

450
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:58,791
Or do you plan on…
maybe staying a virgin your entire life?

451
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,791
-[Haru] Thanks for the food.
-Thank you very much.

452
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,750
Your little crush is dangerous.

453
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,375
Let me show you

454
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,041
why she is here every night.

455
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,000
Hmm?

456
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,541
-[man] Haru.
-[knocking at door]

457
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:31,708

458
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:43,958
It's time.

459
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,958
Come to the brewery.

460
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,333
What are you talking about?

461
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,625
[man] You are taking over at some point.

462
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,375
Isn't the sake brewery just a front?

463
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,375
Give it up.

464
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,458
[man sighs]

465
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,666
It's been handed down through generations.

466
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,875
We can't survive without it.

467
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,791
Riku is still really young.

468
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:11,375
-There's school expenses…
-Ask someone else.

469
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,458
Haru.

470
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,750
You're my oldest son now.

471
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,833
I'm sure it's what

472
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:25,875
Gaku would want.

473
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,416
I'm not.

474
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,916
I can't replace Gaku, okay?

475
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,625
Whenever you are ready,

476
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,791
I will be waiting.
