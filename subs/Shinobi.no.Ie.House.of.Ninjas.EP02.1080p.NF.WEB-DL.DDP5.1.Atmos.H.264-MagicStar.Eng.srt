I'm telling you now.

I support ya!

48
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,541
[Yoko] I guess that's settled, then.

49
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,666
Riku, you went on a field trip today.

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,291
You had fun, right?

51
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,375
It was more than that.
Odawara Castle was the best.

And Fuma Kotaro was awesome!

53

I'll show you. He had shurikens,
and he threw them like this.

54
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,291
Then his sword went
ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, like this.

55
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,625
Punch, punch, kick!

Although you're wrong.

59

If Yoko-san was really a shinobi,
she'd be third-class.

Hmm? Remember.

A shinobi should always be careful
not to be caught.

You saw your mom.

64

That's why she's third-class.

we still need
to keep track of their reputation.

165
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,791
Is that what you do all day?
That's hardly working.

166
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,875
[Hamashima chuckles]

167
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,041
Uh, excuse me.

168
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,833
These gentlemen are…

169
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
Right. Our old members.

170
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,500
They were on a break,
but they're needed now.

171
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,458
You are?

172
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,583
-Oki.
-[man 1] And what do you do?

173
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,750
Oh. I was brought in
as a technology specialist.

174
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,041
I wanna help with their missions
by adding this technology

175
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,916
to the six tools of shinobi.

176
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,458
Shinobis are pretty stubborn.

177
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,916
They won't accept this right away.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,541
We can't be stuck in the past.
We need to change with the times as well.

00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,583
This is Kuze, known as the "Cleaner."

[Oki] Pleasure to meet you.

Change with the times?
Still using flying pigeons?

182
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,958
Carrier pigeons are
the best for communication.

183
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,375
They're small, they're incredibly swift,
and they elude hackers.

184
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,750
However, this technology
does what carrier pigeons cannot.

329
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,708
-[Haru] Shouldn't we call the police?
-[Karen] No.

330
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,750
I don't want us to become suspects.

331
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,875
I'm sorry for bringing you.

332
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,125
Who's that guy?

333
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,583
No idea.

334
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,000
I just went there to interview his family.

335
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,500
But now two people are dead.

336
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,791
So, uh, yeah, maybe you should stop here.

337
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,333
He had the same scar in the same spot.

338
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,375
Scar?

339
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,291
He had to have been the real killer.
The other guy was a scapegoat.

340
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,333
I'm willing to bet
his real target was Akiyama-san.

341
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,583
He also mentioned a yellow flower.

342
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,125
I'll help. Let's do this.

343
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,166
You've done more than enough.
I'll take it from here.

344
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,750
I can't leave you.

345
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,416
Because I wanna eat gyudon with you again.

-[Grandma] Hmm?

348
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,708
What was Gaku-niichan like?

349
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,291
Your brother was like the sun.

350
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:06,791
The sun?

351
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,833
Yes.

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,291
That's the best way to describe him.

353
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,250
Hot like a sweaty shoe?

-[Haru] I'm not here about your mission.

361
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,791
[Hamashima] Then why are you here?

362
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,375
[Haru] How long
have you been spying on her?

363
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:04,875
[Hamashima] You found out she's dangerous?

364
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:05,791
[Haru] That's not it.

365
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,291
-[Hamashima] Then what?
-[Haru] What aren't you telling me?

366
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:15,041
If you want to know, I'm sure
you can figure it out on your own.

367
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,666
You're a shinobi, aren't you?

368
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,541
Well?

369
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,458
Do you have something else,
or are we done here?

370
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,583
That's a woman's body
made to look like a suicide by hanging.

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,666
-There a suspect?
-The same killer from the club.

372
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,083
You should've
gotten rid of him that night.

373
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,416
A shinobi who can't kill. Hmm.

374
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:58,708
It's bad?

375
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,125
Yeah, that company really sucks.

376
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,541
They look down on me like a female peon.

377
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:09,041
A shinobi losing composure?
You're out of shape.

378
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,500
Since when have I had any composure?

379
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,375
Did you find the name of the survivor?

380
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,375
Anything?

381
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,375
I haven't found anything
on the passenger list yet.

Except there's a guy
I'm keeping an eye on.

383
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:26,708
[Hamashima] Okay.

384
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,291
Give me a call when you find something.

[mysterious music playing]

387
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:50,000
A puzzle box was recently stolen from
the Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Art.

388
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,166
Judging from previous cases,

389
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,666
it is very likely
that it will be returned.

390
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,375
The police are tightening security

391
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,958
as their intention is
to capture the thief in action.

392
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,875
As these serial steal-and-return cases
are highly unusual,

393
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,750
they have attracted media
and public attention.

You know what?
His wife was cheating on him.

426
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,208
She lied about having a part-time job
and stopped answering his calls.

She was banging her side piece instead.

they're going to show up?

If the thief went through the effort
to leave a note behind,

436
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,416
most likely, they're trying to show off.

00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,833
Who could it be?

438
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,541
Probably a young woman.

You're confusing me

Whatever. It's about time
we had some fun around here.

[Haru] What's "Gentenkai"?

446
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,833
[Karen] It's a new religious group.

447
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,833
They have 30,000 followers and growing.

448
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,541
Crazy.

449
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,375
Tsujioka Yosuke is the leader.
Most of his followers are younger.

450
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:59,291
He comes off as a naturalist
and addresses environmental issues.

451
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,500
He's super shady.

452
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,333
He holds a gathering every month.

453
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,541
You mean you're going?

454
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,791
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

455
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,250
Why?

456
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,833
"Why" what?

457
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,333
Why do you have to go so deep into it?

458
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,666
It's unsolved.

459
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,000
I get really curious.

460
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,041
There was an incident years ago.

461
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:38,541
[Haru] Mm-hmm.

462
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,666
A fire at a hotel.

463
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,458
Probably arson.

464
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,291
The hotel burned down.

465
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,500
They thought
all the hotel guests had died.

466
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,333
And then a three-year-old
was somehow found unharmed.

467
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,083
For some reason, no one tried
to figure out how it happened.

468
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,833
It's exciting.

469
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,083
The cruise incident reminds me of that.

470
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,791
It has to be a conspiracy.

471
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,958
[chuckles] Sounds like <i>Mu, </i>right?

472
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,208
And your job?

473
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,750
Are you passionate about vending machines?

474
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,500
Not exactly.

00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,416
I'm not cut out for my family's business.

but I'm procrastinating.

478
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
[Karen] Hmm.

479
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,000
I bet they're going to the event.

480

I'm still working. Get me a coffee.
Put extra sugar and milk.

00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,166
Absolutely, sir.

485
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,291
[mockingly] "Put extra sugar and milk."

486
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,708
As you wish.
