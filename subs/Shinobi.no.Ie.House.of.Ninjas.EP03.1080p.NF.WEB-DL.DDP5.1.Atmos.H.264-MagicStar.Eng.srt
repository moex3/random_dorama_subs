Do you travel all over the world?

163
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,291
No, I'm only working inside
the department of domestic sales.

164
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,333
[Yoko] Sure, but there are
so many wonderful places

165
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,708
to travel within Japan too, right?

166
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,500
Uh, I'm just the middleman
between all of our clients.

167
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,458
It's kind of boring. Yeah.

168
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,625
But I focus on my hobby on days off.

169
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,291
Jazz, right?

170
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,541
Yes.

171
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,916
I thought so.

IS YOUR PARTNER ACTING STRANGE?

00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,833
DID YOU KNOW?
INFIDELITY AMONG WOMEN IS ON THE RISE

177

That's not it.

00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,625
Hi, sir.

181
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,291
Uh… Yeah.

182
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,625
Yes?

So did your family agree
to be part of the magazine?

186
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,250
Yeah. All good.

187

That's great.

They're sending a crew

to cover the photo shoot.

190

Let's make sure all goes well.

-Oh. The title of the article…

-Title?
-Yes.

193
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:02,333
"Familial bonds give rise
to traditional flavor. Tawara Brewery."

194
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,666
Is it bad?

195
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,708
Great.

196
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,958
Great, Mayuko-kun.

197
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,041
Familial bonds.

198
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,583
It's nice.

199
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,208
You'll never believe it, Kuze-san!

200
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,166
I worked my first mission today,
and guess how it went?

201
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:29,958
Good luck.

202
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,333
[man 1] It's this one.
No, never mind. It's not.

203
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,041
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

204
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,208
Still got a lot to learn, rookie.

any kind of structure or anything?

[man 1] I think for a chance to be chosen,

221
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,333
you have to have
a change in consciousness or something.

[man 3 laughs] I understand how you feel.

231
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,125
I've been here two years
and haven't met him yet.

Although, I pray every day
that my turn is next.

But he is actually here, isn't he?

234
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,458
Of course he is.

235
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,333
Right here.

236
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,625

[professor] So when an externality
has a negative impact,

247
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,875
it's aptly called a negative externality.

248
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,750
When the impact
on the third party is adverse,

249
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,791
it's said that it has resulted
in a negative externality.

250
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,666
What does that mean in practice?

THE SCROLL IS TITLED "VISION OF CALAMITY"

What did you say?

257
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,166
It's not important.

258
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,625
[professor] In this case,
this particular unnamed company

259
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,791
imposed a negative externality
upon the local residents.

260

Excuse me, we're in class.

261
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,458
As I was saying, another example is

262
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,958
if there's someone making noise on a train

263
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,583
or on the street,
and it bothers others, it's a negative--

She must be your sister, right?

I'm not so sure.

Hey, kid, what do you mean?

309
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,000
I heard some kids get kidnapped
and then raised by somebody else.

310
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,916
And were you kidnapped?

311
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,541
I don't know.
Can you investigate that for me?

312
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,666
Maybe we can
after we find your older sister, okay?

313
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,916
How late does she stay out?

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,208
Really, really late.

315
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,166
Last time, it was 11:00.

316

Oh! You know what?

317
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,125
See that roof?

318
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:18,416
Over there. She ran across that roof
and went into that room.

319
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,416
[Omi] Oh.

320
