as the Fuma clan,

167
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,708
as well as to increase their membership,

168
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,458
they were operating as "Gentenkai,"
a religious group.

169
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,458
They have 30,000 members.

170
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,208
They've been drawing the younger crowd

171
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,750
by pretending to be
invested in the environment.

172
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,166
But in reality…

173
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,000
they're just a cult.

174
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,166
This is the Gentenkai headquarters.

175
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,041
There was confirmed activity
up until yesterday,

176
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,166
but when we checked this morning,

177
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,916
the whole place had been cleaned out.

178
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,333
It's completely deserted.

179
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,166
[Hamashima] We don't have any leads
to where they disappeared,

180
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,500
but I'm sure we can all guess
what they're up to.

181
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:39,833
The clues are there.

182
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,041
Next.

183
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,375
[Oki] Oh, right.

184
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,125
Sorry about that.

185
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,666
[tense music playing]

186
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,291
[music fades]

187
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,333
Just dropped my pen.

188
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,666
[intriguing music playing]

189
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,458
[Oki] This is the yellow flower obtained
from the Gentenkai headquarters.

190
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,625
Our analysis has shown that it contains
a brand-new type of neurotoxin.

191
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,291
Yoko-san investigated the incident
where we believe it was used.

192
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,791
It bears some resemblance to aconite,
but it is so much more toxic.

193
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,458
This toxin is almost impossible to treat.

194
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,583
[Hamashima] It's just the beginning.

195
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,375
The person behind these incidents

196
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,416
is the leader of Gentenkai.

197
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
Tsujioka Yosuke.

198
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,750
Also known as Fuma Kotaro the 19th.

199
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,500
Your son did a nice job investigating him.

200
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,583
You're telling me… you made contact?

201
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,208
Yes.

202
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,416
Some guy gave us a message today.

203
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,875
The message was,

204
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,416
"Thank you for saving my life
six years ago."

205
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,500
[Yoko] He said our son would tell us more.

206
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,875
Haru?

207
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,958
That night…

208
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,500
we were fighting the Fuma…

209
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,500
I had a… a chance to kill one.

210
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,708
But…

211
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,750
I didn't.

212
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,666
I couldn't kill him.

213
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,500
[Hamashima] Was he the 19th?

214
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,958
He was Gaku--

215
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,583
He murdered him.

216
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,958
[Soichi sighs]

217
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,916
Sorry I kept it to myself.

218
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,041
So your weakness brought about
the creation of the 19th--

219
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,166
Enough!

220
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,708
Stay out of this. It's a family matter.

221
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,000
[Riku] I know everything now.

222
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,416
[Yoko] Riku?

223
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,166
We're a shinobi house, right?

224
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,833
[Soichi] Riku.

225
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,625
Mom, did you tell…

226
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,125
Riku figured it out on his own.

227
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,208
[intriguing music playing]

228
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,958
Why did you keep it a secret?

229
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,833
[Soichi] Riku, it's not what you think.

230
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,291
I wish you would've told me!

231
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,625
[Yoko] Riku! [pants]

232
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,541
[Soichi] Hey!

233
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,625
[wistful music playing]

234
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,416
I hope you know…

235
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,333
it's not your fault.

236
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,250
You can't blame yourself.

237
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,458
-Open the door.
-[Riku] Go away!

238
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,166
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

239
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,958
There's a reason.

240
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,958
What was the reason, then?

241
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,166
[Soichi] I didn't want
to put you in danger.

242
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,125
It can't happen again.

243
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,291
I thought I was different from everybody.

244
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,791
[Riku sighs]

245
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,791
So can I be a shinobi?

246
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,291
Not gonna happen.

247
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,500
Riku, listen.

248
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,125
It's not so simple, you know?

249
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,875
[Soichi] It's not all fun and games
like you think it is.

250
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,458
You don't fly through the air
with a <i>furoshiki.</i>

251
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,875
[Yoko] And the clone duplicate technique?
Oof, overrated.

252
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,916
[Soichi] Plus, you don't get to eat
the hamburgers you love.

253
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,375
-So--
-I'm fine with that.

254
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,500
I wanna be a family.

255
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
[Yoko] What?

256
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,583
A real family.

257
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:49,458
I'm the only one who's not a part of it
because I'm not a shinobi yet.

258
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,708
Can I, please?

259
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,750
Can I please be a shinobi?

260
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,416
I'll work really hard.

261
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,166
Please. Can we be a real family?

262
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,375
All right.

263
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,500
Yes, yeah!

You took the scroll.

I'm so sorry.

269
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,625
You had your reasons.

270
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,625
But don't…

271
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,250

That scroll?

00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,125
What could that scroll be?

275
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:44,208
What could that scroll be?

276
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,833
Hmm?

[uneasy music playing]

283

You think you can kill me?

Here for revenge?

Make a move.

You've been quite

You even used your position
to come and go as you please.

And the stolen items were in your home.

Is there anything you'd like to say?

I was framed.

at all.

Okay.

So,

00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:44,166
is it true that you are a ninja?

Oh.

So do you use <i>shurikens?</i>

We don't use those.

They'd give us away.

Oh, right. You can't be discovered.

383
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,583
It's the number one rule that we have.

384
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,541
Having me here
is pretty much breaking it, right?

[Haru] Hmm.

Yeah, but

408
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,500
didn't you ask me out on a date?

409

Against the rules?

Pretty much, yeah.

I was going
to the gyudon place for work.

Arranged.
