There once was a baby
abandoned in this very forest.

00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,291
Right next to it

8
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,791
were the dead bodies of its parents.

9
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,916
They hung themselves.

10
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,916
They had left a suicide note,
wailing about the harsh world.

11
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,708
The parents didn't have the courage
to kill their baby.

12
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,583
So they just left it here to die.

Although,

14
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,416
the baby didn't die.

Over time, the parents' bodies
began to decompose.

16
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,375
The baby continued to cry
in this same spot.

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,333
The baby would never give in
to the destiny its parents had designed.

What allows one to survive
while the others die?

00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,666
It's the strength to take control

00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,375
Karen Ito.

169
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,416
Tawara Gaku. Nice to meet you.

170
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,958
Thank you for letting me stay,
even for a bit.

171
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,125
Glad you're here.

172
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,250
You know everything about us?

173
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,166
Maybe not "everything."

174
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,000
Uh, but yeah. I am aware.

175
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,625
She's hiding from the Fuma.

176
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,958
We're keeping it from Hama-san.

177
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,458
Yeah. [chuckles]

178
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,041
-Karen. Let's play Switch.
-Next time.

179
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,333
Oh, why next time?

180
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,000
Hey, Riku. Let's watch TV together.

181
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,500
Let's go.

182
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,875
[woman on TV] <i>Revitalize Japan!</i>

00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,375

190
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,791

[Riku] Why'd you turn it off?

193
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,541
Ah, because you still have
a lot of homework you need to finish.

194
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,708
[Riku] Okay.

195
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,708
<i>The politicians and bureaucrats in power,</i>

<i>I, Mukai Toko,</i>

199

<i>the politics of our country.</i>

201
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,791
<i>Our country will change</i>
<i>if the politics change.</i>

202
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,375
<i>Our stagnant economy.</i>

203
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,916
<i>Our diminished presence</i>

[uneasy music playing]

207
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,875
Six years ago, Mukai was kidnapped
during the gubernatorial election.

208
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,958
Now she's running for president.

209
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,041
I just have a bad feeling about this.

210
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,583
Also, um…

211
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,000
your brother.

212
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,166
The timing seems weird.

213
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,583
What do you mean by that?

214
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,083
[phone buzzing]

215
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,041
[buzzing continues]

216
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,125
SAWABE

217
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,708
Hello?

218
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,375
-What do you want? Why are you calling--
-[Sawabe] <i>They killed my family.</i>

219
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,125
I want revenge.

220
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,708
Why's a cop working for the Fuma?

221
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,208
The central government
is filled with Fuma collaborators.

222
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,583
Do you have information on the eclipse?

223
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,625
[Sawabe] <i>Yes.</i>

224
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,041
Tell me what it is.

225
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,833
I'll give you the information
if you help me kill that man.

226
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,750
[Haru] <i>Look, we want the same thing.</i>

227
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,666
Let's meet face-to-face.

228
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,041
I'm being tailed.

229
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,375
All right.

230
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,791
[Sawabe] <i>Where?</i>

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,416
[Haru] <i>Come out to Odawara.</i>

[door opening in distance]

235

[uneasy music playing]

236
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,458
[music fades]

237
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,041
We must have a rat.

238
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,333
But not to worry.

239
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,875
[laughs]

240
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,041
I've hidden it away. [laughing]

241
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,666
What are you doing?

242
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,041
[Gaku] Reminiscing.

243
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,416
You coming home

244
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,958
brought us all together
for the first time in a while.

245
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,583
You've always been
the core of this family.

246
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,083
When we were kids,

247
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,583
we were always in this room.

248
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,083
You were always slacking off.

249
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,750
I trained like my life depended on it.

250
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,916
Our skill level was the same.

251
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,041
If you actually tried,

252
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,000
I wouldn't have had a chance against you.

253
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,541
Why don't we give it a go?

254
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,625
What's the matter?

255
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,750
Everything is my fault.

256
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,500
I could've killed that guy.

257
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,916
I chickened out.

258
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,166
I just stood there.

259
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,958
I regret it all.

260
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,333
He's… he's the one who stabbed you, and…

261
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,708
he became Fuma Kotaro the 19th…

262
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,666
because… I couldn't do it.

263
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's…

264
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,208
You have always been kind…

265
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,416
but for shinobis…

266
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,750
kindness makes us weak.

267
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,458
When someone shows up and blocks you
from acting on your convictions,

268
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,458
you have to kill them.

269
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,208
If you blocked me, I'd kill you.

270
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,708
[chuckles softly]

271
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,666
Maybe you should stay
the way you've always been.

272
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,250
A bugging device?

273
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,500
Excuse yourself and plant it
while I explain the mission to everyone.

274
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,750
Gaku cannot know what you're doing.

275
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,541
I'm bugging the Tawaras?
No, no, no, no, no!

276
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,708
-Do you have a problem with this plan?
-I have a big problem!

277
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,041
That is a house of shinobis!

278
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm fully aware of that.

279
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,000
So what happens if they find out?

280
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,208
Do not get caught. Be very discreet.

281
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,000
[whimpers] I don't think
I can be discreet enough, Hama-san.

282
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,083
It's impossible. [whimpers]

283
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,666
[car door closes]

284
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,458
Why in the holy hell
is he making me bug them?

285
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,416
[whimpers]

286
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,208
[Hamashima] Hey! Move it!

287
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,958
Yeah! [whimpers]

288
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,708
[Oki] I'm gonna sue this guy someday.

289
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,750
-There.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,375
[Oki] It's heavy.

291
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,875
Come on. We don't have all day.

292
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,041
[Oki] Ow!

293
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,208
[Yoko] So, according to Matsuura,

294
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,333
the Fuma is planning
to carry out a mass murder.

295
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,041
[Hamashima] Unfortunately,
that idiot wasn't privy to the details.

296
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,958
What we do know

297
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:45,458
is that whatever plan they have
is named "Solar Eclipse."

298
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,125
The actual solar eclipse
occurs on November 9th.

299
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,208
In two days?

300
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,666
[Hamashima] Mm-hmm.

301
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:56,250
If they are, in fact,
carrying out their plan on that day,

302
00:24:56,958 --> 00:25:01,583
it is important that we locate them
in order to stop it before it starts.

303
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,958
Gaku drew this.

304
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,208
I was forced to work there
the entire time.

305
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,625
They warned me about
the toxicity of the yellow flowers.

306
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,500
They said that just breathing its pollen
could be lethal.

307
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:25,791
[Hamashima] I want you
to track and find this location.

308
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:35,166
Uh, sorry. Would it be all right
for me to use your facilities?

309
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,083
Right now?

310
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,958
Well, I've been holding it in for a while.

311
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,041
Uh, down the hall to the left.

312
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,541
Okay, thank you.

313
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,500
-Ah, can you do this?
-Okay.

314
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,375
Excuse me. Excuse me.

315
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:55,166
I was always blindfolded by them
before we got to the field,

316
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,750
but I could make out some things.

317
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:02,166
Like a fallen <i>torii</i>
and a broken stone staircase.

318
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,208
A fallen <i>torii?</i>

319
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,958
[breathes nervously]

320
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,416
[Oki sighs]

321
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:01,791
Yes!

322
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:03,375
[cat hisses]

00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,000
[hisses]

324
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,375
[Hamashima] <i>According to</i>
<i>what Gaku mentioned,</i>

325
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,000
the estimated location
of the flower fields is

326
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,041
around this area.

327

Gaku killed two Fuma members
in his escape.

Good luck.

What's my mission?

338
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:02,583
Nagi, your mission is to make sure
you take good care of me.

Don't you need to answer it?

Isn't she your head of sales?

Now's not the time for that.

Uh, a bit of a bummer kinda.

I checked and made sure
I wore your lucky color today.
