We decide why we kill and who we kill.

-[Kuze] Stop! Don't step off the sheet.

176
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,666
It'll make the cleanup harder.

177
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,916
The cleanup?

178
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,750
[Kuze] You, uh…

179
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,250
You found out
something you shouldn't have.

180

It's not ideal, but…

You saw me, right?

185
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,083
That man? Who was he?

186
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,333
You don't need to know that.

187

Stay away!

188
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,625
What's behind your back?

What is it?

Gaku-nii, um…

are you Fuma?

192

Nagi, don't be ridiculous.

193
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,625
Really?

194
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,750
That man you saw was Fuma.

[Gaku] Yes.

-He was messy.
-Drop your mask.

-Behind your back?
-It had to have been you.

207
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,791
You tricked my sister
by pretending to be me.

208
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,333
Were you planning
on never telling me that?

Answer me.

Where is it?

It won't be easy to find.
My grandmother must have stashed it.

The eclipse is coming. We don't have time.

Use force if you must.

My family won't be harmed.
You promised me that.

00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,333
That's if they had stayed hidden.

217

They've already been hostile to us.

This way.

230

Sorry about this.

Do you have any idea
of what you've done here?

Please spare her life.

I'll devote my life to the BNM.

I'll serve as a shinobi till I die.

235

I don't think you grasp
the situation you're in.

236

This is your end as well.

If you're willing to spare her life,

238

I'm willing to die.

If it's something I can't avoid.

[Yoko] It just looks like
a regular everyday truck terminal.

Maybe they're switching trucks
to transport it somewhere else.

247

Maybe.

All right, I'm going in.

Wait, can't we go in tonight?

You promise
that you'll never see each other again.

I promise.
