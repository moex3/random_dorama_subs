when you're gone.

I won't ask for the expensive stuff.

You're taking over the brewery, right?

504

[Haru] Uh…

505

That's great.
Family issue is all sorted out.

All right, wanna go
to our "Last Supper" together?

507
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:34,250
You can even order an extra-large.
It'll be my farewell gift to you.

I can't.

Oh. You're a vegetarian now.

Yeah, I guess.

00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,333
I walked past the shop the other day.

512
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,208
She was still in there.

513

Come on. Talk to her already.

514
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,541
I'm pretty sure you'd hit it off.

515
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:00,666
A great couple if you ask me.
