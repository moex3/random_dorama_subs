1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Mr. Tosaka.

2
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:06,867
How are you finding
your new full-commission employee?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,767
As expected,

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,800
he's quite the go-getter.

5
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,166
Thank you.

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,000
I hope the tiger isn't too aggressive
in this Tiger Balm.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,367
-Kiriyama.
-Yes?

8
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:25,266
Thank you for everything thus far.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,333
How can I ever repay you?

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
Well,

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,734
perhaps you could order me
something sweet from here, like--

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,667
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,567
I didn't realize.

14
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:47,133
Please. Take your time.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Kiriyama.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,033
QUEEN OF REAL ESTATE
MADAM

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,567
Was it something I said?

18
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,400
He must have taken it the wrong way.

19
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:00,900
Of course.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Here. Have a seat.

21
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:12,300
How is he, by the way? That boy of mine.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,567
How is Kento doing?

23
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,567
KENTO TOKAGE
GEN Z SALES

24
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,033
So you've been accepted
into Hitotsubashi University.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,633
In that case, I'd recommend this property,
as it has no transfers for your commute.

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,133
That's nice,

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,467
but I'd really like to live in Yaoki
while I'm in Tokyo.

28
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,133
I used to come here a lot
when I was in Saitama.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,633
FIVE MINS. ON FOOT
FROM YAOKI STATION

30
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:43,467
Sorry to be a bother.

31
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,367
SHINGO AOE

32
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,800
My parents were always on my back
during this interim.

33
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,433
FIRST YEAR COLLEGE STUDENT
RENTAL CONSULTATION

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Please, take all the time you need
to consider your first solo apartment.

35
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,066
I knew it!

36
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,200
You have a good eye!

37
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,333
KEISUKE KUROSU
REAL ESTATE SALESMAN

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,033
I knew this would be a winner.

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,633
Perfect for your first time on your own,
and Mom can rest easy.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,734
I knew it!

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,700
See, Mom? Mr. Kurosu says it's fine.

42
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,667
A big, obnoxious voice
isn't going to persuade them.

43
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:10,967
I agree!

44
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,633
-I want her somewhere safe.
-Of course.

45
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,066
It's over budget, but please?

46
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,100
Shall I arrange all the paperwork?

47
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,667
-Let's do it!
-Hooray!

48
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,000
He did it!

49
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,166
-Here.
-Thank you.

50
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,734
Right. I've made up my mind.

51
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,400
Great.

52
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:25,467
Can we see it again?

53
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,834
Okay.

54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Dang, how can I make him make up his mind?

55
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,033
Consider it from the money side of things.

56
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,600
They're all within your budget,

57
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,400
but in terms of facilities
and proximity to the station,

58
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,934
will you find something better than this?

59
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,000
Because I think you will.

60
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,066
I've handpicked all of these properties,

61
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,133
but I won't stop until you're satisfied

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,567
so let's get out there
and see more properties!

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,433
Come on. Let's go.

64
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
What?

65
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,467
RENTAL APARTMENT
AMBITIOUS YAOKI

66
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,300
I just need one more month.

67
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:08,400
Then I'll be able
to back pay for two months.

68
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,400
CONSULTATION
REGARDING RENTAL ARREARS

69
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,533
Two months?

70
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:15,467
I got a new job, so I promise!

71
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:17,800
Miss Kiyokawa.

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,867
Can you tell me
why you're three months in arrears?

73
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:26,333
I thought everything was all right
when I found this place for you.

74
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,266
ASUMI KIYOKAWA
THEATRICAL PERFORMER

75
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,467
I couldn't get enough hours at work
until just last month.

76
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,533
LIAR ROMEO AND HONEST JULIET

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Don't tell me…

78
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,166
ASUMI KIYOKAWA

79
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,300
It's you!

80
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,900
You're with Honnami Theater?

81
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,700
Yes, but it's only a minor role.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,734
You said you'd always dreamed
of performing with Honnami Theater.

83
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,533
That's why you came to the big city.

84
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,867
I'll bet your parents are thrilled.

85
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,233
Yeah.

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,166
They've always had your back.

87
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:10,867
I've got a long way to go.

88
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,367
I've finally got
another big audition lined up.

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,834
And so,

90
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,133
I can't lose my home right now.

91
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,834
I'm back.

92
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,033
Welcome back.

93
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,367
What's up, Tsukishita?

94
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,033
Well…

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,066
I just had an arrears consultation.

96
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,567
It's an all-inclusive studio apartment
at 59,000 yen a month.

97
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,934
AMBITIOUS YAOKI
RENT 59,000 YEN

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,133
It's a great property,
the best in the area,

99
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:54,133
but the tenant
is now three months in arrears.

100
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,266
I see.

101
00:04:55,333 --> 00:05:00,433
And beyond three months,
the owner can issue eviction proceedings.

102
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,033
They're not in a good place right now.

103
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
EVICTION PROCEEDINGS

104
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,867
COURT GETS INVOLVED
IN ORDERING A TENANT TO VACATE

105
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,400
I want to be able to help.

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,400
It's just that "customer first"
is very hypocritical.

107
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,934
No.

108
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,934
I'll do my best.

109
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,166
Hello?

110
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,567
Yes, it's good to hear from you.

111
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,233
Yes.

112
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,233
And that's a done deal!

113
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,500
KEISUKE KUROSU

114
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,166
-Wow.
-Impressive.

115
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,900
Nagase. Better watch your back
or you'll lose the upper hand.

116
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,400
That's full commission
for you right there.

117
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:49,867
-Full commission?
-Yeah.

118
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:50,934
What's full commission?

119
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,133
Full commission means everything I earn
comes through commission.

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,367
Like a freelance partnership
with Tosaka Real Estate.

121
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,967
That sounds like a sweet deal.

122
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:05,734
However, Kurosu must pay for all branded
business cards out of his own pocket.

123
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Business gifts
are also at his own expense.

124
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,500
If he wants to use our photocopier,
that's 10 yen per page.

125
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,800
But here's the kicker!

126
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,533
SALARY-BASED - FULL COMMISSION

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,900
Unlike us salary-based employees,

128
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,900
his income is capped only by his results.

129
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,166
Compared to us, he gets a 60% commission
on sales at Tosaka Real Estate.

130
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,600
The sky's the limit!

131
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,934
Or you could end up with nothing.

132
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,834
Of course, some of us are out there

133
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,467
enjoying the high-rise life,
even without being on full commission.

134
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,767
Yeah, the high rise.

135
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,934
I'd love to see how you do it.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,867
I can do it whenever--

137
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,367
Say it, hero.

138
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:48,734
Not so straight and narrow now, are you?

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,567
Tell him, Nagase!

140
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,834
I'll get there soon, you'll see.

141
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,066
Hello, Saichi Nagase
from Tosaka Real Estate.

142
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:02,100
You should think
about full commission, Tokage.

143
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,166
Buy yourself a watch,
a car, whatever you like.

144
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:10,100
And just watch all the girls flock to you.

145
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,367
I don't care about that.

146
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,433
But…

147
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,300
This will be your second viewing.

148
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll lock it in.

149
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:22,433
I'd like to schedule a time
to speak directly with the owner.

150
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,367
Sounds like time well spent.

151
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,467
TIM - TIME IS MONEY

152
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,934
Major respect.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,233
You know it.

154
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Finger snap? Really? Yes, well done.

155
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,734
THE HONEST REALTOR 2

156
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:44,200
Here. Leaflets for our newest additions.

157
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,266
Give them a good check.

158
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,834
EP 6 OF 10
COMING INTO FULL BLOOM

159
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,567
All the first-year students
and new employees come out in the spring.

160
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,433
Can't this all be digital?

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
Who uses paper anymore?

162
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,600
The real estate industry

163
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,767
stands resolute in its old,
fuddy-duddy ways.

164
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,100
Listen up.

165
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
These leaflets

166
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:10,600
are a sacred relic of the ingenuity
of realtors over the decades!

167
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,900
Only paper can give you
that certain sense of warmth!

168
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,800
The age of analog is not over yet!

169
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,767
Hey, Nagase, can I ask you something?

170
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,967
One of my landlord friends is in a bind.

171
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:31,000
It seems one of his tenants
is constantly in arrears.

172
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:33,300
He wants the money, or he wants them out.

173
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,367
RENTAL PAYMENT HISTORY

174
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:37,000
Either way, he wants this resolved
as soon as possible.

175
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,800
Can't the rental
guarantor company handle it?

176
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,700
Well, this guy's pretty old-fashioned.

177
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,967
He approved the rental agreement

178
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,233
with just a relative as guarantor
to bypass a guarantor company.

179
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,200
What is this landlord, a dodo?

180
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,233
Can you help me, Nagase?

181
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Well…

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Mr. Nagase.

183
00:08:57,734 --> 00:09:00,066
I need your advice.

184
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,834
First him, now you.

185
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,133
I'm about to go and see the landlord
for that client of mine who's in arrears.

186
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,900
In arrears?

187
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,333
May I ask which property it is?

188
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,166
It's Ambitious Yaoki.

189
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,133
Ambitious Yaoki?

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,700
That's it, Nagase!

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,100
The owner is Mr. Inoguchi.
He's the one I need to help.

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
What?

193
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:24,000
This is perfect! Two birds with one stone.

194
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,934
How is this perfect?

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,934
The landlord and the tenant
are at complete odds with each other.

196
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:32,300
What do you mean?

197
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,266
I see how it is.

198
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,200
You knew Tsukishita would take
the tenant's side,

199
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,567
and you knew it would complicate things
so you come crawling to me.

200
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:45,133
Nagase. You owe me a favor, remember?

201
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,400
I can introduce you to someone who
may like to purchase the Omiya property.

202
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,333
You owe me one.

203
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,300
So,

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,400
does this mean you'll help?

205
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:07,934
Thank you so much.

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Appreciate it.

207
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,734
We've gotta try.

208
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,667
HARUKAZE BENTO - FRESH
AND DELICIOUS LUNCHES TO GO

209
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,033
Hello!

210
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,266
One Harukaze Bento.

211
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,400
Got it.

212
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:25,900
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

213
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,166
Have a great day!

214
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,767
-Asumi.
-Yeah?

215
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,333
Go take your break.

216
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Sure.

217
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,767
Hey, what happened with your rental?

218
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,967
My realtor's a big help.
She said she'll fix it for me.

219
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,133
Thank goodness for that!

220
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,734
I'm rooting for you!

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,066
Thank you.

222
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,400
If you could just grant
Miss Kiyokawa one month's grace,

223
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,767
she said she'll be able
to pay back two months' rent.

224
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,934
HISAO INOGUCHI
OWNER OF AMBITIOUS YAOKI

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
Another month to pay two?

226
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,333
She's already three months late.

227
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,467
Are you able to be
just a little more patient?

228
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,367
Well,

229
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,700
I do like the idea
of kids chasing their dreams.

230
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,600
I could wait.

231
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,533
Then you understand!

232
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,834
You know,

233
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:20,734
friends have told me
I'm too nice to people.

234
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:25,400
I only get by
on what people pay me in rent these days.

235
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:27,633
So, which is it?

236
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,767
If your tenant
is more than three months in arrears,

237
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:37,133
and if you've sent a final notice by
registered mail and they still can't pay,

238
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,800
you are within your rights
to evict her through the courts.

239
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:42,867
Hey.

240
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,934
Why would you say that?

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,967
I said it to Mr. Fujiwara myself.

242
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:51,000
I'd hate to have to evict
a guest through the courts.

243
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,667
GUEST = TENANT

244
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:54,633
-So, which is it?
-Which is it?

245
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,734
Well, I'm supposedly a very generous man,

246
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,567
but I'm also a man who does things
the old-fashioned way.

247
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,066
I get you.

248
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,033
You don't wanna lose out,
and you don't wanna lose face.

249
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,500
You worry about what people think.

250
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,567
What did you say?

251
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,900
Tokage, how could you say that
to Mr. Inoguchi…

252
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,867
He didn't mean--

253
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:19,166
…before I got a chance to say it myself!

254
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,133
-Mr. Nagase!
-I'm right, aren't I?

255
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,333
Nobody who's generous goes around
calling themselves generous.

256
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,300
Mr. Tokage! Be quiet!

257
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,300
Yes. Zip it, and let me have a turn.

258
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,467
-What?
-Mr. Inoguchi.

259
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,367
Are you familiar with this old saying?

260
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:36,734
"Lord as to the serf.

261
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
Landlord as to the renter,"
or here, your "guest."

262
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,266
This saying has existed
since the days of yore.

263
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Yes, I know it!

264
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:48,033
Back then, landlords took responsibility
for the young people in their care.

265
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,867
They were concerned for their grades,
employment, and fiscal standing!

266
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:54,266
But you, you're evasive and only concerned
about your own standing!

267
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,567
You? A landlord? Fat chance!

268
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,300
That's it!

269
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,100
Now I don't even want her money!

270
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,867
Now, I want her out!

271
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,400
Please, Mr. Inoguchi--

272
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,433
Don't like it?

273
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,433
Then make her pay up
everything she owes right now!

274
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,033
AMBITIOUS YAOKI

275
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,066
I know, but I'm not a child anymore, Ma.

276
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:26,467
FRUITS FROM HIROSHIMA

277
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,333
I can buy these things myself.

278
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't need to worry about me.

279
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,567
I'm not pushing myself too hard.

280
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,667
And what about you?

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,467
GOOD LUCK, ASUMI!
MOM'S ROOTING FOR YOU

282
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,934
Are you doing well?

283
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,567
HARUKAZE BENTO

284
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,633
Here you go.

285
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,300
-Thanks.
-Have a great day!

286
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,367
-Asumi.
-Yeah?

287
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:58,934
-Can you get the fryer?
-Sure.

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
Sorry, please wait.

289
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,300
Thank you. You may proceed.

290
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,934
Thank you.

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,300
Miss Kiyokawa couldn't get
any time off work again today.

292
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,100
Just call and explain everything for now.

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,900
It's up to her to decide.

294
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,834
But we really should
speak in person for this.

295
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,200
We're breaking
some terrible news to her, after all.

296
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:25,266
Shall we try and visit her at night then?

297
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,867
I don't do overtime.

298
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,734
Mr. Tokage.

299
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:35,333
Miss Kiyokawa is working day and night
to pay back what she owes.

300
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,100
What's one day of overtime to you?

301
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:38,767
It's all right.

302
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:43,934
Didn't you ever hear the story
of The Ant and the Grasshopper?

303
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:45,934
And?

304
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,367
The grasshopper was all vibes…

305
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,433
VIBE = CHILL OUT

306
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,066
…and so the hardworking ant won.

307
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,967
I'd say I'm the ant here.

308
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:54,967
How?

309
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,500
I clock out on time every single day.

310
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,467
Your client is off
chasing some fanciful dream,

311
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,734
working on-and-off hours at dead-end jobs.

312
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,533
Isn't that what a grasshopper would do?

313
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,800
Whatever.

314
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,500
There they go again.

315
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:16,100
Putting out fires
is the biggest waste of time.

316
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes! Major respect.

317
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Excuse me.

318
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:26,200
Mr. Kurosu, you have a complaint.

319
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
A complaint?

320
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,500
You too, Mr. Nagase.

321
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,166
What's wrong?

322
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,600
We went to the same cram school.

323
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,667
Now we're in the same college.

324
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,900
We were excited to be living
in Tokyo together…

00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,433
…and then we found out
we'd be in the same building.

328
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,266
We'd both be paying 90,000 yen.

329
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,133
So, why are our up-front costs
so different?

QUOTE

331

Whoops.

335
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:06,700
Allow me to apologize.
This has clearly been my mistake.

336
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,000
Mistake?

337
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:15,266
I'm so sorry to have made you
come all this way.

338
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,200
I will issue the refund immediately.

339
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,133
If this is a mistake, then scam callers
are simply calling the wrong number!

340
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,533
Let me see.

341
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:33,467
I knew it.

342
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:39,500
I can tell you exactly why
your up-front costs are so different

343
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,400
despite having the same building,
same layout, and same rent.

344
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Please do.

345
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,900
This leaflet contains
all the information you need

346
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,867
when selecting a rental.

347
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,934
This is what I gave to Mr. Aoe.

348
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,000
This is what you got, Mr. Katagiri.

349
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Can you spot the difference?

354
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,667
It's an ad.

355
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,467
An advertising fee.

356
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,033
Advertising fee?

357
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,667
We call this an advertised property.

358
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,867
Let's break it down.

359
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:23,266
An advertised property

360
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,967
is one where a landlord or a company
has paid a fee to the brokerage agency,

361
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,734
almost like a "good luck" fee,

362
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,800
so that the agency can find a tenant
as quickly as possible.

363
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,633
The agency makes money from the agreement

364
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,734
without having to charge
the tenant any fees.

365
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:45,767
That's why Mr. Aoe's quote doesn't have
a brokerage fee.

366
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,600
Mine doesn't have AD.

367
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,133
AD: 200 - NAGASE'S CLIENT
KUROSU'S CLIENT

368
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,734
So, does that mean
I also don't need to pay the fee?

369
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,233
That's right.

370
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:00,400
You did this on purpose.

371
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,567
Can you prove it?

372
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,333
I cannot.

373
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,600
But if we look at your tablet…

374
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,367
You two! Stop that. You're with clients!

375
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:15,934
Sorry for that display.

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,800
I'm the Head of Sales here.

377
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:22,000
I must apologize for that brazen display
by my employees.

378
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,800
Make sure you return the money.

379
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,233
-Sorry about that.
-Whatever.

380
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,734
You photoshopped the leaflets, didn't you?

381
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,433
You did it so you could double your fees.

382
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,867
Even if that were true,

383
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,834
whether it's advertised or not,

384
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,800
there's no rule that says
you can't take a brokerage fee.

385
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,600
We try not to accept them
for advertised properties!

386
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,166
Is that so?

387
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,100
Thanks for the heads-up.

388
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,934
Nagase, that's enough.

389
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,867
Your clients are waiting.

390
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:49,934
Kurosu. Follow me.

391
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,500
Well, that was a waste of time.

392
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,133
You. Get out there
and hand out some tissues.

393
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,467
I'm on lunch break.

394
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,700
-Look here--
-Mr. Nagase, that's harassment.

395
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I mean, whatever.

396
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,767
It's not like I've had a hard day.

397
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:18,967
Glad you got a refund.

398
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,667
Good thing we're careful.

399
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,700
What shall we do now?

Were you aware of this, sir?

404
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,367
This is our reputation online.

405
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:57,734
Kamiki may be bringing in the money,
but he's damaging our reputation.

408
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,133
It's the most famous.

409
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,834
So, what if we've got a bad name?

410
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:15,066
These days,
a bad name is better than no name.

411
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,367
Come in.

412
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,066
I have something for you.

413
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,567
Well then.

414
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,467
Let's see who wins.

415
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:31,767
A bad name.

416
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,867
Or no name.

417
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,500
I'll leave our new Tachikawa store to…

418
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Here.

419
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Here.

Hello?

423
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,000
What can I get you?

425
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,500
I'd like a salmon rice ball,
and a kombu rice ball.

426
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,100
And I'll have a tea.

427
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,934
Sure. Won't be a moment.

That'll be 465 yen.

431
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,533
Sure.

432
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,934
Here you are.

433
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,433
Thank you.

434
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,600
Have a great day!

435
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:15,266
Cheer up, Mr. Nagase.

436
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:23,000
Home time. See you.

437
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,967
-See ya.
-Bye.

438
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:48,066
Nagase. Nagase!

439
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,867
I'm going home on time today.

440
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,467
Pack your things.

441
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:54,467
Madam just called.
She's invited you to dinner.

442
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,600
Madam did?

443
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,066
Mr. Nagase, come on.

444
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,967
-Is something wrong?
-Miss Tsukishita, you go too.

445
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,700
Over there. Please, go ahead.

446
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,667
It's fine.

447
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:16,867
-Mr. Tokage?
-You have it.

448
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:22,567
Do you think this is to find out
how you've been training Mr. Tokage?

449
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,300
Could be.

450
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Wow, that's good.

451
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,600
Do you often eat
such lavish meals with Madam?

452
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,133
Sometimes.

453
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,633
I have been stood up before.

454
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,066
Well, he is a very important person.

455
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,233
So I don't often get to hear
how he's doing these days.

456
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,233
How is he at work?

457
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,533
He's learning a lot from me.

458
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,233
I'm learning more from Kurosu.

459
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,100
What ever do you mean?

460
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,633
Kurosu doesn't waste his time.

461
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,734
Waste of time, waste of time.

462
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,800
Kurosu cheated his client

463
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,166
to get more money out of them.

464
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,734
You mean that complaint today?

465
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,200
He can kick up a stink,

466
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,300
but his rent and tuition
will still come from daddy's pockets.

467
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,266
That's no reason to crush people's dreams
just as they come to the big city.

468
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,233
Dream, or whatever.

469
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,834
He's the type to not even realize
he's won the lottery of life.

470
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,367
I think it served as a good lesson.

471
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,467
Mr. Tokage.

472
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
It's just as Mr. Nagase said.

473
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,834
"Lord as to the serf.
Landlord as to the renter."

474
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,100
But that relationship has broken down
these days.

475
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,667
It's up to us as realtors
to come to the tenant's rescue.

476
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,000
With our jobs, we can help people.

477
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,800
You can never really help someone,
can you?

478
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,667
That's not true.

479
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:31,900
I think we've killed the vibe here.

480
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:33,734
I'm leaving.

481
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,367
Madam. Can I ask you something?

482
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:45,734
Why is Mr. Tokage such a little brat?

483
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,767
-I know he's Gen Z, but--
-Stop.

484
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:49,734
It's my fault.

485
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,500
What?

486
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,100
I don't mean to brag,

487
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,200
but Kento's grandfather, my late husband,

488
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:04,100
he was head over heels for me.

489
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,233
So much so that
he even went into debt to spoil me.

490
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,767
He didn't seem to care at all

491
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:22,533
for the son he'd had with his ex,
or his son's family.

492
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,533
I learned all this after the fact,

493
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,867
but apparently his son

494
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,233
had to deal with the aftermath
of all of his debts.

495
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,066
Mr. Tokage! I know you're there. Pay up!

496
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,133
DUNNING LETTER

497
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,533
15 YEARS PRIOR

498
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,066
Kento's mother

499
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,033
fell ill prematurely and passed away.

500
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,533
We'll be back.

501
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,233
-I'm scared.
-You better be ready!

502
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,667
He lived alone with his father.

503
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,300
KENTO AND HIS FATHER

504
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,433
Come on, Kento. Let's eat.

505
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,400
Kento's father had a positive attitude,
and was a hard worker.

506
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,033
They're gone now.

507
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,166
-But he was never rewarded for it.
-It's okay.

508
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:07,734
Kento! It's all right, Kento!

509
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,734
He passed away before he got that chance.

510
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
See?

511
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:22,033
After that, Kento was shuffled
from family member to family member.

512
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
I must have first met him

513
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:28,000
about two years ago now.

514
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,567
I didn't know how to approach him.

515
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:37,166
I wouldn't be surprised

516
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,767
if he resents me.

517
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,467
But

518
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:49,333
what if he resents his parents too?

519
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,967
I couldn't bear the thought.

520
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I know he must be
very difficult to handle.

521
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
No.

522
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,233
I'll step up to the plate.

523
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,533
I'll turn him into a real realtor.

524
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:13,834
I promise.

525
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,300
I'll do my best too.

526
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:23,533
Thank you.

527
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:34,533
Sorry, please wait.

528
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:37,767
Come on through.

529
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,500
You may now cross.

530
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,367
Thank you.

531
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,400
Sorry, please wait.

532
00:28:58,467 --> 00:28:59,800
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

533
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,000
It won't be long.

534
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:02,967
Have a great day.

535
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,500
ASUMI KIYOKAWA

536
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,200
Sorry, please wait.

537
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:10,500
-How long is this going to take?
-Thank you.

538
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,567
Gimme a break.

539
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Tokage.

540
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,000
Miss Kiyokawa from Ambitious Yaoki
has some time available.

541
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,800
We're going to discuss her late rent.

542
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,333
You need me too?

543
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,633
Of course we do.

544
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,900
"Every one of us here
is merely impersonating another.

545
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,767
If that is discomforting,
please just think of it as a dream."

546
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,533
"Every one of us…"

547
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,166
"Every one of us here
is merely impersonating another.

548
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,700
If that is discomforting,
please just think of it as a dream."

549
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Hello.
Sorry to make you come out all this way.

550
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,066
It's fine.

551
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,600
We're not too far from my next shift here

552
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,934
and I don't get much time
to practice for my audition.

553
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,467
About you being in arrears.

554
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:26,100
You have a parent as guarantor.

555
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:29,633
Can you ask them to pay what you owe?

556
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,433
Sorry, that's all we could do.

557
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,734
I know it's not what we wanted.

558
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,100
Unfortunately, as it stands,

559
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:43,433
you're only relying
on the generosity of your landlord.

560
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:47,767
I'm sorry.

561
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,200
It may be that you'll need to move out

562
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:55,734
and get back on your feet
living with your parents again.

563
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:07,934
My parents run a fruit farm
in the countryside.

564
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:11,166
If I'm being honest,

565
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,734
I have thought about

566
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:18,033
moving back in with them
over this past year.

567
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,500
They're getting old,

568
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:24,900
and I know they're struggling.

569
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,734
But then…

570
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,333
I got the part with Honnami Theater.

571
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
And my parents…

572
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:43,000
they were so happy for me.

573
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,300
I could tell they were crying

574
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,734
as I told them over the phone.

575
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,266
GOOD LUCK, ASUMI!
MOM'S ROOTING FOR YOU

576
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,166
I can't go back.

577
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,867
I've already decided this.

578
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,367
Okay.

579
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,667
I'll speak to the owner again.

580
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,166
Seriously?

581
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,266
What a waste of time.

582
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,300
Miss Kiyokawa.

583
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,734
You're not paying your rent.

584
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,700
You need to quit talking about your dreams
and just get the hell out of there.

585
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,834
You're just wasting all of our time here.

586
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:40,700
Mr. Tokage.

587
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Tokage.

588
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,700
I know you kids these days,

589
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,667
I know you like to prioritize your time--

590
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,600
But you sound like a dumb parrot squawking
"waste of time, waste of time" on repeat!

591
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,433
On repeat!

592
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:05,100
Many so-called "wastes of time"
are, in retrospect, meaningful.

593
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:09,133
We know this, but you're so scared to fail
that you just turn tail and scram!

594
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,200
Someone like you…

595
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,300
I'll turn him into a real realtor.

596
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you.

597
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,333
…should just quit.

598
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Fine. I will.

599
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,200
What?

600
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,967
Mr. Nagase!
What about your promise to Madam?

601
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,333
Wait!

602
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,433
Why should I give up on my dream
just because I can't afford my rent?

603
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,500
What?

604
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,600
Did I say that?

605
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,734
What?

606
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
Yes, you did.

607
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:03,900
I meant the opposite.

608
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:06,633
The opposite?

609
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,400
What I meant to say

610
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,567
is you're better off leaving that place
if you want to follow your dreams.

611
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:18,400
Miss Kiyokawa.

612
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,800
You're working day and night
just to pay back what you owe.

613
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Even that's not enough.
You still owe money.

614
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
What's more,

615
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,834
you don't have any time
to practice your performances.

616
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,266
-Yes.
-You're wasting your--

617
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,767
Wait, maybe not.

618
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,834
The landlord wants you out,

619
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,867
and will forgive what's owed
in order to get you out.

620
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:59,533
So that only leaves one alternative…

621
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I get it.

622
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,834
Thank you so much for clearing that up--

623
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,100
I take it back!

624
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,533
How's the client going to understand that?

625
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,066
Use your words more.

626
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,567
Don't just call things a waste of time!

627
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,800
Let me translate for Tokage.

628
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,133
What he means to say is
you should move out

629
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,900
and find a cheaper place to rent.

630
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,233
He means that is your only option here.

631
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,433
But it's not that the rent is unaffordable
for Miss Kiyokawa.

632
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,600
Only in accordance with the theory that
rent should be one third of your income.

633
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,100
That theory is outdated.

634
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:48,233
Prices are always going up these days,
but incomes aren't keeping up.

635
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,533
Rent going above one third
of your income is absolutely possible!

636
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,333
One quarter.

637
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,000
One quarter.

638
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,767
I recommend one quarter of your income.

639
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:03,500
That way, you can chase your dreams
without being a prisoner to your rent.

640
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:07,700
You need to balance your work time
so you can devote yourself to the stage.

641
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:10,033
-Wouldn't you agree, Tokage?
-That's right.

642
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:14,500
But if she does that…

643
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,934
I'd have to find a place
in the 40,000 range.

644
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,567
There are plenty of places like that.

645
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,500
But,

646
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:28,800
she's female, so she has to consider
things like security, for example.

647
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,166
I'm pretty sure I've seen some.

648
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:34,967
They'd be in those leaflets
you made me memorize.

649
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
Wait.

650
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,300
I remember when I was entering them
into the computer today.

651
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,200
CHALEUR YAOKI

652
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,500
There it is.

653
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:50,567
STUDIO APARTMENT

654
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,834
It's far out, and the lighting is poor,

655
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,266
but it's recently renovated
and not that bad of a place.

656
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:00,233
It's also had
new security cameras installed.

657
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,667
45,000 yen, management fees included.

658
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,100
Yes. This is the one.

659
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,667
Ticks all the boxes.

660
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:10,467
Thank you so much!

661
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:19,266
Hey, it's not that big of a deal.

662
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,767
You can stand up now.

663
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
What's wrong?

664
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,834
I knew…

665
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:47,000
it was too much
to ask of you, Miss Tsukishita.

666
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:52,200
But I didn't want to give up.

667
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,567
I couldn't tell my parents.

668
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,367
I was a nervous wreck all day, every day.

669
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,967
But now, thanks to you all…

670
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,834
I've never been so happy.

671
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,200
Thank you for all your help.

672
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,233
Take care.

673
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,367
You too.

674
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:46,567
Good luck!

675
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:50,800
Mr. Tokage.

676
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:55,533
Thank you for helping Miss Kiyokawa.

677
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,934
It's not like I wanted to help her.

678
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:01,200
Then what did you want?

679
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:07,233
I just think you should take care
of your parents while you can.

680
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,767
If going after your dreams
makes them happy, then…

681
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,934
Make your parents happy?

682
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,700
I love it.

683
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:23,467
Well, you enlightened me
on more than a few things today.

684
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,033
Thank you.

685
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:26,567
There, I said it.

686
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,834
I'll bet you think us Gen Zers
are snowflakes that need to be coddled.

687
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:34,633
I don't think that.

688
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:39,333
And I'll have you know,
I cannot tell a lie.

689
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,800
Well, it's home time.

690
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,767
I'll be leaving now.

691
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,433
By the way, Tokage, what was it you said?

692
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
You quit?

693
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,900
I'll see you tomorrow.

694
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,266
See you tomorrow!

695
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:20,633
Overtime again for us?

696
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Yep.

697
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:25,233
I bet you also want to just get started
on Miss Kiyokawa's new home too.

698
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:28,367
-Thank you.
-Take care.

699
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,166
Sorry I couldn't take care of you.

700
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,400
TOKAGE FAMILY GRAVE

701
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,100
But you really shouldn't
have died on me so quickly.

702
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,433
You know,

703
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,734
I never once felt like
I'd been dealt a bad hand.

704
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,200
Not when you got sick,

705
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,333
or when those debtors were out to get you.

706
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:30,333
I was always happy by your side.

707
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,333
Mom, Dad…

708
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:38,400
I thought you were amazing.

709
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,333
Well, if you're not gonna eat 'em, I will!

710
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:48,633
You don't know what you're missing!

711
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:51,033
Come on, eat up.

712
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Good, right?

713
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:59,467
Wow, yum!

714
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:09,066
"You should take care
of your parents while you can."

715
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,467
He said that?

716
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,867
Yes, and he helped out a client.

717
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:17,367
Well, he did say he wasn't doing it
to help her or anything.

718
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,400
You must be doing something right.

719
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:23,633
I don't know about that.

720
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:28,400
He's in good hands
with Tosaka Real Estate.

721
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,066
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

722
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:37,967
Yes, I'll do my best too.

723
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,900
-Tokage.
-Yeah?

724
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,367
These are the new property leaflets.

725
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:47,133
STUDIO APARTMENT
FOUR MINS FROM TACHIKAWA STATION

726
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
THIS MONTH'S SLOGAN:

727
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,467
BYE-BYE WINTER,
BUY BUY PROPERTIES!

728
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,834
What a pointless waste of paper.

729
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,700
Eventually,
it all goes onto the tablet anyway.

730
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,567
You really gotta get with the times.

731
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Paper has its advantages.

732
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:00,533
What?

733
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,633
Here.

734
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:06,867
I've realized it's easier for clients
to compare when they don't have to swipe.

735
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,467
True, but--

736
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,033
It's not pointless at all.

737
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,467
It's a great time-saver.

738
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,367
Come on, stop bothering him.

739
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:17,800
You'll waste his time.

740
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,300
Your first overtime. Right, Mr. Tokage?

741
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
It was only a little.

742
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:36,066
Nagase!

743
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,300
Miss Enomoto?

744
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,500
What's wrong?

745
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:46,100
I have a request.

746
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:48,567
Sure, anything.

747
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,333
Will you

748
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:01,000
be my fiancé?

749
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,066
NEXT EPISODE

750
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:14,333
My little girl has
finally found herself a husband in Tokyo!

751
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,633
I'll buy her a high rise!

752
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,700
So we can't do the contract
without the deposit, can we?

753
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:21,066
You should be proud to come in second.

754
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:24,934
-What's that got to do with me?
-What?

755
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,600
THE HONEST REALTOR 2
EP 6 - COMING INTO FULL BLOOM
