1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,734
So there's this dating app
I've started using.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,166
A dating app?

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,467
I signed up after a friend got me onto it

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:10,934
and I am obsessed!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,433
FIND THE ONE - DATING APP

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
That's the one where girls can use
a nickname and get to sign up for free?

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:21,166
They say PairPair has a lot of guys
who own real estate.

8
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,467
Real estate?

9
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,066
It has got guys in their 30s
with luxury apartments

10
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,600
and celebrity-types set to inherit
the family property.

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,333
-Wow! Sign me up.
-You see?

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,900
-Where is it?
-Yeah, give it a go.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,333
You go to the App Store
and download PairPair.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,900
-Yep.
-Click "Start."

15
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:41,100
FIND THE ONE - START

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,834
-Female.
-Female.

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,066
And your nickname?

18
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,000
Do people use their real info?

19
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,400
ENTER YOUR NICKNAME - YOKO

20
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,633
Who knows?

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,867
They don't?

22
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,133
I don't know. Maybe?

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,266
YOKO - NON-SMOKER

24
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,767
-What about you?
-I use my real info.

25
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,567
-Really?
-Yeah, I put my real name, Yui.

26
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,200
REGISTRATION COMPLETE

27
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,066
-It's time. Let's go.
-What?

28
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,633
But we were just getting started!

29
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,567
Come on. Before we get in trouble.

34
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,166
Mr. Tosaka!

35
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,166
We've been very active lately.

36
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,033
Kurosu is steadily pulling
new contracts on full commission.

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,367
You have a good eye!

38
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:41,467
Fujiwara's been using his connections
and continues to get great results.

39
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,400
Thank you for doing
business with me today.

40
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:47,467
Even Tokage's managed
to finalize two properties!

41
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:56,300
So Tokage was a good catalyst for helping
Nagase and Tsukishita out of their slump.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,233
Mr. Nagase?

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,367
There you are.

44
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,233
Mr. Okawa's looking for you.

45
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,066
I've gotta make a personal call.

46
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,000
Could it be--

47
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,567
A little love call to Miss Enomoto?

48
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,233
What?

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,734
Remember before?

50
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,433
Will you

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
be my fiancé?

52
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,734
Miss Enomoto professed her love for you!

53
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,233
And you've been dating ever since, right?

54
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:33,734
Not exactly.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,767
My gran from Akita is trying
to set me up with a husband.

56
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,734
She can be very pushy,
so it was an accident.

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,133
I told a little white lie
saying I'd found a potential husband.

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,667
I see.

59
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,734
She asked me what he was like,

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,233
and all I could think of
were qualities that you had!

61
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,700
-What?
-Please?

62
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:57,767
She wants you to pretend?

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,867
Her grandma's coming down from Akita
at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday.

64
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:05,800
Miss Enomoto's going to pick her up,
then wants us to all go for lunch.

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
But I've thought about it.

66
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,233
If I cannot tell a lie, how can I possibly
pretend to be her boyfriend?

67
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,333
I'm gonna refuse.

68
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,133
You can't!

69
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,700
She immediately thought of you
when asked who her boyfriend was.

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,533
That means she really must like you!

71
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,033
You'll be fine.

72
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,066
I'll go with you as back up to make sure
you don't put your foot in your mouth.

MINERVA REAL ESTATE

74
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,300
Yes, thank you.

75
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,433
In that case, I'll get the contract ready.

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,767
Yes, goodbye.

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,567
Kamiki, you sold another
studio apartment as an investment?

78
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,166
You sold the land for the shopping
district and found the perfect tenants.

79
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,900
You've got that lead position
at the new Tachikawa store in the bag!

80
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,166
Mr. Ikaruga said he'd give it to
whoever comes in first this month.

81
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,266
Hello, Mr. Watamura.

82
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:05,667
Do you think we could meet in person?

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,233
THE HONEST REALTOR 2

EP 7 OF 10
FORBIDDEN FRUIT

85
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Not her.

86
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,834
Sorry to do this last minute.
I'm suddenly not feeling too well.

87
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,200
Yoko…

88
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,166
And here I thought
we'd finally get to meet.

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,633
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,133
Are you Mr. Watamura?

91
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,500
Yes, and you are?

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm Yoko's friend.
My name is Ryoko Hanasawa.

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
-Ms. Hanasawa?
-Yes.

94
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:27,033
Yoko said she was having a first date
with a potential marriage partner,

95
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,667
and she asked me to come along
to help keep the conversation flowing.

96
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,266
Really?

97
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes.

98
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,667
It's too bad she just texted me.

99
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,233
What?

100
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,934
HIROSHI WATAMURA
SYSTEMS ENGINEER

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,867
Wow, so you work for TTN Data.

102
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,767
HIROSHI WATAMURA
TTN DATA SYSTEMS ENGINEER

103
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:48,834
Yes.

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Systems development.
So that must mean you're a programmer?

105
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,767
I'll bet you work on systems
for the government and big businesses.

106
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,834
Yeah, I guess.

107
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,700
I'm glad I met you.

108
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:01,767
What?

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,300
Yoko's always been passionate
about finding a husband.

110
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,567
I'm glad she found someone like you.

111
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,500
-You really mean that?
-Yes.

112
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:17,000
She used to always talk about
how excited she was to get married

113
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:20,000
and live in a beautiful
house with her new husband.

114
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,500
I see.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,233
I actually messaged her saying,

116
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,633
"Now that I'm in my 30s
I was thinking of buying a place,"

117
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,533
and she replied saying she liked the idea.

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,533
I totally agree.

119
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,033
I always say
that rent money is dead money.

120
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,600
I think it's great that you want to buy.

121
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,633
Yoko said the same thing!

122
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,867
I have 10 million saved up so far.

123
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
That reminds me!

124
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm actually in this line of work.

125
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,533
You're a realtor?

126
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:55,967
Just between the two of us,

127
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:01,166
there's a place nearby that Yoko said
she always wanted to live in

128
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,533
once she got married.

129
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,333
Really?

130
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Want to have a peek?

131
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,333
Yes, please!

132
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,300
Wow.

133
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:13,500
Thank you for the meal.

134
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,033
-It's fine.
-Thank you so much.

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,166
Shall I call a taxi?

136
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,000
No, we can walk there.

137
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
The high-rise building is relatively new…

138
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,233
HEAVENLY CREST YAOKI
69.8 MILLION YEN

139
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,066
…and it's priced below market value.

140
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,834
-Why's that?
-Why is it cheap?

141
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,367
Well, you see--

142
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,266
It's because people
are saying it's defective.

143
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,166
What?

144
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:54,367
It may be cheap,
but it's definitely not a bargain.

145
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,567
Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
That's our honest realtor.

147
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,266
Yeah, I know.

148
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,734
Is this the defective one?

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,767
Yeah, they say it's not even
resistant to earthquakes.

150
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,667
Thanks. Got it.

151
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,133
-Mr. Nagase.
-Yeah?

152
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,767
There's an old lady at reception.

153
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,633
An old lady? What does she want?

154
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,600
She wants to buy a high-rise
outright with cash.

155
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,900
-A high-rise?
-Yes.

156
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,000
Outright with cash?

157
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,700
-Bring her through now.
-Yes.

158
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,066
-Get the files.
-On it.

159
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,266
-Let's go.
-Okay.

160
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,233
That's right.

161
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:37,800
My little girl has finally found herself
a husband in Tokyo!

162
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,333
This will be a gift.

163
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,667
How exciting.

164
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,100
HIGH-RISE PURCHASE CONSULTATION

165
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,233
Congratulations.

166
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,400
But you see,
I'm too old to take out a loan.

167
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52,867
This is everything I've managed
to scrape up for my little girl.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,900
These are my life savings.

169
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,567
Let's have a look.

170
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,400
Thank you.

171
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,734
One zero, two zeros--

172
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,166
-200 million?
-No.

173
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,166
Calm down. It's 20 million.

174
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,000
20 million?

175
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,934
-Here. Thank you.
-Sorry.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,333
What do you think?

177
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,900
Is it enough

178
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,867
to buy a high-rise?

179
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:24,166
Inner city high-rises can go anywhere
from 50 to 200 million yen.

180
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:28,500
The more expensive ones
can even go for 5.5 billion yen.

181
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,567
I'd love to help you, but--

182
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,066
High-rises ain't no playground.

183
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,700
Only true winners in life
get to live in a high-rise in Tokyo.

184
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,800
Land in Tokyo is incredibly expensive.

185
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,834
You want to buy a high-rise as a present?

186
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,967
The day you realize that's impossible
is the day you'll get your elder wisdom!

187
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,567
Mr. Nagase, you don't
have to say it like that!

188
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,100
Why don't you give them
some financial assistance

189
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,000
when they eventually go
to buy their own property instead?

190
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,066
There are plenty of previously-owned
properties in the 20 million range.

191
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,400
Like this, for example.

192
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,734
Does it really matter
if it's not a high-rise?

193
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:14,433
Looks like I've just been a bother.

194
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,667
I hope you'll forgive me.

195
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,900
Goodbye.

196
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,000
"Goodbye"?

197
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:29,767
MORIARTY NISHI-OGIKUBO APARTMENT

198
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,500
What do you think?

199
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Well…

200
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,367
Did Yoko really say
she wanted to live here?

201
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,633
Why do you say that?

202
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,734
Well, it's just a lot more basic
than I thought it would be.

203
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:53,467
Yoko's just a really economical kinda gal!

204
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,867
I see.

205
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:58,266
How much was it going for, by the way?

206
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
50 million.

207
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,500
With a deposit of five million yen,

208
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:06,433
the remaining 45 million
can be paid off on a 35-year loan,

209
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,800
leaving you with a monthly repayment
of 110,000 yen.

210
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,900
Wow, that's cheaper
than what I'm paying now in rent.

211
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,600
You see? Economical.

212
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,734
Would you consider buying it?

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,600
You could buy it
as a surprise gift for Yoko!

214
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,867
I'm sure she'd be delighted.

215
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:30,967
That's a good idea!

216
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,533
Can I take some photos?

217
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,900
Of course!

218
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:49,233
THE NEXT DAY

219
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,767
Here's the contract.

220
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,200
PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
OF REAL ESTATE

221
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:58,867
There's just one thing.

222
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:00,834
Yes?

223
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:03,900
I…

224
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,033
Actually, I can't get
the five million for the deposit.

225
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,767
Sorry?

226
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:17,500
So we can't do the contract
without the deposit, can we?

227
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,934
I guess not…

228
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,667
TOSAKA REAL ESTATE

230
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,467
PROPERTY PURCHASE CONSULTATION

231
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,667
Please wait here.

232
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,734
-It's being used as a study.
-I see.

233
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,433
Is that someone who wants
to buy a property?

234
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,233
Yeah, a previously-owned condo
near Kokubunji.

235
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,567
That sounds great!

236
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:55,900
It's not.

237
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,000
He wants us to foot the deposit

238
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,934
and says he'll pay us back later.

239
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,734
That would be inducement, right?

240
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
Exactly.

241
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,600
What's inducement?

242
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's break it down.

243
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,000
If a realtor tells someone they'll
lend them the money for a deposit,

244
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:18,100
telling them they can pay it back later
or in installments,

245
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,967
the realtor is rushing the sale
and inducing the client into a contract.

246
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,900
This is a violation of real estate law.

247
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:27,567
The penalty is a maximum
six months in prison,

248
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,734
a fine of up to one million yen,

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,567
or even both.

250
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,166
Your business will be suspended,

251
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:38,600
and you may even be penalized
by losing your realtor's license.

252
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,166
Oh no!

253
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:46,367
And so, realtors should
steer clear of inducement.

254
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,900
Don't do it!

255
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,834
Ms. Hanasawa.

256
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,967
You're certainly working hard.

257
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,367
But don't work too hard.

258
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,633
You should be proud to come in second.

259
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,100
After all, coming in second means
you're top of the losers.

260
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,734
Mr. Ikaruga, I'd like your advice.

261
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,066
It's a personal request.

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,900
TTN DATA - TOKYO HEADQUARTERS

263
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:46,734
Mr. Watamura, I managed to find
the five million for you.

264
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,300
You did?

265
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,767
You can pay me back later.

266
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,600
Thank you so much! You're a big help.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,767
But keep this to yourself.

268
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,834
And I'll keep it a secret from Yoko.

269
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,166
Of course.

270
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:16,166
I'm afraid Tosaka Real Estate is unable
to pay the deposit on your behalf.

271
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:18,633
Come on. Help a man out here.

272
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,967
We finally found the perfect place.

273

AKIHIRO DOI
47 YO - RESTAURATEUR

274
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,633
You got quotas, right?

275
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,867
I'll bet they're hard to fill.

276
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,433
It's not a bad deal for you.

277
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,667
I'm afraid it's illegal, so…

278
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,700
Listen here, Mr. Banknote.

279
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,667
Yes, our clients' faces totally look
like the guy on the 10,000-yen note.

280
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,734
FUKUZAWA YUKICHI

281
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Yukichi!

282
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:49,033
I am practically
champing at the bit to help you.

283
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,333
However…

284
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,166
I want to do my job
with my head held high.

285
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,166
Do you know why inducement
is against the law?

286
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,066
Inducement?

287
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,667
Buying a property is one of the biggest
decisions most people will ever make,

288
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:16,533
and us realtors take a small brokerage fee
once the contract has been concluded.

289
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah?

290
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:23,233
But some realtors get greedy and try to
push sales onto clients who aren't ready.

291
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,100
What do you think happens if they
foot the deposit and rush to a sale?

292
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,834
If you rush this decision
to buy your forever home,

293
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:34,767
won't you regret it later?

294
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,900
I want my clients to be absolutely
happy with their purchase.

295
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
So even if it were legal,

296
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:46,333
I would never induce
my clients into contract.

297
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:54,734
Sorry you had to call.

298
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Ms. Hanasawa.

299
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:01,900
He got into a fight with his friend
and he fell over after being pushed.

300
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,734
Hokuto wasn't doing anything wrong.

301
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,133
MIREI FUJIMORI
CHILDCARE WORKER

302
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,600
The rule is everyone has to share
the scooter and we get five minutes each,

303
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,500
and one of the kids wouldn't share.

304
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,633
Hokuto was very brave
and spoke up to the child.

305
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,033
That's when it turned into an argument.

306
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,633
Mama.

307
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,433
I was right, wasn't I?

308
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,300
You have to follow the rules.

309
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,900
That's what you always say.

310

NEW FIXED INTEREST RATE

Tomorrow's the big day, right?

312
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,333
When Mr. Nagase
gets to meet the grandparents.

313
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
It's not that formal.

314
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,767
He's only pretending to be my boyfriend.

315
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Isn't this just the next step
to actually dating?

316
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,834
Absolutely no way!

317
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:02,533
No way. Not at all.

318
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,633
No way. Way?

319
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,467
No way. Way? Way?

320
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:07,734
Way means way.

321
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Way?

322
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,767
Open up.

323
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,467
Hello, ma'am.

324
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm from Tosaka Real Estate.

325
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I see.

326
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,900
Sorry about the other day.

327
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,166
Sorry we couldn't help you
with the high-rise.

328
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,433
It's quite all right.

329
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,633
Would you like to have a bite?

330
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,934
-Thank you.
-Go on.

331
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,233
That's so good!

332
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,834
-Right?
-Yes.

333
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,367
I'm hungry. How about you?

334
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm not.

335
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,567
-That's so good!
-Sure is.

336
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,433
Miss Tsukishita!

337
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,467
Hokuto! Did you just finish preschool?

338
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,533
Yeah.

339
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,533
Ms. Hanasawa.

340
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,800
Mama!

341
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
I see you.

342
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:33,967
Ms. Hanasawa and I are fated rivals.

343
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,834
-You are?
-Right, Ms. Hanasawa?

344
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
We're just in the same industry.

345
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,767
So you're a realtor too?

346
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,467
Yes, that's right.

347
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:51,934
My name is Ryoko Hanasawa.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you.

349
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,300
She's got a sharp tongue, goes against
the grain, and is completely overbearing.

350
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,367
Now look here--

351
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:03,033
But she always has the customer's
best interests at heart.

352
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,233
You can trust Ms. Hanasawa.

353
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,934
What's this all of a sudden?
You'll make me blush.

354
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,600
What a great time to be alive.

355
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,333
Two women, marching out into the world,

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,467
doing a bang-up job.

357
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,967
What a wonderful thing!

358
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:40,667
You must have worked real hard
to get where you are today.

359
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,900
Your face says it all.

360
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:50,633
Well…

361
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,667
I…

362
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,834
If I ever become the boss,

363
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,400
I want to set up a day-care center
in the workplace.

364
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,867
Day-care center?

365
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,667
I want to set aside a kids' room

366
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:27,633
and I want changing tables
in all the men's bathrooms.

367
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,166
So men can take care
of their children while they're at work?

368
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,467
I'll offer both maternity
and paternity leave.

369
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,100
I want to create a workplace
that's comfortable for everyone.

370
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,033
That sounds amazing!

371
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:48,266
I had no idea you had
such lofty ambitions.

372
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,900
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

373
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,734
I want to help you.

374
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,100
Go for it!

375
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:03,033
I think I just gained
two more granddaughters!

376
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:07,100
Grandma's got your back.

377
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,567
HELPING YOU FIND A HOME

378
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,000
Today's the big day, Mr. Nagase.

379
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:19,934
What?

380
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,233
Don't tell me you've forgotten
about your big day?

381
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,266
You're meeting up with Miss Enomoto
and her grandmother at 1:00.

382
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,767
That's right. Man, I so don't wanna go.

383
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,266
Pull yourself together, man!

384
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,567
Mr. Nagase.

385
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,133
That Mr. Doi from yesterday
is here to see you again.

386
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,700
What? Seriously?

387
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:44,834
The deposit.

388
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,033
I got it for you.

389
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,567
I cooled down after our meeting,

390
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,767
and I thought long and hard about whether
I really needed this place.

391
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,233
And I realized

392
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,700
I absolutely must have it.

393
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
My family will be happy here

394
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,266
and it'll be good for my work.

395
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,266
So I sold the motorbike.

396
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,333
I said to the wife I'm happy
to have less spending money,

397
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,734
and even her parents couldn't help
but to help us out.

398
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:26,433
So that's how you got the money.

399
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,900
I'd kind of assumed something else.

400
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,033
What did you assume?

401
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,767
-No--
-Like you broke thumbs to get it.

402
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,767
-What?
-No! I didn't mean that!

403
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,300
-That's not it.
-Look at him.

404
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,633
-I didn't--
-In any case,

405
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,467
let's proceed with the purchase.

406
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,533
-Yes.
-Sure.

407
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,900
WE'LL HELP YOU FIND
THE PERFECT HIGH-RISE - MINERVA

408
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:50,800
We'll be in touch with you again.

409
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
-Yes, please.
-Goodbye.

410
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,900
Excuse me?

411
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,266
Is Ms. Hanasawa around?

412
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:02,000
Ms. Hanasawa? She's out at the moment.

413
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,934
I see. I'll come back later.

414
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:07,633
Goodbye.

415
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,300
I can help if you like, ma'am.

416
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,433
No thank you, dear--

417
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Higashino.

418
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,934
What happened?
Why did you withdraw from our contract?

419
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,700
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,533
My job got reassigned out of the blue.

421
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
They suddenly want me in Kansai.

422
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,900
I can't very well be setting up my life
in Tokyo now, can I?

423
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,967
There's no point in complaining about it.

424
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,533
And Yoko's been ghosting me lately.

425
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,900
We still haven't even met in person.

426
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:50,233
I'm beginning to wonder if maybe
I was just coming on too strong.

427
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,133
Sorry.

428
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,233
I know you tried to help.

429
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:00,133
Wait.

430
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,100
I'm actually considering buying a
studio apartment for investment purposes.

431
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,734
That way I can transfer for work--

432
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,633
Are you sure?

433
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,867
If you cancel now,
it'll be at the buyer's discretion

434
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:12,100
and you may not get your deposit back.

435
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,934
You mean the deposit
your company paid for?

436
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes!

437
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:20,233
What's that got to do with me?

438
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:22,367
What?

439
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,433
You paying for my deposit was
an inducement to enter into a contract.

440
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,934
It's a violation of real estate law.

441
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,133
The guy who recommended
I get a studio apartment said so.

442
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,066
I am under no obligation
to pay back that deposit.

443
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,934
If you try to say otherwise,

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,367
I'll raise it with
the Office for Housing Policy.

445
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:45,867
Minerva Real Estate will get a suspension.

446
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,967
Apparently, you could even lose
your realtor's license.

447
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:02,000
That five million we paid for Mr. Watamura
has already gone to the seller.

448
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,166
Thank you.

449
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:13,500
Kamiki, I made the reservation.

450
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Thank you.

451
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,767
He's a big player at a large IT firm.

452
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:19,867
I want this to be perfect.

453
00:26:19,934 --> 00:26:21,200
Yes, sir.

454
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,800
Is it another contract?

455
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:27,867
No, he helped me transfer
a thorn in my side to Kansai.

456
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:32,100
That guy you sold
an Osakan investment property to?

457
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,100
Watamura, right?
That bumbling paper pusher?

458
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:39,767
That's the one.

459
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,967
So it was you pulling the strings.

460
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,367
You told him to cancel my contract

461
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,667
so you could push
your own property on him.

462
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,300
How could you stoop so low?

463
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:08,734
I told you to be proud of being second.

464
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,600
Mr. Nagase, your tie is crooked.

465
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:35,800
-Thanks.
-There you go.

466
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,667
Aren't you being a little too nervous?

467
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,200
You'll be fine.

468
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
-Nagase!
-Miss Enomoto?

469
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,567
What's wrong? I thought you'd be
at Tokyo Station--

470
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:48,767
I just got a call from Gran saying
she can't make it to the station!

471
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,166
-What?
-Why?

472
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:54,333
It seems she's been staying with relatives
for the past two days.

473
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,300
She said she'd call later today after
her errands but now she's not picking up!

474
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,033
It's okay. Calm down.

475
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,934
Let's just find the store
she might have stopped in at.

476
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,633
-Okay.
-Do you have a photo?

477
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Yes.

478
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,066
Here.

479
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,066
Is it enough

480
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,700
to buy a high-rise?

481
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,400
No way.

482
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:18,467
Wait.

483
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,400
She came to see us just the other day.

484
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,467
What?

485
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:25,367
She wanted to buy a high-rise
as a present for her granddaughter.

486
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,900
So that was you!

487
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,734
That reminds me.

488
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,900
Gran used to always say
when I was a little girl…

489
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,233
When you get married, Minami,

490
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,834
Gran's gonna help
you and your future husband.

491
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:45,200
She's gonna buy you
your very own house to live in.

492
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,266
Thanks!

493
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,467
So,

494
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,066
does that mean your future husband…

495
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:02,667
Well, I'll be darned!

496
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:04,800
What do you think, Mrs. Enomoto?

497
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,100
How's the window view

498
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,834
in the luxurious high-rise
that is Heavenly Crest Yaoki?

499
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,800
Window view?

500
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:14,633
My apologies.

501
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:22,567
My stars!

502
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:25,767
You really can see everything!

503
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,900
Feels like I'm in a Ferris wheel!

504
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,233
That's the feeling one can only get
from living in a high-rise.

505
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:38,166
A place like this

506
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,333
would make my granddaughter
and her future husband so happy!

507
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,033
You're absolutely right!

508
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,734
Want to purchase?

509
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,633
That old lady from Akita
really likes her high-rises.

510
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,667
Doesn't look like she's made of money.

511
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,633
I had no idea at first as to why Kamiki
was so adamant about pursuing her.

512
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,166
Please prepare a meeting room.

513
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,900
I took a look at her assets,

514
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,166
and guess how much
her land in Akita is worth?

515
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,533
Still,

516
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:14,367
I'll bet it costs around 5.5 billion.

517
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,533
It's not that much.

518
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,867
It's 80 million.

519
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,066
HEAVENLY CREST YAOKI
80 MILLION YEN

520
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:25,600
No, it's not for me.

521
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:28,867
I only have 20 million.

522
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:30,400
Don't worry.

523
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:35,133
I know there are plans to develop
a large-scale project

524
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,567
near your current residence
in Utsumi Town in Akita.

525
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,200
Have you ever received any queries

526
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:44,767
about selling your house
and your farmland?

527
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,367
I have.

528
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,266
By my estimates,

529
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,667
you'd get at least
60 million yen for the land.

530
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:53,066
Combine that with your 20 million…

531
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,600
TOTAL 80 MILLION YEN

532
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,600
…and you can buy the high-rise.

533
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:01,467
I suppose I could sell my land in Akita.

534
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,567
Mr. Nagase!

535
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,734
I got us a taxi.

536
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Okay.

537
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:17,166
Let's visit all the real estate agencies
she could have gone to.

538
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,700
MS. HANASAWA
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

539
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
-Mrs. Enomoto.
-Gran!

540
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,633
Wait. What are you doing?

541
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,066
We'll call the police.

542
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,166
This way.

543
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,633
She's from Akita, and she's
looking to purchase a high-rise.

544
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,200
I thought it might be her.

545
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,133
-Right.
-Gran!

546
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,300
Gran!

547
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,900
Minami?

548
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,667
Kamiki?

549
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,367
Thank you for before.

550
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,734
Mr. Kamiki, are you trying
to trick Mrs. Enomoto now?

551
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,633
How very rude of you.

552
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:03,300
I'm merely assisting Mrs. Enomoto
to purchase a high-rise

553
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,900
for her beloved granddaughter.

554
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,834
Minami.

555
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,967
Remember the promise I made
when you were a little one?

556
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:16,066
When my beautiful
little Minami becomes a bride,

557
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,834
Grandma's dream is to buy you
your own house to live in!

558
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,500
It is nothing short of enviable.

559
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:29,333
We at Minerva are always happy to help
our clients find happiness in their homes.

560
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,266
That's rich.

561
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:35,533
Mrs. Enomoto, I know you want to
take care of your granddaughter.

562
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,300
I'm sure her future husband would also--

563
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:45,667
No, I don't know about him, but have
you ever heard of an "unsolicited favor"?

564
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,600
Did you even ask what she wants?

565
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:53,166
Does she even want a high-rise?

566
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,233
What's most important in real estate

567
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,734
are the dreams and the life plans
of the people who will live there.

568
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,367
Marvelous.

569
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,633
Dreams. Life plans.

570
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,133
Little buzzwords used
to sell your dream home.

571
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:37,500
But dreams, plans, and even happiness

572
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:41,266
can all go up in flames in an instant.

573
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,533
So when you finally get ahold of them,

574
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,100
you must never let them go.

575
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,266
The time to buy

576
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,633
is the moment you feel that desire to buy.

577
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,800
It's not a realtor's job
to push the client into a sale.

578
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,734
Gran.

579
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:08,266
I don't need no high-rise.

580
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:14,834
And I definitely don't want you
to sell your home in Akita.

581
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:17,767
What?

582
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:22,767
That place is full of memories
we have together.

583
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:27,600
I absolutely treasure that place.

584
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:34,266
Just knowing that you're living your days
in happiness and in good health

585
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:38,300
would be the biggest present
of all for Minami.

586
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,600
Your old Gran can be a bit rash sometimes.

587
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,967
I should have asked what you wanted.

588
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,133
Gran just got ahead of herself

589
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,000
and started doing her own thing.

590
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,667
Sorry, darling.

591
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:05,266
It's okay.

592
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:09,967
I'm happy just knowing that you love me.

593
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,166
Mr. Kamiki.

594
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,300
Sorry to trouble you.

595
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:27,467
Let's just forget
about buying the high-rise.

596
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm afraid it's too late.

597
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,200
For you see, Mrs. Enomoto
has already signed the contract.

598
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,600
SANAE ENOMOTO

599
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:48,567
If you renege on the contract now,

600
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:52,200
it will be at the buyer's discretion,

601
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,066
and that eight-million-yen deposit
will be forfeit.

602
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:59,934
I won't get my money back?

603
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:05,033
Well, shall I just buy it then?

604
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Oh, no…

605
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,533
Kamiki.

606
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,567
The property you've foisted
upon Mrs. Enomoto

607
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,700
is Heavenly Crest Yaoki, right?

608
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:29,533
People are claiming that one is defective.

609
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,266
Is this the defective one?

610
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,400
Yeah, they say it's not even
resistant to earthquakes.

611
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,800
Mrs. Enomoto.

612
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,900
There are complaints that this property
is not earthquake resistant.

613
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,667
Was this explained to you
before you signed the contract?

614
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:04,200
I knew I had a keen eye
when it comes to men.

615
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,667
I am a realtor.

616
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,667
I won't allow real estate to be a source
of unhappiness to those I care about.

617
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:28,467
Kamiki.

618
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,300
You knew this high-rise
had a declining worth.

619
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,967
You knew it was defective
and yet you pushed it on an elderly woman.

620
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,767
This is clearly a breach
of your duty to disclose.

621
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,533
BREACH OF DUTY TO DISCLOSE

622
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,266
Which means this contract
is null and void, correct?

623
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,233
Mrs. Enomoto.

624
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:03,333
I will make the appropriate arrangements
to cancel your contract for you.

625
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,233
Yes, please.

626
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:09,266
Higashino, do we have any more
of those sweets from that store?

627
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:11,767
What?

628
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Yes.

629
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:17,633
They're very good red bean mochi cakes.

630
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
I see.

631
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,166
Would you like another cup of tea?

632
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:22,867
Yes, please.

633
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,567
Tea readers would say
this pattern is lucky.

634
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,967
I'm sorry.

635
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:37,500
My contract with Hiroshi Watamura
ended up being canceled.

636
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,633
The five-million deposit
you paid is now forfeit.

637
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:45,533
I will pay you back.

638
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:50,834
Don't bother.

639
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,166
You can earn it back.

640
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:03,734
You're a realtor.

641
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
First place is mine.

642
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,133
That's what I swore.

643
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Here you go!

644
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,567
Rice balls made with rice
grown in Akita Prefecture.

645
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:55,333
Looks great! Thank you so much.

646
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,667
We'll be bringing more food out.

647
00:39:57,734 --> 00:39:59,533
-Yes.
-Okay, thank you.

648
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,834
You're really big on family,
aren't you, Minami?

649
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm glad I got to catch a glimpse
of such a rare and different side of you.

650
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,767
-I was moved too.
-What?

651
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:16,200
I never knew you felt
so strongly about me.

652
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Do I?

653
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,734
You said you wouldn't let me be unhappy.

654
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,000
I won't allow real estate to be a source
of unhappiness to those I care about.

655
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,233
I did.

656
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,567
Mr. Nagase.

657
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,900
You're her fiancé, right?

658
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,700
That's--

659
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,300
Actually--

660
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:50,867
That's right! They're absolutely
smitten with each other.

661
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:52,934
They're always coming here together.

662
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,700
Anyone with eyes can see
they're two peas in a pod.

663
00:40:55,767 --> 00:41:01,667
And what do you like most
about my dear Minami?

664
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:06,400
What do I like about her?

665
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,867
Well, she's got great taste--

666
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:10,934
SHOJIKIMON

667
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:14,467
She's beautiful. She's kind.

668
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:18,433
She's very stylish.

669
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:27,367
It's her meat and potato stew!

670
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,300
Meat and potato stew?

671
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,767
She's a mean drunk
and gets mad super easily.

672
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,100
She slaps me across the face and she
rebukes any offer of physical touch!

673
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,900
But I love her food,
and her stew is sublime!

674
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,433
And she's got a great bod, yeah!

675
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,867
That's what I like about her!

676
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,567
Did I take it too far?

677
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:45,100
Mr. Nagase! How could you say that?
Of course it's too far!

678
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,200
You're the absolute worst.

679
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:50,934
You sick, shameless pig!

680
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,533
-No, stop! Watch out!
-Just let it go!

681
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,433
-Minami!
-Wait--

682
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,767
Minami!

683
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:02,700
Your Gran's hunch is never wrong.

684
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,367
I can tell

685
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:11,300
that Mr. Nagase
is obviously your soulmate.

686
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,033
What?

687
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
Your grandpa

688
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:19,233
used to love my meat and potato stew.

689
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,467
He adored it.

690
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,700
He loved it so much,

691
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:32,800
I couldn't help but fall for him.

692
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:34,967
How lovely.

693
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Gran.

694
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,834
Mr. Nagase.

695
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,133
Thank you.

696
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:52,900
Please…

697
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:56,300
take care

698
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:01,900
of my dear little Minami.

699
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:29,934
Who could that be
this early in the morning?

700
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,934
I'm here!

701
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:44,734
What?

702
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:50,166
I'll be living here from now on.

703
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,200
What?

704
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:56,500
You've been short-listed.

705
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,100
What?

706
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,200
NEXT EPISODE

707
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:13,600
I recommend Mr. Nagase,
a realtor from Tosaka Real Estate.

708
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,500
He's famous for being brutally honest.

709
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:19,500
They say Mr. Nagase from
Tosaka Real Estate is honest and reliable.

710
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,834
Full commission means
my job's always on the line.

711
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,100
Mr. Kurosu!

712
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:24,934
What's this?

713
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,600
