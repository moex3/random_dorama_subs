00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,667
-More please.
-Of course.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,633
Man, I can't get enough of your cooking.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,667
Once I start, I just can't stop.

5
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,066
Makes me feel energized
for the following day.

6
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,000
Or like the high-rise I gave up on
wasn't just a dream.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,900
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

8
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:27,734
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,633
And remember to clean up afterwards.

I've already placed my dishes in the sink.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so…

14
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,934
I bid you good night.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Good night.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,633
That is good.

-Morning.
-Good morning.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,066
Mr. Nagase.

20
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,033
-Good morning.
-Hey.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,800
Good morning.

22
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,300
Isn't it lovely?

23
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:10,333
Store owners and volunteers
working together to clean up the town.

24
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:12,633
What a great morning.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,433
Mr. Nagase.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,133
-Thanks for your help before.
-No problem.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,700
You really helped me out
with the rent on my store.

28
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,900
I'm a realtor. Happy to help in any way.

29
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,767
-Micchan, come here.
-Good morning.

30
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,300
Micchan also needs some helping out.

31
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,400
-Won't you help her?
-What's wrong?

32
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:32,467
Management has given me a warning
about the common area in my building.

33
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,066
I'm good at handling that sort of thing.

34
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:37,066
-I'll leave it to you.
-Leave it to me.

35
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:42,133
I really don't have time
to be putting out fires right now.

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,633
I've gotta get more contracts
and make my comeback as number one.

37
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,633
Nagase.

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,033
I see you putting in
the late hours lately.

39
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,533
Thank you.

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,433
So don't worry if you end up losing
to Fujiwara in that race to get promoted.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,800
I haven't lost yet.

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,166
I'm going out to speak with
another landlord friend of mine.

43
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:07,667
Hello. Kurosu here.

44
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,967
Yes, I've been waiting for your call.

45
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,200
Thank you.

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
-Yes.
-Haven't you?

47
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,066
You have a good eye!

48
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,333
So what
if you don't get to become manager?

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,467
What?

50
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,500
Everyone loves you
down at the commercial district.

51
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,667
I envy you and your sales.

52
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,066
Though it's not translating to results.

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,800
So what?

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Yes.

55
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm sure I mentioned that
when going over the disclosure statement.

56
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,533
You remember, right? Of course you do.

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,467
You know
I can't do anything about that now.

58
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,233
-Kurosu got another complaint?
-Yes.

59
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,800
He's getting a lot of them lately.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,400
Of course he is.

61
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,467
He's too pushy.

62
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,867
He's the one guy I need to beat.

63
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:53,133
Yes, I do apologize.

64
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,600
Is everything all right?

65
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,166
They're just having a grumble.

66
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,667
Can't let a little thing like this
get to me.

67
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,066
No, I mean,

68
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,000
you've been looking a bit pale recently.

69
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,967
How can you tell under all that tan?

70
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,633
It's like there's a glow to your skin,
but it's too bright.

71
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:21,166
Maybe I should win a big contract and head
on over to the Ivory Coast to fix it.

72
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,433
Just go to a regular tanning salon.

73
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
LAVATORY

74
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,834
Shit.

STOMACH MEDICINE
FOR TUMMY STRESS

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,767
Damn it.

77
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,867
I can't believe that
Mr. Popular is gaining on me.

78
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:06,367
On full commission,
my sole existence is to make sales.

79
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,200
FULL COMMISSION (NO BASE SALARY)

80
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,734
If I'm not on top, I don't belong here.

81

TOSAKA REAL ESTATE
NO.1 IN THE AREA

82
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,533
Excuse me, we have a new client.

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,033
-I'll take it.
-No.

84
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,867
He's asking for Mr. Nagase.

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,834
Asking?

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Yes.

87
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:30,600
He has a good eye!

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Excuse us.

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Hello.

90
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm Saichi Nagase, as requested.

91
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,433
Hello, I'm Sakura Tsukishita.

92
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm Kento Tokage.

93
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,667
Hello.

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
May I ask how it is you know me?

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,767
A man at Minerva Real Estate
told me about you. Mr. Kamiki.

96
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,567
Mr. Kamiki?

97
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,100
This has to be a trap.

98
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:08,000
Definitely a trap.

99
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,700
THE HONEST REALTOR 2

100
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,667
EP 8 OF 10
PERPETUAL CYCLE OF HELL

101
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:25,633
I got a call asking if I'd
like to invest in a studio apartment.

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,166
I've been in conversation
with Minerva Real Estate so far.

103
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,000
STUDIO INVESTMENT
PURCHASE CONSULTATION

104
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:34,166
There's been a lot of cold calls
for studio investments lately.

105
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,800
They say you can get started
with very little money down.

106
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,033
Studio apartments are certainly
more affordable than detached houses

107
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,033
in terms of investment properties.

108
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,567
Yes, and I know investing isn't easy.

109
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:48,467
FUMIHIKO SHINOZAKI - EMPLOYEE
AT A DISTRIBUTIONS COMPANY

110
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,500
Three years ago,

111
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,000
I actually bought a new studio investment
in Nishi-Kokubunji.

112
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,834
FIRST PROPERTY - PURCHASED
NEW APARTMENT IN NISHI-KOKUBUNJI

113
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,867
-Is that so?
-Yes.

114
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:59,900
They said I could sublease
to get a guaranteed rental income.

115
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:01,700
SUBLEASE AGENCY
GUARANTEES RENT AS TENANT

116
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:02,633
AND SUBLETS TO ANOTHER

117
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,500
It was through a company
called TBG Corporation,

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,900
but they went bankrupt two years ago.

119
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,934
It was a big deal.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,467
Now I have no tenant…

121
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,533
A FEW HOURS EARLIER

122
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

123
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:17,700
…and I've been in the red for more
than a year with no rental income.

124
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:22,333
Mr. Shinozaki, I think you should sell
that property right away.

125
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,133
While you may have bought it new,

126
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,333
in the past three years,
it will have dropped in value by 70%.

127
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,066
Seventy percent?

128
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,967
You may have lost in one investment

129
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,266
but you can make it back in another.

130
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,633
He suggested I get another investment,

131
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,600
and he's recommending this one.

132
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:47,567
Jewel Yaoki?

133
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,533
GREAT INVESTMENT
24-HOUR SECURITY - 18 MILLION

134
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
20 years old and 20 square meters.

135
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,767
Ten minutes on foot from Yaoki Station…

136
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,633
SECOND STUDIO PROPERTY
PREVIOUSLY OWNED THROUGH KAMIKI

137
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
…and 18 million yen.

138
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,667
Is it too expensive for you?

139
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,767
I've already had one failed investment
and I don't want to put my family out.

140
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm thinking I have to be careful.

141
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,066
For this property…

142
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,867
JEWEL YAOKI - 18 MILLION YEN
2.3% PER ANNUM

143
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,000
…you could take out
a 30-year loan at 2.3% per annum

144
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,166
with a repayment of 70,000 yen per month.

145
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:20,367
If you were to rent it out
for 100,000 yen a month,

146
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,934
that's a 30,000-yen profit right there.

147
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,767
And when you've paid off the loan,

148
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,633
the entire 100,000 yen in rental payments
will be yours.

149
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,233
PROFIT - 100,000 YEN

150
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,033
If you're still having second thoughts,

151
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,767
why not get a second opinion
from another real estate agency?

152
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,333
What?

153
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:47,734
I recommend Mr. Nagase,
a realtor from Tosaka Real Estate.

154
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,934
He's famous for being brutally honest.

155
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,767
He said that?

156
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,633
JEWEL YAOKI

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,000
JEWEL YAOKI - PREVIOUSLY-OWNED
STUDIO APARTMENT

158
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,166
It's an older building.

159
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:16,867
Considering the low price
keeps your up-front costs low,

160
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,900
it certainly looks to be more suited
for investment purposes.

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,600
So you think I should buy it?

162
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:25,200
No. The exact opposite.

163
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,233
What?

164
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,600
It's too much.

165
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,867
I'd say it's worth around 15 million.

166
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,200
And I think it'd bring in 80,000 a month.

167
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:38,266
So he was trying
to pull the wool over my eyes?

168
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,166
Yes.

169
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,600
KAMIKI'S EVALUATION 18 MILLION
YEN - 100,000 YEN/MONTH IN RENT

170
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,000
Even if you got it down
to a reasonable price,

171
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,900
it's hard to tell
whether you'd still be in the red or not.

172
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,700
Nagase, no investment property
can withstand that evaluation.

173
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,600
I mean, I wouldn't mind buying myself
if the price was right.

174
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,867
Are you interested in investing?

175
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,433
Passive income is a great use of time.

176
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,133
Yes, investing in studio apartments

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,367
is an easy way to live the dream
of living on passive income.

178
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,033
As a realtor, I do recommend--

179
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,967
Except,

180
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,767
in reality,
that dream is always a hideous nightmare.

181
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:18,934
What?

182
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,967
Investment properties aren't something
for any old fop to dip his toes into.

183
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,734
In reality, there are property taxes
and management costs.

184
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,467
All those monthly expenses
are sure to send anyone in the red.

185
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,333
FOR SURE IN THE RED - PROPERTY
TAXES AND MANAGEMENT FEES

186
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,200
If you want to be in the black,

187
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:39,967
you need to constantly be on top
of market prices and interest rates.

188
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,834
Sure, you might dip into the red,

189
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,967
but it's an asset
once the loan's paid off.

190
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,567
It can help support retirement.

191
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,967
Mr. Shinozaki.

192
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:52,500
Can you say for sure that this property
won't decline in value in 30 years' time?

193
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:57,800
Mr. Kamiki said the data suggests
it could go over 18 million.

194
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,500
You can't just accept him on face value.

195
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:05,867
Numbers never lie,
but you can exploit the way they're used.

196
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,066
Listen.

197
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,200
The real estate industry
has its share of predatory hyenas

198
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:14,767
who prey on ignorant civilians
such as yourself.

199
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:19,000
Every few years, an acquisition agent
comes to buy your property on the cheap,

200
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:22,800
then someone else comes
to sell you another investment property.

201
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,867
It's like a never-ending,
perpetual cycle of hell!

202
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,066
You're better off
kissing that dream goodbye!

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,367
Just what could Kamiki be planning
with all this?

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

205
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,233
Mr. Tanaka was coming in
at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

206
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,667
He's just called asking
to adjust it by one hour.

207
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,233
I was wondering when you'd show up.

208
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,467
Nagase.

209
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:00,633
What's this about Mr. Shinozaki
and his studio investment?

210
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,800
I'm in the mood for a little bet.

211
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
A bet?

212
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,700
If I can get Mr. Shinozaki to purchase
an inflated studio apartment, I win.

213
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,900
If he doesn't buy, you win.

214
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
What do you think?

215
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,333
I think I'm a lucky man.

216
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,734
I managed to convince Mr. Shinozaki.

217
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,800
I told him to sell his property in the red
and to just cut his losses.

218
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,633
You really are too soft.

219
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,500
If I were you,

220
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,633
I would have shown him
another property and got him to sign.

221
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,967
But I know you can't do that,
so here's a little heads-up.

222
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,300
I am number one in this industry.

223
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,033
Now it's my turn.

224
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,400
I have another little bet prepared.

225
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:01,533
This one won't be
as easy as Mr. Shinozaki.

226
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,567
Another one?

227
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,700
-Hello.
-Welcome back.

228
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,033
Has anyone asked for me?

229
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,300
Yes, they were looking
for an investment property.

230
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,934
Mr. Kurosu said he'd take it.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,033
-Kurosu?
-Yes.

232
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,533
CRADLE OGIKUBO
MONTHLY INCOME OF 90,000 YEN

233
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,834
Make no mistake.

234
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,667
While it may be 20 million yen,

235
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:26,734
mine is a much better bargain
than that inflated Minerva property.

236
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
KEITO UNNO
ELECTRICS FACTORY WORKER

237
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,500
How much would the deposit be?

238
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,100
It's 10% on a property like this,
so two million.

239
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,500
Doesn't that make it pretty much the same
as Minerva's so-called inflated property?

240
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,633
I'm already saddled with
a studio apartment that's in the red.

241
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,867
I've told you this.

242
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:57,266
I need to keep my up-front costs low.

243
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,066
UP-FRONT COSTS
DEPOSIT, STAMP DUTY, ETC.

244
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:04,934
Mr. Nagase is meant to be up-front.
I should have gone with him.

245
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,100
I can still help you.

246
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,133
Kurosu, what did you do?

247
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,433
What's it to you?

248
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,467
That's no ordinary client you picked up.

249
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,967
He was sent by Kamiki from Minerva
specifically to spite me.

250
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,900
To spite you?

251
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,967
Kamiki's done something,

252
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:29,867
and we need to stop that client
from purchasing that property.

253
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,700
Then you can rest assured.

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,967
I'm such a great salesman

255
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,433
that I found him another
more suitable property.

256
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,433
-You what?
-So he's my client now.

257
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,200
Not yours, or Minerva's.

258
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,333
I hope you didn't do anything underhanded.

259
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,700
Don't worry.

260
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
And quit butting in.

261
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,066
Kamiki.

262
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:01,400
Looks like you're doing well
selling all these studio investments.

263
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:04,100
Yes, it is very fortunate.

264
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:09,100
Now we have all the funding we need.

265
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,300
-Makes the next step even easier.
-Yes.

266
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,000
Now it's just Tosaka Real Estate
blocking my view.

267
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,200
I've already thrown them off balance.

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,200
It's time to take their greatest salesman
down a notch.

269
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,834
You're really something, Kamiki.

270
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,700
How are you banging out
one studio investment after another?

271
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,633
With this. It's a client list.

272
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,000
From TBG Corporation.

273
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,266
TBG CORPORATION CLIENT LIST

274
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,033
-TBG?
-You've never heard of them?

275
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,867
They went bankrupt after going into
administration two years ago.

276
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,000
They specialized in studio apartments.

277
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,500
Why did they go under?

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,967
They used all manner of sales techniques,
including intimidation and extortion.

279
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:58,500
At worst, they even forced people to buy
at more than three times the market price.

280
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,500
And to ensure no one ever found out,

281
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,734
they only targeted the vulnerable.

282
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,166
Once a fool, always a fool.

283
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,166
Where did you even get such a thing?

284
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,967
From Mr. Ikaruga, the grandfather
of TBG Corporation's high-handed methods.

285
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,767
I bought it off him for ten million.

286
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,266
Would you like to buy it?

287
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,633
I could sell it for nine million.

288
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,266
But only if you'll use it well.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Yes, thank you.

290
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,166
Goodbye.

291
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,767
Who was that?

292
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,133
The realtor.

293
00:15:58,633 --> 00:15:59,767
Which one?

294
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,066
From Tosaka Real Estate.

295
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,467
He said I can call him anytime
if I still have any concerns.

296
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,967
I agree. I think you should
rip the plaster off now and sell.

297
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,734
I've had it up to here
with that investment.

298
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,500
MICHIKO SHINOZAKI
MR. SHINOZAKI'S WIFE

299
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,600
Don't worry about Kotono's school fees.

300
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,033
Yes, it's a private school.

301
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,000
And yes, it's three times
more expensive than public school.

302
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,233
But I'll make sure we get by.

303
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,533
I wish she weren't just following
her friends to this damned school.

304
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,767
SHUKEI UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL
2024 PROSPECTUS

305
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:33,767
Leave her be.

306
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:38,500
She got into such a hard school
with such a simple motive.

307
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,133
She's worked hard for it.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,100
We should support her.

309
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,300
Of course I support her.

310
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm back.

311
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,767
KOTONO SHINOZAKI
MR. SHINOZAKI'S DAUGHTER

312
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,834
Welcome back, Kotono.
Dinner will be ready soon.

313
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,667
Come on. Get changed.

314
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,300
I don't need to be told.

315
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Hey, what's our annual income?

316
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,233
Why do you ask?

317
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,066
You don't have to worry about any of that.

318
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:14,934
Fine.

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,266
JEWEL YAOKI
TOSAKA - MINERVA

320
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Kotono?

321
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,000
You should be in bed.

322
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm just getting a drink.

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Good night.

324
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,700
YAOKI COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

325
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,367
Good morning.

326
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,934
Good morning.

327
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,400
Shouldn't we be parting ways soon?

328
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,300
What's this?

329
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:04,233
Saichi is the type to be embarrassed
by walking to work with his partner?

330
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,100
I have absolutely no shame
in walking with my partner.

331
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,667
It's just, we don't know
who could be watching, so…

332
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
No way.

333
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,600
Make sure you come home early tonight.

334
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,266
I'll do my best.

335
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,200
NUMBER OF CONTRACTS
61 CONTRACTS

336
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,467
Well done, Kurosu.

337
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:39,033
See what happens when I put my mind to it?

338
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:43,233
Well, I have to yield sometimes,
lest management start begrudging me.

339
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,834
I haven't lost yet…

340
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,700
Mr. Nagase.

341
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,467
What?

342
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,367
I know results are important to you,

343
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,600
but you've been putting in
so many long hours,

344
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,133
so I think you deserve to go home early.

345
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,166
-What?
-Miss Tsukishita, you have a client.

346
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,100
Okay, thanks.

347
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,800
Thank you for giving up
Mr. Unno as your client.

348
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,533
I made a sale thanks to you.

349
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,934
I didn't give him up.

350
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,367
Mr. Unno was very pleased.

351
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,066
Now he'll be able
to make back what he lost

352
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,734
through that infamous
TBG Corporation scandal.

353
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
TBG?

354
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,300
So he was also a victim
of the TBG Corporation scandal?

355
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,467
I'm off to get lunch.

356
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,100
TBG Corporation
went bankrupt two years ago.

357
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,734
Hello, Mr. Tosaka.

358
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,166
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

359
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,266
Kurosu's in the lead right now?

360
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,500
All of our employees are doing their best
through friendly competition.

361
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,767
MR. FUMIHIKO SHINOZAKI
CALL

362
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,400
Is that the guy
with the studio investment?

363
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,867
The one who nearly bought Jewel Yaoki?

364
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,934
He might need reminding.

365
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,500
Just leave it.
It's not like he's our client anymore.

366
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,400
Yes.

367
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,633
Getting hung up on this

368
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,233
could just be falling for Kamiki's trap.

369
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Something wrong?

370
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,800
I was worried about a client
who came seeking advice,

371
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,100
but it's all right.

372
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,967
I've got my eyes firmly set
on being number one this month.

373
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:32,066
Yes, well, we're not a charity.

374
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:33,867
No, we're not.

375
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:39,533
Still, as a real estate agency,
it's not just our clients propping us up.

376
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,734
We can only operate
so long as the people are thriving.

377
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Remember that.

378
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:49,500
Yes, sir.

379
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,467
Well, hello there, Mr. Shinozaki.

380
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,200
Mr. Kamiki?

381
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,667
Are you headed home?

382
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Yes.

383
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,200
I wonder if I could have
a moment of your time.

384
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,200
Here.

385
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:18,500
Thank you.

386
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,500
That studio apartment
you recommended I purchase,

387
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,900
I'd like to pass on it.

388
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,266
I was going to call and let you know.

389
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,300
I see.

390
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,600
My wife's sick of investing--

391
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,033
Don't you get it, Mr. Shinozaki?

392
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
You, good sir,

393
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:52,000
are standing at a crossroads
between victory and defeat.

394
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,033
What?

395
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Mr. Shinozaki.

396
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,967
The moment of defeat,
do you know when that is?

397
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,066
Well…

398
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,200
It's the minute you decide to give up.

399
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,333
Do you want everything to be for naught?

400
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,033
Of course not--

401
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,533
Are you willing to pass up the chance
of a lifetime to get it all back?

402
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,333
I have a chance…

403
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,800
I have him hooked.

404
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,000
This is the sunk cost effect.

405
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:39,166
The psychological tendency of becoming
emotionally attached to an investment.

406
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,300
You can't give up, Mr. Shinozaki.

407
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:45,367
You can turn it around.

408
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:48,834
I suppose I can.

409
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,200
Next is the Dunning-Kruger effect.

410
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:57,867
The psychological tendency to overestimate
one's own competency or abilities.

411
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,066
Mr. Shinozaki.

412
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,300
I do believe you are the sort of person
who doesn't give up that easily.

413
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:13,166
You have a daughter going to
a private high school this spring.

414
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,700
Think of your family.

415
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,834
This is your moment to put your foot down
as head of the household.

416
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,166
Are you in?

417
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,767
But you agreed
we were done with investing?

418
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,433
If we give up now,
we'll be left with nothing.

419
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,800
We don't have to do this.

420
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:47,400
Kotono will be going to college
in three years.

421
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:52,200
Yes, but we've already spoken about this.

422
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,867
We'll make sure we succeed this time.

423
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,266
You have a good eye!

424
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,734
Very well.

425
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,533
As the number one sales rep,
you can leave the rest to me.

426
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Thank you.

427
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,734
Here is the application form.

428
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,834
Mr. Nagase, you're not still
vying with Mr. Kurosu, are you?

429
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,333
Of course I am.

430
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:20,867
But I'm still worried about Mr. Shinozaki
after that one meeting we had together.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,266
Don't worry.

432
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,066
That's what makes you "you."

433
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,133
Hello. Saichi Nagase
from Tosaka Real Estate.

434
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,667
I'm going to Minerva.

435
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:35,900
I'll come with you.

436
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,500
Don't worry about it.

437
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:39,834
I want to hear them too.

438
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,200
Mr. Nagase? What are you doing here?

439
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,533
I got a call from Kotono.

440
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,800
From Kotono?

441
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,633
Kotono?

442
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:56,867
How do you even know Mr. Nagase?

443
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,734
From before.

444
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:07,200
Good night.

445
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,333
TOSAKA - NAGASE
MINERVA - KAMIKI

446
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,633
Here.

447
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,734
TOSAKA - NAGASE
MINERVA - KAMIKI

448
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:25,600
Thank you.

449
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:27,767
It's almost time.

450
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:33,000
I've arranged a meeting
regarding the Nishi-Kokubunji property.

451
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:36,900
You're going to purchase
the Jewel Yaoki, aren't you?

452
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,867
Kotono told me.

453
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,000
I've thought it over.

454
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:48,533
I'm sure you've thought long and hard.

455
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,667
But they say,
"Once a fool, always a fool,"

456
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,200
and you, my friend,
are a prime example of that!

457
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,333
In my opinion.

458
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:14,100
It seems a client list belonging
to TBG Corporation is making the rounds.

459
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,433
It's made its way into the hands
of some morally corrupt people.

460
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,233
Mr. Shinozaki, it seems you've been unable
to break free from your cycle of hell.

461
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,433
No, but--

462
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,567
Kotono is scared this is all her fault
for wanting to go to a private school.

463
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,367
That's why she called me.

464
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
I…

465
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,900
I've done some research…

466
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,066
Families that earn
less than 10 million yen per year

467
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,667
get government-backed financial support
for private school fees.

468
00:26:58,734 --> 00:26:59,800
FINANCIAL SUPPORT WEBSITE

FINANCIAL AID TO ENTER
HIGH SCHOOL - SUPPORT FOR FEES

470
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,967
Applications open in April.

471
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:08,767
Kotono.

472
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,567
I told you.
You don't have to worry about any of this.

473
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,667
Just leave it to your father.

474
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,100
You've got your priorities wrong!

475
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,800
What do you mean by wrong priorities?

476
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,934
Please. Let's hear it, Kotono.

477
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,300
I don't want

478
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:42,734
to go to Shukei University High School
just to be with my friends.

479
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:55,033
I've heard their legal faculty
is one of the best in the field…

480
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:02,100
and I'm thinking
I'd like to be a lawyer in the future.

481
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
A lawyer?

482
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:09,500
A lawyer? Why a lawyer all of a sudden?

483
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,266
It's not sudden.
It's what I've always wanted.

484
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:18,800
I want to help those
who have been tricked by the bad guys.

485
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,233
Because I know…

486
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,767
decent, hardworking people
often find themselves in that situation.

487
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
You mean…

488
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
So,

489
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,300
Dad.

490
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,033
You don't have to push so hard.

491
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,533
But how can I stand proud
as your father like that?

492
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:05,400
You've both done a great job at parenting.

493
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,166
Just look at this noble young woman
you've raised together.

494
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:19,633
There's more to parenting
than just offering financial support.

495
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Come on, honey.

496
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,567
I think we should listen to this man
from Tosaka rather than Minerva.

497
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:39,700
If you decide to go with me,

498
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:45,333
I'll make sure you get a good price
for your Nishi-Kokubunji property.

499
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:53,767
Kotono.

500
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,567
What made you decide to call Mr. Nagase
instead of Mr. Kamiki?

501
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,667
Because I've heard of Mr. Nagase.

502
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,900
I'm a volunteer
at the commercial district clean-up.

503
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:12,834
Mr. Nagase.

504
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,867
Thanks for your help before.

505
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:19,734
You really helped me out
with the rent on my store.

506
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,133
Everyone's talking about him.

507
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,934
They say Mr. Nagase from
Tosaka Real Estate is honest and reliable.

508
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,467
Really?

509
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:39,934
You're going to leave everything
with Mr. Nagase from Tosaka Real Estate?

510
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,133
No, it's fine.

511
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,500
I understand, Mr. Shinozaki.

512
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be of any help.

513
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:51,967
Goodbye.

514
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,033
Kamiki.

515
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,767
I don't know what you're up to
in the shadows,

516
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,934
but your crafty ways don't work
on Tosaka Real Estate now.

517
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:17,367
If you want to compete,
you have to play fair.

518
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:26,166
No, wait. Please!

519
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,734
Circumstances have changed.
I can see clearly now.

520
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,800
I'll bet I'd only lose money anyway.

521
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:38,166
I don't want to live in fear any longer.

522
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,233
So…

523
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:44,533
I'd like to pull out of our deal.

524
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,233
I pulled all the strings
to get you this contract.

525
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,066
I told you it'd be impossible
to break it after the fact!

526
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:54,767
Circumstances

527
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,133
have changed.

528
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,967
I'm back.

529
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,767
Mr. Nagase.

530
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,667
-Mr. Kurosu's in trouble.
-What?

531
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:06,567
He's just come back
from negotiating with a client.

532
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,834
I shouldn't have taken Nagase's client.

533
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:11,600
Now he wants to renege on the contract.

534
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Is that the studio investment property?

535
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,934
He says he doesn't need to invest anymore.

536
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,433
What do you mean?

537
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,700
His wife was ill,
and he wanted an income for her.

538
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:25,767
But…

539
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:29,133
now she's dead.

540
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,834
So, Mr. Unno's deposit is forfeit?

541
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,800
Mr. Kurosu set the contract up
with a token payment.

542
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,033
Token payment?

543
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,700
Let's break it down.

544
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:43,900
A token payment is technically cash paid
as part of the price

545
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:46,800
after the conclusion
of a property contract.

546
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,433
LAST RESORT

547
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,567
Executing a contract with a token payment
instead of with a deposit

548
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,834
is one way to reduce up-front costs.

549
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,834
But as soon as that payment is made,

550
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,166
it kicks off the contract
and there is no way to back out.

551
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,233
CONTRACT EXECUTED

552
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,734
SEVERE PENALTIES MAY APPLY
FOR BACKING OUT

553
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,633
While not illegal, it is a heavy-handed
sales tactic not frequently used.

554
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,834
So it's not that he can't get out at all.

555
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:17,567
But it requires both the buyer
and the seller to agree,

556
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,367
and there could be a hefty penalty.

557
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,200
The property sold for 20 million yen.

558
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,867
That could fetch
a four-million-yen penalty.

559
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:28,133
Four million?

560
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,467
Has the seller even agreed
to terminate the contract?

561
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,767
The settlement was to take place
in three days.

562
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,767
I think they're saying it's too late now.

563
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,166
What are you going to do, Kurosu?

564
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,100
I see you've been talking.

565
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:57,000
Let's work this out together.

566
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,600
There's nothing to work out.

567
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:04,133
I explained everything
clear as day to Mr. Unno,

568
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,633
and he never even told me about his wife.

569
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,066
He reaps what he sows.

570
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:12,233
Why can't he just keep the damn thing
as an investment for himself?

571
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:15,233
Investment properties
are difficult as it is.

572
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,400
Is he even in a position to keep going?

573
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,066
It's not your problem.

574
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,934
Mr. Kurosu.

575
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,300
Full commission means
my job's always on the line.

576
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm ready for that!

577
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:37,333
I don't need rescuing by some hobby-hero.

578
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,066
Have it your way.

579
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,233
How I wish I could just leave it at that,

580
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,266
but you're in this mess because
of this tiff between me and Kamiki.

581
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:54,000
I'd be the worst kind of human
if I just left you out to dry.

582
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,333
We have three days until settlement.

583
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
We can find another buyer
to replace Mr. Unno

584
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:03,867
and use that as leverage
to get the seller to lessen the penalty.

585
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,133
Impossible.

586
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,767
I'll help.

587
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,133
Which property is it?

588
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:12,333
-Here.
-Tsukishita, stop.

589
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
It's this one.

590
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:16,233
I'll help too.

591
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:19,467
Tokage, you help
until it's time to clock out.

592
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:20,533
Roger that.

593
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,700
Use it, or don't. It's up to you.

594
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,533
Is this…

595
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,266
Fujiwara's client list?

596
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,266
Better get to it.

597
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,266
Hello, how are you doing?

598
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,767
-Tokage, start picking clients.
-I'm from Tosaka Real Estate.

599
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,867
-Sure thing.
-Yes, it's been a while.

600
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:54,533
Can you send me the additions?

601
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,200
Already sent.

602
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:58,500
No call again.

603
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,100
TACT - MINUS

604
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,633
SAICHI NAGASE
FUTURE HUSBAND GRADE

605
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,367
WORK - THREE

606
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:12,500
But he gets full points
for dedication to his work.

607
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,900
WORK - FIVE

608
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,900
Concluded through a token payment,
you say?

609
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,834
Very pushy of him.

610
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,467
This Mr. Kurosu,

611
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:30,667
may have just been using you.

612
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,667
He used me?

613
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,433
He threw you under the bus

614
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,567
to improve his sales performance.

615
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,266
HELPING YOU FIND A HOME

616
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,333
Really?

617
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,934
Thank you so much!

618
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:55,500
Yes!

619
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,967
I found a new buyer.

620
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,533
Well done, Kurosu!

621
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,033
Damn, he beat me to it.

622
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:08,200
I'll go and speak with the seller
to cancel Mr. Unno's contract.

623
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:09,266
Right.

624
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,066
I'll come with you.

625
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,367
Okay.

626
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,667
Honestly, I think it'll help.

627
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Great.

628
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,567
We'll be back.

629
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,000
-Go get 'em!
-Will do.

630
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,867
Hello. Mr. Nagase?

631
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,000
It went perfectly.

632
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:38,400
Mr. Kurosu is a natural at negotiations.

633
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:40,066
Really?

634
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,633
How'd it go?

635
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,166
Kurosu convinced the seller
to be compassionate

636
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,266
and they agreed
to completely waive the penalty.

637
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,033
Completely waived it?

638
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,600
I'll bet Kurosu's got
a big grin on his face.

639
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,967
I mean…

640
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,333
If anything, he seems bashful.

641
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,767
Get off that phone. Let's go.

642
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:01,900
Okay.

643
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Okay.

644
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,266
We're about to go tell
Mr. Unno the good news.

645
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,800
Mr. Unno! I have some great news for you.

646
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,767
Why are you so happy?

647
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,567
Why the big smile?

648
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:22,233
Wait, listen to me! I have some good news.

649
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't want to hear it
from a giant fraud like you!

650
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,033
-Don't push me.
-What are you doing?

651
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,600
Mr. Kurosu!

652
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,567
Tsukishita?

653
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,133
What happened?

654
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,233
Tsukishita?

655
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,700
Mr. Kurosu from Tosaka Real Estate.

656
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,800
A disgruntled client of his
pushed him down the stairs.

657
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,867
Really?

658
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:54,233
Seems it was out of desperation,
as the guy had just lost his wife.

659
00:38:55,533 --> 00:39:00,166
It was the guy
Kamiki was dealing with before.

660
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:08,767
TBG CORPORATION - KEITO UNNO

661
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,834
Kamiki.

662
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,533
Mr. Unno already felt like a loose cannon

663
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,800
the entire time I was making my pitch.

664
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,367
I knew I wouldn't get
any business from him,

665
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,600
but I figured I might aim him
at Tosaka Real Estate.

666
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,567
You did this.

667
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,333
I'm just as surprised as you are.

668
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,533
That said,

669
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:47,000
if only that realtor
had turned his mind to Mr. Unno's family,

670
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,500
perhaps it needn't have come to this.

671
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,734
YAOKI GENERAL HOSPITAL

672
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,166
Hello.

673
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,233
Are you all right?

674
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,967
You didn't have to visit.

675
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,233
How are you feeling?

676
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:10,533
Mr. Unno is so sorry for what he did.

677
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,800
He said he can't thank you enough.

678
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,867
He said he's glad you were able
to fix the property issue for him,

679
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:23,834
and he's grateful
you aren't going to press charges.

680
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:27,600
It was only an accident.

681
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,934
Solving problems without a hitch.

682
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,433
That's true full commission.

683
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,633
Liar Nagase, at it again.

684
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,000
But it's all right now.

685
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,266
I'm going back to my hometown
to take on the family inn.

686
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,467
-What?
-What?

687
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,667
My parents have been on my back
for me to take over for them.

688
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:56,900
You're kidding.

689
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:58,934
We all know you're a salesman at heart.

690
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,300
I'll be putting my skills to use
as the head innkeeper.

691
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm sorry. This was my fault.

692
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,934
Got you!

693
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,667
I was number one
right up until the very end.

694
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,200
Now you'll never get the chance
to beat me again.

695
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Damn you!

696
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
Well, we'll be off.

697
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:40,667
Nagase.

698
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:46,467
Don't you let Minerva beat you.

699
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,333
Of course not.

700
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,166
You really mean it?

701
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,266
Haven't you realized?

702
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,266
I cannot tell a lie.

703
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,967
Do you think Kamiki planned
for it all to get so out of hand?

704
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,233
I wonder why he'd go that far.

705
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:26,367
At any rate,
we can just keep doing our best.

706
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:27,633
-Right.
-Yes.

707
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,700
-Let's eat!
-Let's eat.

708
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,667
-Welcome!
-Hello.

709
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,900
So you're not at work.
You're having dinner here.

710
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,433
You could have at least sent me a message.

711
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:46,934
-How are you?
-Good, thank you.

712
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,567
Work's only just settled down from today--

713
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,900
I'll have a draft beer.

714
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,200
One draft beer.

715
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,600
Did something happen?

716
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,333
It's just that Minami, well,

717
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,667
she said to let her know
whenever you showed up.

718
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,233
Testing, testing.

719
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,867
What? You're connected?

720
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:03,200
Enomoto here. Over.

721
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:04,600
What are you, a spy? Geez!

722
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:07,066
Wow, that thing's huge.

723
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:13,133
So, can I ask you something?

724
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,800
Yes?

725
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:16,700
Well, it's just,

726
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:20,266
I saw you guys
walking to work together before--

727
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,600
Tsukishita. Stop.

728
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,200
No, I want to get it out in the open.

729
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:24,266
Don't.

730
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,567
You're living together, aren't you?

731
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,700
You're really asking me that?

732
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,066
Seriously?

733
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,834
It's not that we're living together--

734
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,834
Yes, we are currently cohabiting together.

735
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,467
This "wife" forced her way in and won't
even let me have a good-night kiss!

736
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,667
How dare you put it like that?

737
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:47,633
-Wife?
-In inverted commas.

738
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,300
Really? Congratulations!

739
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:51,467
Finally!

740
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:53,967
It's still early days to be celebrating.

741
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,800
He's only been short-listed.

742
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,066
Still!

743
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm so happy.

744
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,266
Damn, I want to be able to lie again.

745

747

This has nothing to do with you. Leave!
How can we trust a realtor?

748
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:17,066
Wait! Don't go any further!

749
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:18,166
We'll come in first place.

750
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,066
Can you help them?

751
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:22,934
You're the only one who can do it.
