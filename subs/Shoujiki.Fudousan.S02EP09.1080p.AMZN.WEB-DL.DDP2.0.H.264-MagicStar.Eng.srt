MINERVA REAL ESTATE

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,333
These are the landlords with whom
we have a sublease contract, aren't they?

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:13,834
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,433
None of these landlords
are profitable to us.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,533
SUBLEASE CONTRACT

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,133
I want you to reduce their rents
down to the bare bones.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,533
Reduce their rent?

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,834
I don't think
they'll take too kindly to that.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,834
If they kick up too much of a fuss,

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,633
make them break their side of the contract

11
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,333
and make them pay the penalty.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,000
A penalty?

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,266
We, of course, are free
to withdraw from the contract,

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,967
but it's designed to incur huge penalties
if the owners wish to do so.

15
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,266
That's the goal.

16
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:47,967
Isn't that right, sir?

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,500
Exactly.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,333
And now it's time.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,200
It's endgame for this town.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,066
And when this town is ours,
then we move on to Tachikawa.

00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,767
-Good morning.
-Morning.

27
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:34,633
Fujiwara's landlord friends have advised
us that Minerva is ripping them off.

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,367
-Ripping them off?
-Yeah.

29
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:39,400
They're in sublease contracts
with Minerva Real Estate.

30
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,600
SUBLEASE CONTRACT (AKA SUBLET)

31
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,934
The terms are stifling
and they want to cancel,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,166
but they're demanding a huge penalty.

33
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,100
Let's break it down.

34
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,667
MR. OKAWA'S REAL ESTATE CLASS

35
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,033
Under a sublease contract,

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,300
a property owner can entrust
their property to an agency

37
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,333
in exchange for a guaranteed
monthly rental income.

38
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,300
The advantages?

39
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:02,367
Not only will the agency find
all of the tenants,

40
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:06,567
but a monthly rental income is guaranteed,
even if the property is vacant,

41
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,033
thus reducing the risks to the owner.

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,934
But there are also disadvantages.

43
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,033
Under a sublease contract,

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,133
the relationship between owner
and agency is one of lessor and lessee.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
As such, the Act on Land
and Building Leases applies.

46
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,934
The agency is largely protected
as a tenant under this Act.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,934
The agency, as the tenant,

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,166
can demand a rent reduction
midway through the contract,

49
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,100
and some contracts do not allow an owner
to escape without paying a hefty fee.

50
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,166
MONEY PROBLEMS

51
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,066
That's right.

52
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,033
SUBLEASE CONTRACT

53
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:38,967
Mrs. Matsui.

54
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,233
Can you tell me
exactly what Minerva told you?

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,400
Well, Miss Tsukishita, let me tell you.

56
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:45,400
My son said--

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
Mom.

58
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,133
-What are you doing? Hang up!
-Wait--

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,700
-Hang up!
-Mrs. Matsui. Hello?

60
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,133
What is it?

61
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:57,033
You remember Mrs. Matsui, right?

62
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,166
She's the wife of the mayor
who died five years ago.

63
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:01,667
I remember.

64
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:06,233
She called to ask me
something about Minerva,

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,600
but just now her son made her
hang up on me.

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,133
They're really at it again?

67
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,266
THIS MONTH'S SLOGAN:
DEALS OVER FLOWERS

68
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,867
Mornin'.

69
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,166
What?

70
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,000
What's with the suit and shoes?

71
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,867
You noticed? They're new.

72
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,834
I thought you didn't care for that?

73
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,600
I've been playing around
with trading in crypto,

74
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:39,900
and I'm making an absolute killing.

75
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,600
CRYPTOCURRENCY - A TYPE

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,200
Check out the watch. One mil.

78
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:46,734
Well done.

79
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,033
Sorry, could you please wait?

80
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,133
Sir.

81
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,100
Kamiki.

82
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,133
This takes me back.

83
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,633
Everything's the same as always.

84
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:17,133
You. What are you doing here?

85
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,166
I'm here to do some scouting.

86
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:23,633
Scouting?

87
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,433
Minerva will soon be opening
a new branch in Tachikawa.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,300
I will be its manager.

89
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:35,934
I figured some of you
might like to join me over there.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,100
Of course we don't!

91
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,533
Are you sure?

92
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Tosaka Real Estate
is headed down the drain.

93
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:51,166
Isn't this just another questionable
venture in exploiting legal loopholes?

94
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,166
Wouldn't you like to know?

95
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,133
Cut the innocent crap!

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,834
Kamiki. It's been a while.

97
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:03,533
Mr. Tosaka.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
You look well.

99
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,133
Why did you come back to real estate?

100
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,100
To come in first.

101
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:22,934
You're still on about that.

102
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,767
I will continue to be number one
in the real estate industry.

103
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,600
Because I promised.

104
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,900
A promise?

105
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:55,367

108
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,333
Wow, that's delicious.

109
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,834
What are these pickles?

110
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,233
They're homemade.

111
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,934
Lotus root and daikon, pickled overnight.
Do you like them?

112

COOKING - SAICHI

113
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,734
-They are so good.
-I'm glad.

114
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
You'll have to give me the recipe.

115
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,066
Of course.

116
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,734
And also, is coming in first
really such a big deal?

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
What?

118
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,633
I'm talking about Kamiki.

119
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Right.

120
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:31,967
There was that one time
when Kamiki had traveled to Macau

121
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,700
and I managed to overtake him
and come in first.

122
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,467
He submitted his letter
of resignation the following day.

123
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,033

TOSAKA REAL ESTATE

125
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,133
Why?

126
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,967
Because I did not come in first.

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,266
90% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR
96 CONTRACTS

128
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,233
He quit?

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,433
Just because he lost first place
that one time?

130
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,266
It must have meant everything to him.

131
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,266
I hope you don't feel that way.

132
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:05,834
What?

133
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,200
There are more important things
than coming in first.

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,633
Is this it?

135
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,133
Thank you.

136
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,734
I got the wrong idea?

137
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:35,967
SUBLEASE CONTRACT

138
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,133
What do you mean?

139
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm saying we're requesting to reduce
the rent on all of your properties

140
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,734
from the current 95,000 yen to 90,000 yen.

141
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,867
You said this was a safe investment
because I'd have a guaranteed income.

142
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,433
NAOTO YAMADA
REAL ESTATE INVESTOR &amp; EMPLOYEE

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,900
Market prices have fallen in the area.

144
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:58,233
I'm already paying you 30%
of the rent in administrative fees.

145
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:03,667
But I looked into it, and it looks like
you're only meant to be charging 10-20%.

146
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,300
You're already ripping me off,
and now you want me to go down to 90,000?

147
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,800
All I'd end up with is 63,000 yen.

148
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,367
That's not even enough to break even!

149
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,066
I am truly sorry.

150
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,133
I want out.

151
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,066
I can't trust you guys.

152
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,467
Article 28 of the Act on Land
and Building Leases

153
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:25,633
requires justifiable grounds for a lessor
to terminate their contract.

154
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,166
A REQUIRED CRITERIA

155
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,467
FOR APPLYING TO TERMINATE
A CONTRACT

156
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,967
An owner feeling inconvenienced

157
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,000
is not grounds for termination.

158
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,100
What?

159
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,300
If you still truly wish to terminate,

160
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
you'll have to pay a hefty penalty.

161
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:46,300
The penalty would be 18 months' rent
on all of your properties, which would be

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,100
in the area of 20 million yen.

163
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,166
I won't stand for this!

164
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,533
I'll see you in court!

165
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,066
Be my guest.

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
However, you should realize

167
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,567
that the Supreme Court
has already made rulings on this.

168
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:09,333
Sublessees are protected
under the Act on Land and Building Leases.

169
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,166
What?

170
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,867
No, no. Wait…

171
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,900
What do you mean?

172
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:18,934
Mrs. Matsui.

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
MATSUI

174
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,834
I'd like to help you if I can.

175
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,333
You're a very important client of mine.

176
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:27,467
If you're in trouble,
you can tell me anything.

177
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,300
EMI MATSUI
WIFE OF THE FORMER MAYOR

178
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,834
Thank you, Miss Tsukishita.

179
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:35,667
But my son doesn't want us
to ask for any help.

180
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:40,300
Has Minerva said something to him?

181
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,000
Mrs. Matsui? Mrs. Matsui!

183
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,600
Ms. Hanasawa?

184
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,166
What did you say to Mrs. Matsui's son?

185
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,266
I didn't say anything.

186
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:03,867
It was Kamiki.

187
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
What?

188
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,633
Tsukishita.

189
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,500
Can you help me?

190
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,433
Kamiki's weakness?

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Yes. Can you think of anything?

192
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,500
Why are you asking?

193
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,433
I mean,

194
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,333
isn't it just standard practice
to aim for your opponent's weak spot?

195
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,133
That's what Oda Nobunaga said.

196
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,734
-Did he?
-Wait.

197
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,233
Was it Hideyoshi?

198
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,100
Ieyasu?

199
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,333
Napoleon?

200
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,500
But don't you hate it
when people act unfairly?

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
What?

202
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,800
No, this is different.

203
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,166
I don't know if I'd call it a weakness,

204
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,934
but I know what he loves more
than three square meals a day.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,834
What is it?

206
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
-Money, right?
-Wrong.

207
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,533
-Alcohol?
-Wrong.

208
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,734
Sweets? Tasty treats?

209
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,133
Couldn't be more wrong.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,333
The correct answer is

211
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,266
making bets.

212
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,567
-Making bets?
-Yep.

213
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,367
Well, that's vague.

214
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:05,500
But, Mr. Nagase, you said it yourself.

215
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,433
I only ever beat him once.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,700
Kamiki had been away
for half the month in Macau.

217
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:13,867
Right. Macau.

218
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,700
He was going all out
at the casino at the time.

219
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:23,900
Ms. Hanasawa,
I couldn't find Mr. Kamiki's weakness,

220
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,734
but I did find out what he likes.

221
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,734
It seems he's often going to Macau
because he likes to gamble.

222
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,166
Macau?

223
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:35,433
Kamiki, there's this hot-shot landlady
called Mrs. Kamogawa.

224
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,300
She's not listening to a word I say.

225
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,300
Can you talk to her instead?

226
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,500
Mrs. Kamogawa?

227
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,266
I'm pretty sure…

228
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,133
SUZUKA KAMOGAWA
SUBLEASE PROPERTY INFORMATION

229
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,567
…she likes to gamble,
and she often travels to Macau.

230
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Got it.

231
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,667
Thank you.

232
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,834
This is about what that young Nishioka guy
was talking to me about, right?

233
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,967
I have had my concerns
about that property.

234
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
SUZUKA KAMOGAWA
RESTAURATEUR &amp; PROPERTY OWNER

235
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:15,133
He said the market had dropped
and there was no way around it,

236
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,967
but I looked into it myself,
and the market has not dropped.

237
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,066
What do you say to that?

238
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,834
I'm not entirely averse
to dropping my rent.

239
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,533
But I do hate
people trying to pull a fast one on me.

240
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,367
So you can go.

241
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:36,767
Wait, please.

242
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,734
I'd like to take over for you from now on.

243
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,200
And what would I get
out of this new exchange?

244
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,567
Whatever you desire.
Name it, and it shall be yours.

245
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,834
Name it and it's mine?

246
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,500
What are you, a genie?

247
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,433
Indeed I am.

248
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,767
I will be your servant,
completely indebted to you.

249
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,567
Tell me, what do you want?

250
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,200
Mistress.

251
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,000
What a smarmy act.

252
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,100
No one would ever--

253
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,000
I could get used to this.

254
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,333
She fell for it?

255
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,266
Is a stroke of the ego all it takes
to sway a high-flying lady mogul?

256
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,934
This is bad. I have to change the subject.

257
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:40,133
Mrs. Kamogawa, are you still traveling
to Macau these days?

258
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,967
I'm not. I've just been
far too busy these days.

259
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,533
You like to go to Macau?

260
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,133
Yes, I go multiple times a year.

261
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,433
I just love going to the casino.

262
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,100
I love it there too.

263
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Nothing beats the unique tension there.

264
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,867
Yes, it's simply the best.

265
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,934
So you're both casino fans.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,800
I wonder who the luckier one is?

267
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,734
I tell you what,
I've never once lost a bet.

268
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,900
Then how about a little bet?

269
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,834
A coin toss.

270
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,133
I'm intrigued. Carry on.

271
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,834
Yes, just what I wanted.

272
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,333
If I win,

273
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,533
you'll hand this property over to me.

274
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:24,934
Very well.
I'll even consider dropping the rent.

275
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,266
I'll give you my other properties as well.

276
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,133
But what if I win?

277
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
If you win, I dedicate myself to you.

278
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,133
Heart, body, and soul.

279
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,000
You'd bet your life on it?

280
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,834
This is too fun!

281
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,133
Let's do it.

282
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,767
Mrs. Kamogawa is a sore loser.

283
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,433
More so than anyone I've ever seen.

284
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:53,133
If she were to lose, she'd simply refuse
to sign the contract out of spite.

285
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,800
This side is heads

286
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,233
and this side is tails.

287
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,934
I pick tails.

288
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,767
Then I am heads.

289
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,100
If by some chance Kamiki wins
and she doesn't get mad…

290
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,200
KAMIKI - HEADS
KAMOGAWA - TAILS

291
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:14,967
…I just have to accuse him of cheating.

292
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,600
And so there's no way

293
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,500
Kamiki can win this contract
through this little bet.

294
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,667
Which is it?

295
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,600
You see!

296
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,300
I won!

297
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,467
Well done.

298
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,934
My heart was pounding there for a second.

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,233
That was so much fun.

300
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,133
Then we're done. You can go now.

301
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,767
You won, and so I shall keep my promise.

302
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,734
DO NOT ENTER
STOP - DANGER

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Kamiki! What are you doing?

304
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,266
I told you.

305
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,800
I dedicate my heart,
body, and soul to you.

306
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,900
Wait!

307
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,934
Betting your life was just a joke!

308
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,367
I never joke around.

309
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,266
Wait! Don't go any further!

310
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,834
Kamiki, stop this at once.

311
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,033
Kamiki!

312
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Okay, okay!

313
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,767
Okay! I'll lower the rent!

314
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,367
Please don't do it!

315
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,767
You can have all of my properties!

316
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,100
Thank you, Mrs. Kamogawa.

317
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:38,467
You've helped me reach
first place again this month.

318
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,734
When my husband passed five years ago,

319
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,667
he passed all his assets on to my son.

320
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:58,000
He used that money to build the property.

321
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,000
Said he wanted to pass it
on to his own children.

322
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,567
I've been holding my tongue,

323
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,433
but something seems off about him lately.

324
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,667
But no matter how much I ask,

325
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,500
he just says everything's fine.

326
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,233
I don't know what to do.

327
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,467
-I wanted to ask you--
-Mom.

328
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,934
I'm heading out.

329
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,533
MASANORI MATSUI
MRS. MATSUI'S SON

330
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Hello.

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,934
IMPORTANT REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTS
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

332
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Masanori.

333
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,734
Are you in a sublease contract
with Minerva Real Estate?

334
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,166
I knew it.

335
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,266
In that case, I can help you.

336
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,533
-Masanori. Let's listen to what she has--
-Stop it, Mom.

337
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,934
This has nothing to do with you. Leave!
How can we trust a realtor?

338
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,533
-We're not all like Minerva.
-Get out of here!

339
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,867
-If you would just listen to me--
-Go! Leave!

340
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:53,934
-Masanori.
-Leave!

341
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
REQUEST TO REDUCE RENT

342
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,266
Why would you enter
into a subleasing contract with Minerva?

343
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,333
SHINJI HAYAMA - OUR LANDLORD
&amp; SAVIOR &amp; SUBLESSOR

344
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
I wanted to help Ms. Hanasawa out.

345
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:06,133
But then, out of the blue,

346
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,367
some Kamiki guy
is suddenly handling things.

347
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,667
Mr. Hayama, your contract says
if you want to cancel

348
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,200
you'll have to pay a huge penalty.

349
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,100
Usually it'd only be
three to six months' rent,

350
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,400
but here, it's 18 months' rent.

351
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,767
18 months?

352
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,834
This contract is difficult to terminate…

353
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,200
HAYAMA - SUBLESSOR
MINERVA - SUBLESSEE

354
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,600
…no matter how poorly you,
the sublessor, are treated.

355
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,233
PROTECTED UNDER THE ACT ON LAND
AND BUILDING LEASES

356
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,166
You mean I'm stuck?

357
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,033
Can that happen?

358
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,200
It can.

359
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,633
The Act offers protection for tenants,

360
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,567
but not for the property owners.

361
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,734
That gets distorted
in a subleasing context.

362
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,834
So the Act's full of loopholes?

363
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,033
Well, this is quite the pickle.

364
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,500
NEW MESSAGE

365
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,734
What's this?

366
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,667
Hey, this…

367
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Are you okay?

368
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:05,300
Never mind.

369
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:08,600
I just remembered I have plans.

370
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,100
-What?
-I'm leaving.

371
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,700
-See you.
-What?

372
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,567
-Wait, Mr. Hayama!
-Mr. Hayama.

373
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,166
Mr. Hayama, Mrs. Matsui's son,

374
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:24,767
everyone's having issues with
their sublease contracts with Minerva.

375
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,233
The new subleasing laws
that came into effect in 2020

376
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,633
say that the risks
need to be disclosed, right?

377
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,767
But we believe
Mr. Kamiki has not been doing that.

378
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,367
He never used to be this way.

379
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,333
He was a softy,

380
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,867
and not good with words.

381
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,667
He barely made his quotas,

382
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:56,533
and he didn't seem
at all the salesman type.

383
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,333
DADDY - ME - MOMMY

384
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,367
15 YEARS AGO

385
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,166
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

386
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,467
Shota, Daddy's home.

387
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,433
What happened to you?

388
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,133
He fell during the race at preschool

389
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,333
and so he came in last.

390
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,500
Sports day is next week, right?

391
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,300
You'll just have to come in first then.

392
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,834
I can't.

393
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,500
Of course you can.

394
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,066
You can win anything
if you put your mind to it.

395
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,400
Then maybe Daddy could lead by example.

396
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,533
All right then.

397
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,500
Daddy will also come in first
at his company this month.

398
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's be winners together.

399
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,467
With you?

400
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,033
Right.

401
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,734
I promise.

402
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
Pinkie swear, pinkie swear

403
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:02,166
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye

404
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:03,967
I promise

405
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:07,767
By the way, Shota.

406
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,266
I want to show you something.

407
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,166
You ready?

408
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,433
What sort of dance is this?

409
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,433
Tap dance.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,467
You said you wanted to learn.
Right, Shota?

411
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,033
No, Daddy!

412
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,934
He said hip hop dance.

413
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,133
What?

414
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:31,633
And I've been going to dance classes
every week so I could teach you.

415
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,967
Silly Daddy.

416
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,934
Daddy, do it again.

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,433
I like it!

418
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,100
You do?

419
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,734
All right. Watch closely now.

420
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But then…

421
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,734
there was the accident

422
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:02,500
and he was never the same again.

423
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,500
On the day of his son's sports day…

424
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,734
SHOTA FIGHT - DADDY FIGHT

425
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,567
Mommy's fried chicken is the best!

426
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,867
Yum. It's good.

427
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,000
Shota.

428
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:18,533
We'll come in first place.

429
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,200
Yeah.

430
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,066
I'll be there to see the foot race.

431
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,133
See you then.

432
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,266
See you.

433
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,667
Bye, Daddy.

434
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,900
Slow down, stay close to Mommy.

435
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,467
-You ran.
-Yeah.

436
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,266
Let's go.

437
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,734
He wasn't able to fulfill his promise.

438
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,800
Poor thing. To be so young too…

439
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:04,467
Looks like a mother and her son.

440
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,967
They died instantly?

441
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,734
DADDY

442
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,700
SHOTA FIGHT

443
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,767
Stop, you can't come through.

444
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,800
What are you doing? Step back!

445
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Shota?

446
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,233
Shota…

447
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,266
Kaori?

448
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,333
Shota!

449
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, dear…

450
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,367
I went to visit him at home…

451
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,033
MEMORIAL TABLET
OCTOBER 17, 2009

452
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,300
Daddy's gonna prove it.

453
00:24:57,367 --> 00:25:01,700
He'll prove you can come in first
if you put your mind to it.

454
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,500
No, you can't.

455
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,700
Daddy's gonna come in first at work.

456
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,166
No, I'm not lying.

457
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:21,867
Have faith in me.

458
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Shota.

459
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,533
Daddy's definitely gonna come in first.

460
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:42,500
Then that month, he really did it.

461
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,834
He was the top man in sales.

462
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,333
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

463
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
And…

464
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:06,200
he continued to be number one
for the next nine years…

465
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,800
until Nagase beat him.

466
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,633
What do you think, Shota?

467
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,233
Daddy's gotten good, hasn't he?

468
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah. You're great!

469
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:46,700
You know, when you
and Mommy first went away,

470
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,934
Daddy couldn't stop crying.

471
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,166
But I'll bet you and Mommy

472
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,266
don't like Daddy being a crybaby.

473
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:57,967
Yeah.

474
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,100
Shota.

475
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,166
Your Daddy

476
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:07,133
is gonna come in first this month,
and next month,

477
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,400
and the next month and the next.

478
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:10,567
You'll see.

479
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:16,400
Daddy's not gonna
let anyone ever beat him.

480
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Okay.

481
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,800
Shall we dance?

482
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:22,867
Yeah.

483
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
You're good.

484
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:29,567
We'll come in first place.

485
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
I promise.

486
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,066
Want to go for a bath?

487
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,333
What?

488
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,734
A bath.

489
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:03,033
A bath?

490
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,300
I'm not really feeling it today.

491
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,500
All the more reason to go.

492
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:14,533
Come on.

493
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,400
Want to get ice cream after our bath?

494
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,233
Sounds good.

495
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:32,100
What flavor will you get?

496
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,266
I'm gonna get lemon.

497
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,333
Green tea and red beans.

498
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
You old man.

499
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,233
TOSAKA REAL ESTATE
NO.1 IN THE AREA

500
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,900
What's wrong, Mr. Ishida?

501
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,633
You know a guy called Kamiki, yeah?

502
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,100
He's a former colleague of mine.

503
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,867
It's because of him

504
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,700
that the landlords around town
are at their wit's end.

505
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,033
Can you help them?

506
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,333
I'd love to help them,

507
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:36,166
but we're up against the Act
on Land and Building Leases here.

508
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,166
There's nothing I can do.

509
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,100
You could just rip it up.

510
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:43,200
This isn't something
that can be just ripped up.

511
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,867
Many laws have been wrong in the past.

512
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:51,433
They were ripped up and written anew.

513
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:54,867
Made the world a better place.

514
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,533
Anything's possible.

515
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,333
-Mr. Nagase.
-Yes?

516
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,233
You're the only one who can do it.

517
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm the only one?

518
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,734
Peace.

519
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:26,767
Everyone here is having difficulties
with a subleasing contract with Minerva.

520
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,033
PROPERTY OWNERS CURRENTLY IN
SUBLEASING CONTRACT WITH MINERVA

521
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,667
We'd like to help you out.

522
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:34,633
Didn't I already tell you
not to bother with this?

523
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,967
The fact that you're all here
after we sent the word out

524
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,567
means you all agree
something needs to be done about this.

525
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,967
-Let's go, Mom.
-Masanori?

526
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,400
We haven't finished here.

527
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:49,066
There's nothing to discuss!

528
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:50,567
Let's go.

529
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,233
You know that's not true--

530
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:01,500
You good-for-nothing,
profligate son of Mrs. Matsui!

531
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,400
Sir.

532
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,467
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING PROFLIGATE SON

533
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:09,033
Minerva tempted you
with the investment of a lifetime,

534
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,867
so you took your late father's inheritance

535
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:14,100
and used it to construct
a 200-million-yen property.

536
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,233
This guy's never invested
in real estate in his life,

537
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,233
and now he's getting ripped off
and up to his neck in debt.

538
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,133
How'd you know that?

539
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
I did some digging.

540
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,367
Is it true, Masanori?

541
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,800
And Mr. Yamada,
don't think you're off the hook.

542
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,767
You were also so tempted
by the profits promised to you

543
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:34,100
that you secretly ate into
you and your wife's savings,

544
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,633
bought an investment property,
and subleased it to Minerva.

545
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,934
PURCHASED AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY
WITHOUT TELLING HIS WIFE

546
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,166
Obviously Minerva should not have
lured you in with honeyed words,

547
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:46,166
but you were all simply too eager
to accept them at face value.

548
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,467
Far too eager!

549
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,333
You're as eager as one partner
expecting a kiss on the first date.

550
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,200
And as for the cherry on top,
that would be Mr. Hayama.

551
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,934
Me?

552
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,600
During our meeting, you got a text message
which completely changed your mood after.

553
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,633
Isn't this what you were looking at?

554
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
WE GOT TO RIDE
ON MR. HAYAMA'S YACHT

555
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:10,567
No!

556
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,700
You bought a yacht
for the tax benefits, yes?

557
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:22,266
It's meant to be
a fringe benefit for employees,

558
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,934
but no one ever gets to go on it

559
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,900
because you're always out there

560
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,567
paying gorgeous women
to join you on boat raves, aren't you?

561
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:34,133
Do you realize that if they determine
your tax write off as disingenuous,

562
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,367
it could be considered
as tax evasion, you--

563
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,433
bald old creep.

564
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,467
TAX EVADER - OLD CREEP

565
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:45,133
How did you even get this picture?

566
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:49,433
One of these lovely ladies
uploaded it to social media.

567
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,900
Oh, my God!

568
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,667
You really need to up
your crisis management skills.

569
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,133
I'll bet Kamiki sent you a similar photo

570
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,600
during that meeting
that we had, didn't he?

571
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,300
Did Mr. Kamiki tell you that
the Supreme Court

572
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,734
had already handed down rulings
when you threatened to sue?

573
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,233
He did say that.

574
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,400
The Supreme Court
has already made rulings on this.

575
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:19,400
He said sublessees are protected under
the Act on Land and Building Leases.

576
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,734
-He said that to me too.
-Minerva is just saying that to scare you.

577
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,900
You shouldn't let such a nasty company
keep you up at night.

578
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,934
But there's nothing we can do
if they've got the law on their side.

579
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,367
No, we must not give up.

580
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:38,734
Nothing will ever change
if we don't speak up now.

581
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:44,600
Corporate entities do not suffer under
this Act on Land and Building Leases.

582
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,300
It is you, small mom-and-pop investors,
who are suffering.

583
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,400
You could bury your heads in the sand,

584
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,834
but then what will happen
to all those people needing to rent?

585
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,200
Let's speak up
for the sake of our community.

586
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,800
We're going to sue
Minerva Real Estate together.

587
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,433
Sue?

588
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,133
Yes.

589
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
We'll go to trial.

590
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:18,200
A trial?

591
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,200
Go to trial?

592
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:34,567
All right.

593
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,266
Let's sue!

594
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,533
That photo doesn't scare me!

595
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,266
I'm in.

596
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:48,033
I'll join too.

597
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,266
Masanori.

598
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:54,400
Your father was this town's mayor.

599
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:59,500
He would have spoken up
for the people in his community.

600
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,600
I'll do it!

601
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,900
Come on, everyone.

602
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,533
We can do this.

603
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,700
NOTICE OF TERMINATION
OF CONTRACT

604
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:30,533
SUBLEASE CONTRACT

605
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,900
NOTICE OF TERMINATION OF
SUBLEASE CONTRACT - APPLICANTS

606
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,800
YUKIO IZUTSU - LAWYER

607
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,600
These are all the people
with whom you have a sublease contract

608
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:45,233
who would like to terminate
their oppressive contracts.

609
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,667
Do you even know what you're doing?

610
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,066
The contract may not stipulate it,

611
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,533
but an owner must have justifiable grounds
to terminate from their side.

612
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,900
They are all aware.

613
00:35:57,433 --> 00:35:59,467
They would still like to terminate.

614
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,800
If you refuse,
we'll file a class-action lawsuit.

615
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:06,834
A class-action lawsuit?

616
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,500
Go ahead. Sue.

617
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,834
The Supreme Court
has already passed judgments.

618
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:16,400
Yes, they have.

619
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,166
"They've made rulings.
They've handed down judgments."

620
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,767
You parrot that like it's the only thing
you know how to say.

621
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,767
I think it's time
to expand your vocabulary!

622
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,133
Higashino. Escort them out.

623
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Okay.

624
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:30,767
We're not leaving.

625
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,133
We can no longer ignore

626
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:40,100
what you're doing to this community.

627
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,400
The community?

628
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:44,934
When you strangle the landlords,

629
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,433
you inevitably strangle their tenants
and everyone else in the community.

630
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,667
You'll decrease the quality of life,
and people will leave.

631
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,700
Is that what you want, Kamiki?

632
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,567
You and your family
used to live around here too, right?

633
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,834
If you still insist on doing this,
then let's contest it in court.

634
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,700
But the courts
like to air out all the dirty laundry.

635
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:22,633
It's likely that all the past wrongdoings
of your president

636
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,700
will also come out
to see the light of day.

637
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,600
Are you really doing this?

638
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
I am.

639
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,667
Remember, I cannot tell a lie.

640
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,100
There's the final boss.

641
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,767
What was that?

642
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:58,667
Nothing.

643
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:02,533
I heard everything.

644
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:05,867
Mr. Nagase.

645
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:11,266
You really are fascinating, you know that?

646
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,033
Do as you please.

647
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,133
Let's go.

648
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,767
Okay.

649
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,166
You have a poor endgame, Nagase.

650
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,467
Remember what I told you?

651
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,033
You should beat down your competition
by any means necessary.

652
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,066
That's why you'll never come in first.

653
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:51,500
I don't care
about coming in first anymore.

654
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,467
I've found something
even more important than that.

655
00:38:58,533 --> 00:38:59,567
And what is that?

656
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,934
Please, do tell.

657
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,400
Come up with your own.

658
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,433
Looks like everyone got out
of their contract with Minerva

659
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,333
without needing to pay
any hefty penalties.

660
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,900
Wow, Mr. Nagase.

661
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:47,266
-You really saved me.
-No worries.

662
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,934
Wanna come for a cruise
on my yacht as thanks?

663
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,100
I'm sure the ladies will flock to us
when they hear you're coming.

664
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,200
No, Mr. Hayama. I'm fine.

665
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,567
You should take your family
or your employees instead.

666
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,567
I actually really want to go!

667
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:04,800
I wanna ride your yacht!

668
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,734
I wanna ride with all those lovely ladies!

669
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,133
Please let me come.

670
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,200
Excuse me. That was weird.

671
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:16,600
You really are an overly honest man.

672
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,500
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,700
That's why I trust you.

674
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:21,667
Thank you.

675
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,867
-I look forward to working with you.
-Yes, thank you.

676
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:26,800
Tsukishita told me.

677
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,433
About your son and your wife.

678
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,066
I have a son too.

679
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:43,033
So I can understand how much it must hurt.

680
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,300
But it's still no excuse
to go as far as you did.

681
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Don't you think it's time
to stop obsessing over being number one?

682
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
No.

683
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
I won't stop.

684
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,467
Ever since my wife and my son died,

685
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,600
I've only ever not been first once.

686
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,500
That's when

687
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,900
they disappeared.

688
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Disappeared?

689
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:19,066
When I fell to second place,

690
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:24,000
Kaori and Shota disappeared.

691
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:30,467
But as soon as I came in first again…

692
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:36,300
they came back to me.

693
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Look.

694
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,867
They're over there.

695
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,533
I never

696
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:54,000
want to lose you two again.

697
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:07,467
Did Miss Enomoto make that for you?

698
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:10,233
It's her turn today,
so she made it for me.

699
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,033
-It looks good.
-Hi, everyone.

700
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,734
Tokage? Why are you so late to work?

701

CRYPTO REAL TIME CHART

702
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,133
Crypto's crashed and I've lost it all.

703
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
CRYPTO (VIRTUAL CURRENCY)

704
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:24,533
I sold everything, the suit and the watch,
but it wasn't enough…

705
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,867
I told you to just focus on your job.

706
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,100
So, Mr. Nagase, what are you going to do?

707
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
About what?

708
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,133
About Miss Enomoto.

709
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:42,967
You can't just keep
living together, can you?

710
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:44,467
I guess not.

711
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,467
I guess I do like being with her.

712
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,700
It's like
I don't have to wear a mask around her,

713
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,000
and I can just be myself.

714
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:55,834
I've never felt this way before…

715
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:02,000
Does that mean…

716
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:05,700
I'm thinking it's about time I tell her.

717
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:08,400
Wow, really?

718
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:12,233
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Nagase.
I'm so happy for you!

719
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,300
Come on, stop it.

720
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:14,667
What?

721
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:15,834
MITSUTOMO BANK

722
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,133
You want me to move?

723
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,567
To New York?

724
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:26,967
CRYPTO REAL TIME CHART

725
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:29,333
It went down again.

726
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Tokage.

727
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,333
Here we go.

NEXT EPISODE

730
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,333
This is six years in the making.

731
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,900
I'm thinking any setbacks would be fatal.

732
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:18,734
What happens to the project
if Mr. Sayama cancels his contract?

733
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,934
Be a father who holds his head high.

734
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,967
She's a valued partner of mine.

735
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:24,934
What he said.
