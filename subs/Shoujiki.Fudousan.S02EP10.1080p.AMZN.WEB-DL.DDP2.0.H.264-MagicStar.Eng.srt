1
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:05,367
You and your family
used to live around here too, right?

2
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:07,066
I never

3
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:10,266
want to lose you two again.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,934
Remember, I cannot tell a lie.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,367
Crypto's crashed and I've lost it all.

6
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:17,800
I want to stop him.

7
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,100
It's not even about beating him.

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,533
You're the only one who can do it.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,834
I don't care
about coming in first anymore.

10
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,800
I've found something
even more important than that.

11
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:39,500
THE HONEST REALTOR 2

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,767
FINAL EPISODE
HONEST REALTOR FOREVER

13
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,667
Here, Mr. Nagase. Come say something.

14
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,600
What's up?

15
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,467
He's investing in crypto
on company time again.

16
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,567
Come on, Tokage. Don't do that.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Mr. Nagase, a reprimand doesn't work
if you do it with a smile.

18
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:02,000
You guys shooting the breeze?
Come on, back to work.

19
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,266
Why is everyone smiling
through their anger?

20
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,834
What do you mean?
This is just my resting face.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
"I got my eye on you."

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,133
I don't quite get it, but okay.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
Did something good happen?

24
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:19,033
Could it be because Minerva
has now called off the attack?

25
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,000
Now everyone's feeling relieved.

26
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,266
Well, that was good too,
but nothing like this. Right, Nagase?

27
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,433
-It's been a long time coming.
-Yep.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
A long time coming?

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,867
A six-year-long project of ours
is finally going to see the light of day.

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,967
-It nearly broke us.
-Now you're crying?

31
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:38,300
It's been so long.

32
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,533
It has.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,266
What kind of project is it?

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a large-scale development
to bring together 20,000 tsubo of land.

35
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,900
MUSASHIMURAYAMA CITY,
KASAHARA DISTRICT

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,367
-20,000 tsubo?
-It all started six years ago.

37
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,266
LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENT

38
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,667
LOGISTICS WAREHOUSE
CONSTRUCTION PLAN

39
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,133
TOKYO METROPOLIS
&amp; MUSASHIMURAYAMA CITY

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Mr. Tosaka teamed up
with a large-scale builder

41
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,633
to combine 20,000 tsubo of land
into one plot in Musashimurayama City,

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,567
with the view to build a warehouse
to sell on to a major real estate agency.

43
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:07,400
The builder is going to
purchase the land for four billion yen,

44
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,066
do their construction work,

45
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,667
and then sell the result to a large
real estate agency for 8.8 billion yen.

46
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,900
Our role in all of this

47
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:19,400
was to broker the transactions
between the leaseholders and the builder.

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,633
We made around 260 million
on those brokerage fees alone.

49
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,000
Over 200 million? That's a lot.

50
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,667
Development's finally received
the official go-ahead,

51
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,900
so we're getting close
to finally closing the contract.

52
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,467
It's been such an ordeal.

53
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,867
DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL

54
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,233
We had to get the consent
of all 80 rural leaseholders.

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
ALLOTMENT MAP

56
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,467
Come rain or shine, sleet or snow,

57
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,400
we did the rounds,
getting approval after approval.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And after all that back-breaking labor,
we're finally getting our just deserts.

59
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,934
Mr. Okawa.

60
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,033
We did good. We did good.

61
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,767
We worked so hard.

62
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,800
We worked so hard for so long.

63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Go on. Cry it out.

64
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,433

ALLOTMENT MAP

66
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,700
My legs…

67
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:17,567
Day in, day out.
So many expenses to get reimbursed…

68
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,467
What an amazing spread.

69
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,300
What's the occasion?

70
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,367
We've had a breakthrough
in a large project of ours,

71
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,934
and I'm really happy about it.

72
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,734
I see.

73
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,734
That's good news.

74
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:41,967
When this project's all done and dusted,
I have something important to tell you.

75
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,467
Something important?

76
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,567
I'll tell you later.

77
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,633
For now, let's eat.

78
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,066
Sure.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,066
You want me to move?

80
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:58,633
To New York?

81
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,567
Well, this is unexpected.

82
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,333
If it were me, I'd take it in a heartbeat.

83
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,433
LOGISTICS WAREHOUSE
CONSTRUCTION PLAN

84
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,533
This 20,000 tsubo plot of land

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,433
is supposedly getting
a giant warehouse built on top of it.

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,633
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,100
So that's what it is.

88
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,033
Some idle cropland.

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
AGRICULTURAL LAND
NOT CURRENTLY IN USE

90
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,066
How did you find this out?

91
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,800
This Tosaka project
is six years in the making.

92
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:34,300
I'm thinking any setbacks would be fatal.

93
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:38,066
Sir, I think you should stop
going after Tosaka Real Estate.

94
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,500
You have more important things to do.

95
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,200
You can quit right now
if you refuse to follow my lead.

96
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,266
I'll leave this matter

97
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,934
with you, Kamiki.

98
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,300
Thank you, sir.

99
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,700
IDLE CROPLAND

100
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:04,767
It's so big.

101
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:07,166
(PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION SITE
OF LOGISTICS WAREHOUSE)

102
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:11,033
20,000 tsubo.
That's bigger than Tokyo Dome.

103
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,734
It's pretty infested with weeds
for supposed farm land.

104
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,367
Out of the 80 householders here,

105
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,400
most struggled when they inherited
the farm and just let it go over time.

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,667
I guess you can only really sell
farming land to other farmers, can't you?

107
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:36,734
That's right.

108
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:40,133
And converting agricultural land
to anything else is a whole process.

109
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,033
REPURPOSING FARMING LAND
FOR OTHER USES

110
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
I have heard of that.

111
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,834
PERMISSION GRANTED TO CONVERT
AGRICULTURAL LAND

112
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,834
You have to get permission
from the Agricultural Affairs Committee,

113
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,433
and find a developer and get developmental
approval from the government.

114
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:56,800
Mr. Tosaka and Mr. Okawa
took care of all the legal stuff.

115
00:05:56,867 --> 00:06:00,166
They say the government only grants
one development project per year…

116
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,734
CITY COUNCILLORS A &amp; B

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,967
…so there's a long waiting list.

118
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,233
Mr. Tosaka laid all the groundwork for us,

119
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,533
but as for the clincher…

120
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,734
You didn't go to any of the dinners?

121
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,367
No, I was in charge of securing
the 80 leaseholders.

122
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,200
Eighty.

123
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:27,266
How'd you do it for 80 households?

124
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,033
MUSASHIMURAYAMA WAREHOUSE PLAN
MARCH 2018 ONWARDS

125
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,200
-With this.
-What is it?

126
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,266
It contains all the personal information
on the leaseholders.

127
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,367
I used their hobbies and their favorite
foods to make them come around.

128
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,900
It's all in here.

129
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,700
This right here
was a lifesaver for the project.

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,667
That's amazing!

131
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,834
-I really busted my butt.
-Wait.

132
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,000
-Can I see it?
-No, you cannot.

133
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,567
I need you to get that notebook for me.

134
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:55,100
You mean steal it?

135
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,867
I'll give you a million.

136
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,433
-But--
-Five million.

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,767
Five million?

138
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,967
You lost a lot on crypto, right?

139
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,700
Think of it as a good investment
of your time.

140
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,233
Well, well. Mrs. Kamogawa.

141
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,900
Thank you for all your help before,
Mr. Kamiki.

142
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,834
You asked of your faithful servant,
and I delivered.

143
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,233
You're still going on about that?

144
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,467
Of course. A promise is a promise.

145
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,467
Please, come this way.

146
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,700
That's right.

147
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:02,100
You have a store
in Musashimurayama City, don't you?

148
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,433
Yes, I do.

149
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:13,633
So, you don't want the transfer?

150
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,233
No.

151
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,000
Just so you know,
I'm the one who suggested you.

152
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,166
You did?

153
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,867
Why me?

154
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,800
Because you care about others.

155
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,033
I care?

156
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,233
You've always been a brilliant worker,

157
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,400
but you were very corporate
when it came to the customer.

158
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,767
But then you transferred here.

159
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,533
Now the people and the community
are front and center of your mind.

160
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,333
You're a very well-rounded worker.

161
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,433
Japan's not the only place in the world
that needs workers like that.

162
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,133
Why do you hesitate?

163
00:08:58,967 --> 00:08:59,967
Because

164
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
I want to get married.

165
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:05,834
So?

166
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,100
Who says you have to quit work
once you get married?

167
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,000
I know, but,

168
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,600
he has to work here.

169
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:19,367
Is he the type to think
a woman belongs in the kitchen?

170
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,567
I don't think so.

171
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
But,

172
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,967
I don't want to leave him.

173
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
I want to be with him.

174
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,700
At all times.

175
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:40,166
So…

176
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm very sorry, Ms. Aihara.

177
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,333
Who is it?

178
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
What?

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,734
Who's the lucky man?

180
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,667
Did I not tell you?

181
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,934
-Mr. Nagas--
-Not one more syllable.

182
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm going to propose.

183
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,533
Oh, my gosh!

184
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Yes!

185
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,567
What are you crying for?

186
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:12,934
Just look at you!

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,166
I mean, we've known Saichi
since he was a student.

188
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,300
Feels like it's my own--

189
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,400
Oh, my gosh. Congratulations!

190
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:22,567
He's too direct!
You'll fight, I just know it!

191
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,667
I know, but I still want to marry him.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,367
He's Saichi Nagase. Honest to a fault.

193
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,100
I love that about him.

194
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
You'll come crawling back.

195
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,600
I won't regret this.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,033
Fine.

197
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,033
I shall forever hold my peace.

198
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,767
I wish you all the very best.

199
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,700
Thank you.

200
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,767
Tonight, we drink!

201
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,133
Yes!

202
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

203
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,700
This is such great news.

204
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:09,900
You're overreacting.

205
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm not overreacting.
I'm serious. Well done!

206
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,200
This is such great news!

207
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,567
-Come on, stop it.
-This is great! So great!

208
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,467
This right here
was a lifesaver for the project.

209
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,800
I need you to get that notebook for me.

210
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,033
You lost a lot on crypto, right?

211
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,934
Really. This is really great.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What's this? Tokage?

213
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,567
Don't often see you here. What's up?

214
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:34,400
Come to celebrate the good news too?

215
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,333
I feel like crap.

216
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,700
MUSASHIMURAYAMA WAREHOUSE PLAN
MARCH 2018 ONWARDS

217
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,266
MUSASHIMURAYAMA CITY,
SAYAMA RESIDENCE

218
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,333
Mr. Sayama.

219
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,467
AKIO SAYAMA
JUNICHI, NATSUMI &amp; SHOTA SAYAMA

220
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:28,400
You are one of the leaseholders
of the idle cropland in Musashimurayama?

221
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,467
Yes.

222
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,533
And you are a teacher.

223
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,967
You teach social studies
at Yaoki Daini Middle School.

224
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,600
JUNICHI SAYAMA
MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER

225
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,400
How do you know all this?

226
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:42,300
I have an acquaintance.

227
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:47,700
I may be preaching
to the choir when I say this,

228
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,333
but are you familiar with the words
of one former Prime Minister?

229
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,934
Former Prime Minister?

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Kakuei Tanaka was a serial con man,
and they say this was his favorite saying.

231
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,467
"Give a womanizer a woman,
and a miser his money.

232
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,533
If a man is neither,

233
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,834
give yourself as his honey."

234
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,467
So, what's your vice?

235
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,667
A FEW DAYS LATER

236
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:26,900
PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
OF REAL ESTATE

237
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,900
NOTICE OF TERMINATION
OF CONTRACT

238
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,266
NOTIFIER - JUNICHI SAYAMA

239
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,367
Mr. Sayama, wait. Please.

240
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,533
What do you mean you're backing out now?

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,066
I'm sorry, Mr. Nagase.

242
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,133
I'll pay double the deposit,
but please, just cancel the contract.

243
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,500
Man…

244
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,533
Is Mr. Sayama seriously pulling out?

245
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,767
Looks like it. Mr. Nagase is trying
to convince him otherwise.

246
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,533
Wasn't Mr. Sayama's plot of land…

247
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:58,533
right in the middle
of the Musashimurayama project?

248
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,700
That's right.

249
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:04,533
What happens to the project
if Mr. Sayama cancels his contract?

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,266
It'd be game over for the project.

251
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,800
1738 - JUNICHI SAYAMA

252
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:26,333
Won't you please reconsider, Mr. Sayama?

253
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,934
I've already thought about it.

254
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,233
I'm a middle school teacher.

255
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,066
As a teacher, it's my job
to think of the community.

256
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,300
The community?

257
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,433
I have my students,
and I have my son to think about.

258
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,000
If a warehouse were to go up,

259
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,066
that'll mean more trucks,
and that's a danger to the children.

260
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,033
I'm a man all about safety.

261
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,500
If it's the safety aspects
you're concerned about,

262
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,066
we went over that five years ago.

263
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,867
-Did we?
-We did! Multiple times.

264
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,767
And you know what you said?

265
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,700
What did I say?

266
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:01,767
You said…

267
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,767
"Safety doesn't satisfy a man's belly.
Take me out for some fine sushi!"

268
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:17,467
And I took you, didn't I?

269
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,633
I took you to a sushi place
that takes bookings two years in advance.

270
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,033
Yes, but--

271
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,767
And that's not all.

272
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,567
We had white truffles from Italy,

273
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,233
fabled caviar from the Caspian Sea,

274
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,233
and legendary grade-A foie gras!

275
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
"Gourmet! Gourmet!"
You begged and you bleated.

276
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,900
And I was there to ensure
you had a good time!

277
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,333
And I hate foie gras!

278
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,066
Well, anyway.
I'd like to withdraw from this contract.

279
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,767
Wait. Mr. Sayama.

280
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Damn it.

281
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,166
This must be Kamiki's doing.

282
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,333
It doesn't matter who did it.

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
If this project falls through,

284
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,834
then our reputation will hit rock bottom.

285
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,367
I'll try talking to him again.

286
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:08,166
We've all worked long
and hard on this project.

287
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,266
We deserve to see it through.

288
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,600
I won't let it fall through.

289
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,033
Mr. Tosaka.

290
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,767
I'm a member of Tosaka Real Estate.

291
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:19,934
Let me help too.

292
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,533
I may not have much to offer,
but allow me to help where I can.

293
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,233
All right!

294
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,333
Tsukishita, you go with Nagase

295
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,066
-and bring Mr. Sayama around!
-Yes.

296
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,400
-Fujiwara and I will talk to the builder.
-Okay.

297
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:34,633
As for the rest of you,

298
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,367
make sure Minerva stays away
from the other leaseholders.

299
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,433
-Okay.
-We will.

300
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
-Do we have a list?
-Yes.

301
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,934
Mr. Sayama's quite the gourmand, right?

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,633
Leave that to me.

303
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,834
Sure.

304
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,934
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
ATSUSHI OMURA

306
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,433
LARGE-SCALE
DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVE

307
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,266
One of your leaseholders, Mr. Sayama,

308
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,367
has decided to sell his land
to us instead.

309
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:59,800
Mr. Sayama's land
is right in the middle of our project!

310
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,667
You are exactly right.

311
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,734
As the builder's representative,

312
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:09,133
I'm sure you're aware of
just how valuable this piece of land is.

313
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,667
How much would you pay for it?

314
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,867
Pay for it?

315
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:21,033
Your six-year-long project is finished
without that one little plot of land.

316
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,233
That's going to upset a lot of people.

317
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,066
It's not up to me.

318
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:44,166
I'll be waiting for the correct answer.

319
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,100
YUMMY CAKES

320
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,900
I got the cake. I'm about to find a taxi.

321
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,467
Yes.

322
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,433
Mr. Kiriyama?

323
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,266
Mr. Sayama?

324
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:13,834
Why?

325
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,266
Oh, no.

326
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:30,567
Can I help you?

327
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:44,266
Are you Mr. Akio Sayama,
Mr. Junichi Sayama's father?

328
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,266
I am.

329
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,066
Nice to see you again.

330
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,066
I'm Saichi Nagase from Tosaka Real Estate.

331
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:53,500
I came to visit six years ago
about purchasing your plot of land.

332
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,066
Mr. Nagase.

333
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,667
AKIO SAYAMA
MR. SAYAMA'S FATHER

334
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:57,734
So, can I help you?

335
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:03,667
Mr. Sayama suddenly said
he didn't want to sell us the land.

336
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:06,967
Why'd he say that?

337
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:10,367
He says he's concerned for the safety
of the children and the community.

338
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,266
He really said that?

339
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,133
Yes.

340
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,934
Well, the land's his.

341
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:27,667
I gave it to him to do with as he wishes.

342
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,033
You'll need to discuss it with him.

343
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you think I'm daft?

344
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,300
Well, no.

345
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:08,033
What do you want?

346
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,033
That man you were with before,

347
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:14,867
that was Mr. Sayama, right?

348
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,166
He's one of the leaseholders
in a Tosaka Real Estate project.

349
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,266
Now all of a sudden
he wants to cancel his contract with us.

350
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,967
Why would someone like that
be talking to you?

351
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,633
It's none of your business.

352
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,467
I hear large-scale developments like ours

353
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,033
are literal gold mines
to brokers such as yourself.

354
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,266
You're not trying
to stab us in the back, are you?

355
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,767
And what if I am?

356
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,333
Then you're dead to me.

357
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:15,834
If you're out to steal what Mr. Tosaka
and Mr. Nagase have worked so hard for…

358
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,667
then you are dead to me.

359
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:44,467
So you waited until nightfall
and you still never got to see him?

360
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,734
Hopefully you get to see him tomorrow.

361
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,867
No matter how long it takes,
I'll keep showing up every single day.

362
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,834
You really like your job, don't you?

363
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,967
I'm enjoying it even more lately.

364
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:03,066
Before I was only ever thinking
about ways to make more money.

365
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,433
What changed?

366
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,834
I guess I realized

367
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,500
my job is to help other people.

368
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,734
To help people?

369
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:24,867
I get to have such a positive impact.
Wouldn't you agree?

370
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,333
Positive impact?

371
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,700
Mr. Sayama, can we talk?

372
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,400
Not you again.

373
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,500
We only need a moment of your time.
I bought you this--

374
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,467
I don't want it. Go away.

375
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,734
-Mr. Sayama.
-Mr. Sayama.

376
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,467
Just a moment of your time--

377
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:57,767
Can't believe this…

378
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:12,166
You came all this way.

379
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,734
Why won't you say anything?

380
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,734
Well, I…

381
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,333
Shall I take a guess

382
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,667
at why you're here?

383
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,266
What?

384
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,834
There's something you want to ask me,

385
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,400
but you don't know how to bring it up.

386
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,934
You're wondering even whether
you should raise it with me.

387
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,133
How'd you guess?

388
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
It's written all over your face.

389
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,266
What?

390
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Kento.

391
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,934
Have you heard of this saying?

392
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,967
"If you want to be happy for a day,

393
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,367
visit the barber.

394
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,100
If you want to be happy for a week,

395
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:09,700
buy a car."

396
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:11,967
I know the one.

397
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,133
"If you want to be happy for a month,

398
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
marry a wife.

399
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,734
If you want to be happy for a year,

400
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
buy a house."

401
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,500
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

402
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,600
Mr. Nagase's always saying that one.

403
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,033
There's more to it.

404
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:33,433
There's more?

405
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,633
"If you want to be happy all your life,

406
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,633
be an honest man."

407
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
You see?

408
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:15,033
What is this?

409
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:19,834
I guess

410
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:23,834
I'm now a man who cannot tell a lie.

411
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,800
Come over all you want.
I won't change my mind.

412
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,667
Please, Mr. Sayama.

413
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:43,467
Our six-year-long project will be
for naught if you don't sell to us.

414
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,166
Why should I care?

415
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:50,500
You shouldn't even be building
a giant warehouse there anyway.

416
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,033
Why not?

417
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,867
I told you.

418
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:58,000
All those trucks coming in and out
are a danger to the children.

419
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,333
It's our job as teachers
to look out for the children.

420
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,166
-Your job.
-Yes.

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,734
I think that's very noble of you…

422
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,667
but I don't buy it for a second.

423
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:25,633
What an odd thing to say
for a money-grubbing teacher like you!

424
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,433
What?

425
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,834
You don't care about the kids.

426
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,000
Money, money, money.
You care about the money!

427
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,867
Of course, I like money too.

428
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:40,467
Truth be told, six years ago
when we were in negotiations,

429
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:43,567
I was nothing but lip service
in order to close a contract.

430
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,800
Because you know what I wanted? Money!

431
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,633
You get it then. So lay off my back!

432
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,033
But now I'm different.

433
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:53,000
Now I'm asking you
to think about the land.

434
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
The land?

435
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:58,433
Yes.

436
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,166
Well, well. Nagase.

437
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,934
What are you doing here?

438
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,633
Kamiki.

439
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Mr. Sayama, do not fall prey
to this man's wheedling.

440
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:16,233
I've been speaking with
the builder's representative.

441
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:20,133
They're willing to pay
whatever it takes to purchase your land.

442
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,667
I have a blank check right here.

443
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,500
Put down whatever you like.

444
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
CHECK

445
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:38,066
100 million?

446
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,533
MASATO IKARUGA
MINERVA REAL ESTATE

447
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:42,700
One billion?

448
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:45,967
Put whatever you like.

449
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:01,900
Mr. Sayama.

450
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,867
I went and visited the land the other day.

451
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:11,467
The number of residents using it
as farming land is dropping fast.

452
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,667
There's even less people compared
to when I saw it six years ago.

453
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,000
At this rate,

454
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,567
the land is only going to fall
into further disrepair.

455
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,133
But a large warehouse,

456
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,333
that'll create roads, draw new people,
and bring in more taxes.

457
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,600
It will revive the land.

458
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,834
Merely armchair speculation.

459
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,767
Nobody knows what the future might hold.

460
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,934
Many warehouses built on vacant land

461
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,133
have been left abandoned
out of pure convenience.

462
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,533
And there are just as many success stories

463
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,633
where it brings a community together.

464
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,900
I can assure you, it'll be safe.

465
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Mr. Sayama.

466
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,834
Your parents were the ones
who toiled that land, day in and day out.

467
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,600
That land raised you.
It is a great treasure.

468
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:23,400
I think you should let that treasure
come back to life.

469
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,233
For the future.

470
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:29,600
Your son's, and all your students'.

471
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:34,900
Their future?

472
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,367
Mr. Nagase, he's here.

473
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,767
Why is my dad here?

474
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,500
Mr. Sayama.

475
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:03,033
You figured we'd stop by
to convince you again,

476
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,734
and so you told your father
not to be here, didn't you?

477
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,333
I think you did that
because you have a guilty conscience.

478
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,867
No, I don't.

479
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:26,934
Junichi.

480
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,867
I gave you that land.

481
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:33,433
So do with it what you will.

482
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,033
But let me say just one thing.

483
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,200
You are a teacher,

484
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,033
so you should never act unethically.

485
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,567
Do this for your son.

486
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:59,000
Be a father who holds his head high.

487
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:53,300
Looks like Mr. Sayama changed his mind.

488
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,467
Thanks to you.

489
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,400
I only did what I felt was right.

490
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,333
Right.

491
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,033
By the way…

492
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,433
Sakura Tsukishita.

493
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,500
If you're out to steal what Mr. Tosaka
and Mr. Nagase have worked so hard for…

494
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,333
then you are dead to me.

495
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:25,734
She's become a feisty one.

496
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,600
She has, hasn't she?

497
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:47,333
This is the first time
you've called me out somewhere.

498
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,233
I'd like to ask you something.

499
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,066
Sure, but I should say

500
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,066
we've already finalized
everything with Mr. Sayama.

501
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,300
I know you have.

502
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,400
I've given up on that.

503
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,867
"Be a father who can hold
his head high for his son."

504
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,867
Those words struck me.

505
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:18,800
Remember what you said?

506
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,567
You said you'd found something
more important than coming in first.

507
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
What was it?

508
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,967
It's been on my mind all month.

509
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,467
So much so that I lost to Ms. Hanasawa
and dropped to second place.

510
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,100
I don't get it.

511
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,533
I can't think of anything.

512
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,433
What is more important

513
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,467
than coming in first?

514
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,166
I believe

515
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,266
it's bringing joy to others.

516
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,233
Whether I come in first or not,

517
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:19,834
just one positive impact

518
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:24,266
is enough to keep me happy.

519
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,200
That's how I see it now.

520
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,700
Bringing joy to others.

521
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,266
You can change.

522
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,867
I believe in you.

523
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:22,834
Shota?

524
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:24,367
Kaori?

525
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:30,266
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,266
Daddy couldn't come in first.

527
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,567
I promise next time…

528
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,333
Shota.

529
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:49,934
Wait. Don't go!

530
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,934
Look, Shota. You remember the dance?

531
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:06,066
Come on, Shota. Let's dance.

532
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,266
Don't go, Shota.

533
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,166
Shota!

534
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:13,100
Come dance with Daddy.

535
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,033
Please, Shota!

536
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,300
Hey, do that again!

537
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,533
Daddy, do it again.

538
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,100
I like it!

539
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:05,900
Kamiki?

540
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,400
Won't you please dance again, sir?

541
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,633
No, Hokuto.

542
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,900
Sorry.

543
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:13,900
You went like this.

544
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,934
What? What kind of dance is that?

545
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:18,800
You do it, Mama.

546
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,400
I can't dance.

547
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
What?

548
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,333
That's so cool.

549
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,834
Like this?

550
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,266
Sorry about him.

551
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,967
Mr. Nagase.

552
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,600
It's almost time.

553
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:03,734
-Okay.
-Here.

554
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:07,967
What?

555
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:13,000
Excuse us, we have work to do.

556
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,633
I'm here for Mr. Nagase.

557
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,266
Not for the newbie.

558
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,567
Typical. Always looking down on people.

559
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,266
Tsukishita's not a newbie anymore.

560
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,066
She's a brilliant coworker

561
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,567
and she's a valued partner of mine.

562
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,600
What he said.

563
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:38,667
Excuse us.

564
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:40,934
Let's go.

565
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,533
Come work for me.

566
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:45,967
You can name your price.

567
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,300
You can offer all the money in the world,

568
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,133
but I'll still never work for you.

569
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,166
I like where I work.

570
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,834
I like the people I work with.

571
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,667
That's the only reason.

572
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:11,066
You'll regret that answer.

573
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,734
I'll make sure of it.

574
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:22,100
I've been offered a transfer to New York,
and I'm going to take it.

575
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,200
New York?

576
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:27,767
Since spending time with you,

577
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,066
my attitude towards my work has changed.

578
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,166
I want to be honest with people,

579
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,734
and I want to face
their challenges with passion.

580
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I know I can help

581
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:44,600
individuals and their families

582
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,800
and so many others.

583
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,367
That's what I want to do with my work.

584
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,867
I know I'll regret this
if I don't do it now.

585
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:58,667
I just know it.

586
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:05,567
So,

587
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:08,867
I'm going to New York.

588
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:13,533
Minami?

589
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:16,934
Yes?

590
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,800
I think it's a great idea--

591
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:27,767
But to be honest,
I'm really gonna miss you!

592
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,433
I've loved our meals together
and chatting together.

593
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:36,000
So I hope you do well over there
so you can come back soon!

594
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:38,867
Don't worry.

595
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
For, you see…

596
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,633
I shall extend your short list period.

597
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,100
Extend?

598
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,900
You will report to me on your day,
every day, while I'm in New York.

599
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,233
JAPAN TIME 21:00 - 21:30
NY TIME 8:00 - 8:30

600
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,033
I may also drop in from time to time to
ensure you continue living up to standard.

601
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:58,934
Wait, this is even more demanding!

602
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,100
Dear god…

603
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,834
Of course it is, you're a dirty perv!

604
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Really?

605
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:07,934
Every day?

606
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:20,300
Minami.
I've been waiting for this, Minami.

607
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:29,367
G'bye!

608
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,233
Minami!

609
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Really?

610
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:41,166
She'll have hot guys
coming out the wazoo for her in New York.

611
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,166
She is very pretty.

612
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,433
She is.

613
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,033
What's this? I'm getting palpitations.

614
00:41:47,934 --> 00:41:49,633
Nagase. Come.

615
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,266
-Let us drink.
-Okay.

616
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,367
Lost loves are best washed away
with a drink.

617
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:54,867
-I wasn't dumped--
-No.

618
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:57,767
-I'm Nagase. "The" Saichi Nagase.
-It's okay, Mr. Nagase.

619
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,834
-I'm "the" Saichi Nagase.
-Relax.

620
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,567
"The" Saichi Nagase? "The"?

621
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:02,934
-It's okay.
-That's lame.

622
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,400
Mr. Nagase.

623
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:07,166
-Mr. Ishida is here to see you.
-Mr. Ishida?

624
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,233
He says he's figured out
how to break the curse?

625
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:13,500
-Hey!
-Nagase, wait!

626
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,633
For real?

627
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:20,000
-Did you really figure it out?
-What?

628
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:22,900
Do you really know how to break the curse?

629
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,500
Yeah. I do.

630
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,467
Please, tell me!

631
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:33,600
Once it's broken,
that wind will never come back.

632
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:35,433
You all right with that?

633
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,233
Never again?

634
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,066
Yep. So, what'll it be?

635
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,900
Never again?

636
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,834
Are you still upset?

637
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:53,667
Should I tell you?

638
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:58,500
You know, I've actually been cursed.

639
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:02,166
A gust of wind would hit me
whenever I tried to tell a lie

640
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,533
and I'd be forced to tell the truth.

641
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,133
Are you surprised?

642
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,867
Seriously?

643
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:15,533
What?

644
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:18,667
You really are hopeless.

645
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,400
What are you even on about?

646
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,133
Quit your blabbering,
we've got work to do!

647
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,567
But it's the truth.

648
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,533
Thank you.

649
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,000
Wow, that's good.

650
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,467
You sure are a reliable lot.

651
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:44,567
Thank you.

652
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,667
I know I can retire whenever I like
because of them.

653
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:52,100
Can't let you do that.

654
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:53,633
Why not?

655
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,266
You don't get to quit
until I quit making confectionery.

656
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:08,166
Lovely spring weather.

657
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,333
It sure is.

658
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:13,600
-What did you say, Tsukishita?
-Come on. Let's go.

659
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,834
-You called me hopeless?
-Yes, and?

660
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,400
I swear I'm telling you the truth.

661
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:19,467
What do you mean?

662
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:21,867
I'm telling you a wind
makes me tell the truth.

663
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:23,333
-What do you have there?
-I win.

664
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,967
Why are you running so fast? Wait!

665
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,533
