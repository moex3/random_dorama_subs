1
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,941
<i>Tokyo MER is a medical organization</i>
<i>that reports directly to the governor.</i>

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,477
They have just one mission.

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,512
<i>To make sure there are zero casualties.</i>

4
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,081
Some lives can't be saved by just waiting.

5
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,917
They'll never abandon anybody.

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,453
It's the anesthetist's job
to protect the patient in the OR.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,856
Doctors and nurses
aren't the only ones saving lives.

8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,392
Which is more important,
human lives or your boss's orders?

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,760
You can't operate here!

10
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,995
You're a doctor. Save these people.

11
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,065
<i>I'm a useless person.</i>
<i>Why did you pick me for MER?</i>

12
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,335
<i>The reason you became a doctor.</i>
<i>"Because I want to save lives."</i>

13
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,936
<i>Doctors like that</i>
<i>are actually hard to find.</i>

14
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:40,307
Doctors who just simply
want to save lives.

15
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,213
<i>Will you go out with me</i>
<i>with the prospect of marriage?</i>

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,114
HALF A YEAR LATER

17
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,582
Please.

18
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,987
It's too formal, Kitami.

19
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,021
Really?

20
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,157
"The prospect of marriage"? It's too much.

21
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,426
Let's just keep this as
a birthday celebration.

22
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:02,196
No, when it comes to things like this,
someone has to force it through.

23
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,231
Just do the proposal
the way I told you to.

24
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,433
What do I say?

25
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,435
You should probably
clean this place up first.

26
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,670
I already did.

27
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,873
Besides, you should practice with
Governor Akatsuka and not me.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,775
I can't practice with a woman.

29
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,410
I don't particularly enjoy this either.

30
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,311
Right.

31
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,413
Sorry for asking so much.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,549
I was just roped into this
by Governor Akatsuka.

33
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,851
You're going back
to the Ministry soon, right?

34
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:27,121
Until then, I plan to keep you on
as our spy.

35
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:32,526
Anyway, have you found a new second doctor
to replace Dr. Otowa?

36
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,230
Not yet.

37
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,065
What are you going to do?

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,369
Are you planning to make Dr. Hina
your second doctor after her residency?

39
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,406
What does she think?

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,408
I haven't talked to her about it.

41
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,844
It's just that Dr. Takanawa said that

42
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,214
she's sure Dr. Hina will become
an excellent cardiac surgeon.

43
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,088
Dr. Takanawa. The results
of the echocardiogram are good,

44
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,124
and we found nothing on the X-rays either.

45
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,025
Kurumi.

46
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,929
If you keep this up,
we can discharge you next week.

47
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,365
That's amazing, Kurumi.

48
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,567
You'll be able to carry
the Omikoshi this year.

49
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:15,736
What's wrong?

50
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,974
She really likes Dr. Hina,

51
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,643
so she's sad that
she'll have to say goodbye.

52
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,383
You know,

53
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,754
I'll be really happy once you get
well enough to leave the hospital.

54
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,357
We can see each other anytime.

55
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,798
He's proposing?!

56
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,868
Chief Kitami is proposing to Dr. Takanawa?

57
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,604
Apparently, Governor Akatsuka
is pushing him to do it.

58
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,674
But they got divorced once, right?

59
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,409
Do you think Dr. Takanawa wants to?

60
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,379
I don't think it bothers her that much.

61
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,682
I'm sure she has an idea that he wants to.

62
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,185
Isn't it fine?

63
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,856
After all, Dr. Takanawa is
the one who's held him up

64
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,458
ever since Ms. Suzuka passed away.

65
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,229
How do you know
so much about them, Ms. Natsumi?

66
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,998
Chief Kitami asked me
to find out whatever I could

67
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,367
about how she feels about him.

68
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,603
We're not in middle school anymore.

69
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,439
Chief Kitami doesn't seem like the type
to do well at that sort of thing.

70
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,676
<i>Risk Management Control.</i>

71
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,512
<i>The special effects system at</i>
<i>a theater in Koto City has exploded.</i>

72
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,980
<i>Injuries confirmed.</i>

73
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,450
<i>It's a small-scale medical incident.</i>
<i>Requesting Tokyo MER.</i>

74
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:37,818
Dr. Hina.

75
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,121
Copy that. On our way.

76
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,660
This is Takanawa.

77
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,728
It's Kitami.

78
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,630
<i>I know. A dispatch, right?</i>

79
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:50,998
<i>Dr. Hina already went.</i>

80
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:51,899
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,867
Oh, and happy birthday.

82
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,673
He hasn't changed.

83
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,511
<i>Eight confirmed injuries.</i>
<i>Some appear to be serious.</i>

84

<i>Panicked audience members</i>
<i>have fallen on the stairs,</i>

<i>leading to additional injuries.</i>
<i>Rescue operations are ongoing.</i>

86

<i>to mid-scale, risk level increased.</i>

<i>Request for assistance has</i>
<i>been issued to nearby hospitals.</i>

88
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,624
MER, copy. We're almost there.

89

<i>The lights have been damaged</i>
<i>by the explosion.</i>

90
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,901
<i>Rescue work in the building is slow</i>
<i>due to there only being emergency lights</i>

91
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,803
<i>to prevent fire from electrical leaks.</i>

92
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,107
Dr. Fuyuki, Ms. Natsume and Mr. Tokumaru.

93
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,843
Take care of transport and treatment
of patients outside.

94
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,478
I will take care of
the patients still inside.

95
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,213
-Ms. Minh, come with me.
-Yes.

96
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,180
Let's go.

97
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,216
It's the MER!

98
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,450
I'm going to examine you.

99
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,585
Are you okay?

100
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,687
-It's the MER.
-<i>Number injured is increasing.</i>

101
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,421
<i>What's happened?</i>

102
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,990
TO1 has made it to the scene
and are attending to the patients.

103
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,759
Dr. Tsurumaki is acting as chief.

104
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,229
Chief Kitami and Dr. Otowa
are approaching the scene as well.

105
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,165
With the increased number of injuries,
the scale has been raised.

106
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:02,503
It's the first time for Dr. Tsurumaki
to handle a mid-scale incident alone.

107
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,640
<i>Are you okay, Dr. Hina?</i>

108
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,642
<i>I'm fine. Bring the patients to TO1.</i>

109
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,910
What happened?

110
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,279
We have no footage. We don't know.

111
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,950
Female in her 30s. Resuscitated from
cardiac arrest due to abdominal wound.

112
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,952
We will operate on
the patient's abdomen to remove

113
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,188
the protruding object and repair
the damaged blood vessels.

114
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,559
Dr. Fuyuki.
Insert v-sheath from internal jugular.

115
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,895
Ms. Natsume, prepare
a laparotomy set with two suction tubes.

116
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,397
Mr. Tokumaru, bring
the stretcher to the building's entrance.

117
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,765
Take care of her.

118
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,334
Dr. Hina, you're wounded.

119
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,869
The lighting fell down
while she was giving first aid.

120
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,805
I'm fine, let's go.

121
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,576
She needs emergency surgery.
Moving her to Risk Management Control.

122
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,178
Dr. Tsurumaki has injured her arm.

123
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,646
<i>Any doctors who can respond?</i>

124
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,781
Reinforcements are not here yet.
Prioritize transport.

125
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,284
That will take too long.
We're taking her to TO1.

126
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,618
<i>We're inside.</i>

127
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,558
Straight ahead.

128
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,396
Just stopping the bleeding is fine.

129
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,397
Okay.

130
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,432
<i>Dr. Tsurumaki. Can you do this?</i>

131
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,104
Dr. Hina. You can't do it
with your arm like that.

132
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,840
<i>Dr. Hina. It's a difficult operation.</i>

133
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,543
Just block the aorta with a catheter
and proceed with transportation.

134
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,145
<i>Dr. Tsurumaki.</i>

135
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,848
There's already massive hemorrhaging
inside the abdominal cavity.

136
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,217
She could go into cardiac arrest
during transportation.

137
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,586
I have to do this.

138
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,094
TO1 open.

139
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,999
A v-sheath has been placed
in the right jugular vein.

140
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,267
I'll take over the stabilization.

141
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,871
I'll make a trauma incision
to perform open abdominal surgery.

142
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:44,772
Scalpel.

143
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,639
Scalpel.

144
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,289
-Ms. Minh, suction please.
-Yes.

145
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,793
-Blood pressure has dropped to 76.
-Retractor.

146
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,261
-Gauze.
-Gauze.

147
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,495
Doing a hemostasis on mesentery.

148
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:09,763
-Tweezers.
-Tweezers.

149
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,404
-Mosquito forceps.
-Mosquito forceps.

150
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,415
Hemostasis complete.
Remove it slowly, Ms. Minh.

151
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,683
Yes, I will remove it.

152
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,351
I will follow up.

153
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,487
It's been removed.

154
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,955
-I'll take it.
-Thank you.

155
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,726
Bleeding is increasing.

156
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,494
Suction.

157
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,035
It has reached the abdominal aorta.

158
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,571
Blood pressure has dropped to 68/36.

159
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,440
-Blood loss has exceeded 4000.
-Ms. Minh, perform compression hemostasis.

160
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,541
Yes.

161
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,411
Mattox Maneuver to excise
the left parietal peritoneum.

162
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,279
Then open and repair the aorta.

163
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,447
-Electric scalpel?
-Electric scalpel.

164
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,485
Dr. Hina.

165
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,019
I'm fine.

166
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,657
Mr. Tokumaru, O plus packed cells
and AB plus FFP, twenty units each.

167
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,425
Got it.

168
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,194
Dr. Hina. She's bleeding
from around the v-sheath.

169
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,064
-Two units of calcium gluconate.
-Got it.

170
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,499
Mr. Tokumaru. Turn up the warm saline.

171
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,233
Got it.

172
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,534
Ms. Minh, lift here.

173
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,369
More to the right.

174
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,940
-Blood pressure dropped to 56/30.
-Blood loss is 5000.

175
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,408
Performing hemostasis on the aorta.

176
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,610
Kelly clamp.

177
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,320
Dr. Hina.

178
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,423
Kelly clamp.

179
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,527
Kelly clamp.

180
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,289
I'll take it from here.

181
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,090
Chief Kitami.

182
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,158
Dr. Fuyuki.

183
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,295
Circulation is compromised
due to severe abdominal hemorrhage.

184
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,430
It's an injury to the aorta
below the renal artery.

185
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,833
Right. I will block and repair the aorta
just below the diaphragm.

186
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,036
Dr. Otowa, dissect and block
the distal part of the injury.

187
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,738
Dr. Fuyuki and Ms. Minh,
continue the transfusion protocol.

188
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,141
Tokumaru, use the Cell Saver
to return the blood.

189
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,577
Ms. Natsume,
prepare continuous 3-0 Prolene.

190
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,478
Electric scalpel. Thanks.

191
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,949
Starting the dissection. Satinsky.

192
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,250
Periphery blocked.

193
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,718
Got it. Please bend it more.

194
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,787
-Cauterizing it.
-Please do.

195
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,289
Stitching now with 3-0.

196
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,091
I'll assist with the thread. Forceps.

197
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,225
Please proceed.

198
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,562
Stitched. Let's remove the Satinsky.

199
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,864
On three, slowly.

200
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,232
One, two, three.

201
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,069
Released.

202
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,537
The bleeding has stopped.

203
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,439
Blood pressure, 82/58.

204
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,940
Still rising.

205
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,676
Let's apply an incised drape
and temporarily close for transport.

206
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,677
Yes.

207
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,917
All rescue and transport
of the injured are complete.

208
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,988
For this dispatch,
15 minor injuries, three serious.

209
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,089
And casualties…

210
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,156
CASUALTIES: 0

211
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,024
Zero!

212
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:32,699
For Dr. Tsurumaki to get injured just as
Dr. Otowa is leaving is problematic.

213
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,304
That Ministry of Health geezer
will be on our case.

214
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,907
If we hadn't arrived,
the patient would have died.

215
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,077
Did you not think
to block the aorta and transfer her

216
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,781
when you have an injury that made it
impossible for you to operate?

217
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,716
It's my responsibility.

218
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:55,122
I should have properly checked Dr. Hina's
condition and insisted more strongly.

219
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:56,857
No.

220
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,394
As the doctor in charge of the scene,

221
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,896
I judged that
I could perform the hemostasis.

222
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:06,400
But you couldn't handle the injury
to the abdominal aorta.

223
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,106
The old Dr. Hina
would have given up from the start.

224
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,476
Now, she is
courageously trying to save patients.

225
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,680
Reckless courage without skill
is most dangerous.

226
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,981
Saying it like that is…

227
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,051
Dr. Hina's efforts saved the patient.

228
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:28,689
Chief Kitami, what do you think
about Dr. Hina's decision?

229
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,937
The inability to control blood loss
upon opening the aorta was foreseeable,

230
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,640
considering the amount of blood suctioned
and the case's progress.

231
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,678
A doctor in charge of the scene
cannot overlook this.

232
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:57,284
Insisting on operating with an injured arm
was an error in judgment by Dr. Hina.

233
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,328
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,897
Once you finish your residency,

235
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,400
you should pursue
cardiovascular surgery, Dr. Hina.

236
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,238
This is my last piece of advice
before leaving the team.

237
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,427
It is crucial for doctors
responding to accidents or disasters

238
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,462
that they avoid
involvement in secondary disasters.

239
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,866
Moreover, Dr. Tsurumaki attempted to
operate with an injured arm.

240
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,201
She put the patient's life at risk.

241
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,938
Dr. Kitami, what are
your thoughts on this situation?

242
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,542
Everything is
my responsibility as the team leader.

243
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,645
I apologize for causing all this trouble.

244
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:02,783
Dr. Tsurumaki could have lost her life.

245
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,253
We can't lend any more residents

246
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,990
to a team involved in
such dangerous medical activities.

247
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,861
Dr. Tsurumaki's initial residency
is about to end, right?

248
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,030
Yes.

249
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:22,769
Is your intention still
to specialize in cardiovascular surgery?

250
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:31,278
I want to continue
studying cardiovascular surgery

251
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,981
under Dr. Takanawa. That has not changed.

252
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,052
Understood. Also, Dr. Kitami.

253
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,857
Dr. Otowa will soon leave the team

254
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,827
to focus on
his MER supervisory role, correct?

255
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,096
Right. We need to
decide on a new second doctor.

256
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,464
What are your plans?

257
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,371
Does anyone here
want to be my second doctor?

258
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,413
Our hospital has never had
the luxury of surplus staff.

259
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,182
If you are unable to establish
a proper medical system,

260
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,718
it might be better to
consult Governor Akatsuka

261
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,054
and transfer you to a university hospital.

262
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,858
Wait a minute.
If that happens, the current team…

263
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,427
They are originally our medical staff.

264
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,162
The current team will be dissolved,

265
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:26,266
and we will have to
gather new staff at the next institution.

266
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,077
Minister Kamata whom you're about to meet

267
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,747
is no less tricky
than the former Minister Shirokane.

268
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,250
Don't fall for any traps he might set.

269
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,953
Do you dislike this Minister Kamata?

270
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,989
I don't dislike him.

271
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,757
I hate him.

272
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,027
He's a greedy old man
who only thinks about money.

273
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,130
The Ministry of Health plans to
deploy MERs to all major cities,

274
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:02,702
and not only the Tokyo MER
directly under the Metropolitan Governor.

275
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,505
This plan is finally starting.
You're aware of that, aren't you?

276
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,274
Yes, of course.

277
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,175
I am worried though.

278
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:16,316
It must worry you quite a bit that
Otowa's replacement hasn't been found yet.

279
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,618
Thank you for your concern.

280
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,787
The reason I called you today

281
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:24,357
is to introduce
a talented individual from the Ministry

282
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,027
to help save the crisis at Tokyo MER.

283
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,228
Aoto.

284
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,003
I am Tatsuya Aoto from the Ministry
of Health, Labour and Welfare.

285
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,939
Aoto is one of my subordinates.

286
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,309
Like Otowa, he is a medical official
with a medical license.

287
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,978
How about considering him
for the second doctor role?

288
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:49,015
Of course, the decision is up to
Governor Akatsuka and Mr. Kitami.

289
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,586
We appreciate the kind offer,

290
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,689
but doesn't being a medical official mean

291
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,458
you have been away from
practical medicine for a while?

292
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,993
Rest assured.

293
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,463
Until eight years ago,
I was a practicing doctor in a hospital.

294
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,465
Eight years ago?

295
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,602
After joining here, I've participated
in medical support during disasters,

296
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,637
and above all,

297
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,908
if Otowa could do it, so can I.

298
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,483
Excuse me for being blunt,
but why did you get a medical license?

299
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:27,988
Of course,

300
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,924
it's because
I want to save people's lives.

301
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:33,693
I see.

302
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,430
In that case, could you help me
as my support doctor?

303
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,099
Kitami!

304
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,001
I look forward to
working with you, Chief Kitami.

305
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,036
I look forward to
working with you too, Dr. Aoto.

306
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,141
I'm glad to have been of help.

307
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:52,212
Now, Aoto, please discuss
future plans with Chief Kitami.

308
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,582
I will do my best to
meet your expectations, Minister Kamata.

309
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,751
-Let us go.
-Excuse us.

310
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,121
Excuse us.

311
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,724
Why Mr. Aoto?

312
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,292
I know what you want to say.

313
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,996
He graduated from a third-rate university,
was useless in the hospital,

314
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,166
and used his parents' connections
to flee here. He's a complete dud.

315
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,803
His parents lost the last election,
so now he can't use them anymore.

316
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,704
So why…

317
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,773
It's precisely because he is a dud.

318
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,544
You are hoping that Mr. Aoto will fail?

319
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,749
Before expanding MER nationwide,

320
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:33,653
Minister Kamata intends to dismantle
the Tokyo MER under the governor.

321
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,159
Then, the Ministry of Health can rebuild
the entire MER system from scratch.

322
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,063
You will have free rein
over the national MER network.

323
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:49,302
Mr. Kugayama. Have you completed
the list of medical equipment makers

324
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,572
who will be involved in
the national MER expansion plan?

325
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,541
Here it is.

326
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,376
What is the number?

327
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,278
It's 10%.

328
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,146
You sure are competent.

329
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,918
Ms. Shirokane was right
in recognizing your talent.

330
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,019
Thank you.

331
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,021
Are you changing suppliers?

332
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,357
The current ones are well-versed
in MER operations and have expertise.

333
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,527
Long-term relationships can get too cozy.

334
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,962
We need fresh blood.

335
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,899
<i>I wasn't informed about this change.</i>

336
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,935
It's the minister's decision.

337
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,204
We will gain nothing from changing.

338
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,640
With the existing know-how, we can
produce ER cars suited for emergencies.

339
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,242
You are so naive.

340
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:31,978
You know, don't you?

341
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,850
New entrants will donate 10% of profits

342
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,219
as a rebate
to Minister Kamata's political group.

343
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,754
Will you leak it to the media?

344
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,826
The expansion of MER will stall,
and you as supervisor will be out too.

345
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,630
You can't realize ideals with empty words.

346
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,833
As a bureaucrat, one must navigate
both the clear and murky waters.

347
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,006
Thank you so much for everything.

348
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,876
This is the address of our restaurant.

349
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,545
If you're ever in the neighborhood,
please come and eat.

350
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,213
It's on the house.

351
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,882
Thank you very much.

352
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,184
Is it named after Kurumi?

353
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,620
It's in Asakusa, I see.

354
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,587
I'll make sure to come by.

355
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,389
Thank you so much.

356
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,691
Dr. Hina, this is for you.

357
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,127
THANK YOU, DR. HINA
KURUMI

358
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,929
Thank you.

359
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,732
I'll treasure this.

360
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,436
Bye-bye, Dr. Hina.

361
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,504
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

362
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,643
You made the right choice
to stay in cardiovascular surgery.

363
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,544
Huh?

364
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,714
I know that you worked hard in the MER,

365
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,384
and what you learned there
won't be wasted.

366
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,420
You can use that
as a cardiovascular surgeon.

367
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,059
You're right.

368
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,301
I have officially become
a member of Tokyo MER from today.

369
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,802
I am Tatsuya Aoto.

370
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,572
Although I've been
away from the medical field for a while,

371
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:09,475
the skills and knowledge I learned
during my days with patients

372
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,211
are not easily forgotten.

373
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,480
I look forward to
saving many lives with you all.

374
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:15,882
Thank you very much.

375
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,456
And now, our new official member Dr. Aoto,

376
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:27,227
if you would please proceed with
the locker naming ceremony.

377
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,096
AOTO

378
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,766
Thank you.

379
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,568
Dr. Aoto.

380
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,837
-It's great that he's a cheerful person.
-Yes.

381
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,339
I heard he was a medical official,

382
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,808
so I worried
he'd be difficult like Dr. Otowa.

383
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,010
Ah, sorry.

384
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,812
Are you the intern, Ms. Hina Tsurumaki?

385
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,380
Yes.

386
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,850
I heard you're graduating from MER
to join cardiovascular surgery.

387
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,751
Good job.

388
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,788
It must have been tough.

389
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,458
Even though you're an intern
unfamiliar with everything,

390
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,094
you engaged yourself
in such a high-risk field of medicine.

391
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,631
It reminds me of my days as an intern.

392
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:12,038
I would choose cardiovascular surgery
over such a dangerous job, too.

393
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,943
What has been going on so far?

394
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,544
-Chief Kitami.
-Yes.

395
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,648
Are you sure about
letting Dr. Hina go like this?

396
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,618
The entire hospital expects her to
go to cardiovascular surgery.

397
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,621
If you're going to stop it,
now's the time.

398
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,961
Dr. Aoto, I'll show you
the materials in the staff room.

399
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:35,862
Please.

400
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,332
Syringe pumps are on both sides,
and for infusions…

401
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,533
He ran away.

402
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:44,037
Well, it's her decision,

403
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:48,875
and we should continue to work together
as a team for our patients.

404
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:50,910
Okay.

405
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:51,911
Huh?

406
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,256
Dr. Otowa.

407
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,557
Thank you for your hard work.

408
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,159
You too.

409
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,433
What is it? If you have something to say,
please say it quickly.

410
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,841
Originally…

411
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:27,046
my dream was to become
a cardiac surgeon just like Dr. Takanawa.

412
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:33,052
<i>I really hated being assigned</i>
<i>to MER just to fill numbers.</i>

413
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,122
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>doctors had to work in dangerous places.</i>

414
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,590
<i>It baffled me.</i>

415
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,993
I can't, I'm an intern.
I might make a mistake again.

416
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,128
Stop making excuses!

417
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,064
You're a doctor. Save these people.

418
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,602
<i>But I learned that some lives</i>
<i>could not be saved if I just waited.</i>

419
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,109
<i>I felt that maybe</i>
<i>even I could do something.</i>

420
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,144
I'm glad you were there.

421
00:22:58,745 --> 00:22:59,645
Thank you.

422
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,217
While experiencing
the field with everyone,

423
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,720
<i>I began to take pride in my work at MER.</i>

424
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,357
<i>I thought I wanted to…</i>

425
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,595
<i>continue working with everyone at MER.</i>

426
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,765
But…

427
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,770
the more I learned about the field,
the more scared I became.

428
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,806
If I stayed,

429
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,910
I would eventually
become the second doctor

430
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,448
and support Dr. Kitami.

431
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:40,920
But I just couldn't imagine
myself replacing you, Dr. Otowa.

432
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:46,492
In other words, you're in doubt?

433
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,401
Is it…

434
00:23:56,636 --> 00:24:00,206
impossible for me
to be MER's second doctor?

435
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,112
I don't know what answer you're seeking,

436
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,382
but the job cannot go to
someone who lacks confidence.

437
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,584
In this field,

438
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,821
if a doctor hesitates for even a moment,
it can cost the life of a patient.

439
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,797
<i>Risk Management Control.</i>

440
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:28,301
<i>A houseboat has collided with a water bus</i>
<i>on the Sumida River.</i>

441
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:31,537
<i>There's a fire in the houseboat's kitchen</i>
<i>with multiple reported injured.</i>

442
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:35,241
<i>It's a large-scale medical emergency.</i>
<i>Requesting Tokyo MER.</i>

443
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,976
Copy that. On our way.

444
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:40,780
Ms. Natsume, Ms. Minh. Prep suture sets
in case of trauma and airway injuries.

445
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,949
Bring extra oxygen
and warm saline solution.

446
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:46,686
Dr. Fuyuki and Tokumaru,
set up the OR in case of emergency.

447
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,021
We'll bring
extra tools and blood for transfusions.

448
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,122
Large-scale medical emergency?

449
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,658
Dr. Aoto,
let's bring extra intubation sets.

450
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,460
Oh, right. Uh…

451
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:55,361
-Here.
-Oh.

452
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,699
I'll go too.

453
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,702
Your arm hasn't healed yet.
Stay at the hospital.

454
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,170
-Let's go.
-Yes!

455
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:16,048
<i>The houseboat's engine is still running,</i>
<i>heading towards the estuary.</i>

456
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,584
<i>It has passed Komagata Bridge,</i>
<i>moving towards Kuramae Bridge.</i>

457
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:22,421
<i>According to the crew,</i>
<i>the steering room is damaged by the fire.</i>

458
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,891
<i>The boat is out of control</i>
<i>and running wild.</i>

459
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,059
Copy that. We'll head farther downstream.

460
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,729
We'll go ahead to
Ryogoku Bridge to check first.

461
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,863
Status on rescue operation?

462
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,934
<i>Fire boats dispatched from the harbor</i>
<i>and Nihonbashi Fire Station.</i>

463
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,169
The firefighters seem to have
extinguished the fire.

464
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:41,007
However, it is challenging to
rescue passengers from the moving boat.

465
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,044
I'll go check it out.

466
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,025
This is Kitami.
Boat spotted near Ryogoku Bridge.

467
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,060
What's the status inside?

468
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:05,064
<i>Details are still unclear, but there are</i>
<i>45 passengers and crew members.</i>

469
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,767
<i>The captain is injured</i>
<i>and in critical condition, unconscious.</i>

470
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,770
<i>The combination of low tide</i>
<i>and last night's heavy rain upstream</i>

471
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,204
<i>caused the boat's speed to increase.</i>

472
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,073
<i>Many passengers are panicking outside.</i>

473
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,977
<i>The rescue boats cannot dock alongside</i>
<i>so rescue efforts are not proceeding.</i>

474
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:27,320
Hey! Hey, are we going to crash?

475
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,891
Mr. Komaba.
It'll hit the bridge girder at this rate.

476
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:32,959
Where are the rescue boats?!

477
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,760
They can't dock.
We can't get to them in time!

478
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,631
Hurry!

479
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,735
Chief Kitami,
the boat is likely to break and sink.

480
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,205
Prepare medical teams anticipating
several water rescue victims.

481
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,139
Got it.

482
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,710
People pulled from the river will be
treated at the base of Ryogoku Bridge.

483
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,981
Urgently select a first aid space
and call for reinforcements.

484
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,115
Wait.

485
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,155
Mr. Senju.

486
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,957
This is Senju from the Rescue Squad.

487
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,961
We'll board the houseboat and
attempt to prevent a collision by towing.

488
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,664
Don't lean out!

489
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,467
Don't jump off the boat!
You could be run over!

490
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,668
Help us!

491
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,437
-Clear to board!
-Boarding!

492
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,539
-Coming through!
-You'll be okay!

493
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,408
We are the rescue squad. You're safe now.

494
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,443
Hurry up and help us!

495
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,513
We'll control the ship first.
Secure the bow with ropes.

496
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,714
Tow with the fireboat.

497
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,749
Roger!

498
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,050
Got it!

499
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,885
Sending throw bag!

500
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,188
Throw bag received!

501
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,558
Everything's okay now.

502
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,794
Hurry, the bridge is close!

503
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,196
It's tied!

504
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,731
<i>Connection made! Starting to tow the boat!</i>

505
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:46,699
Got it!

506
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,701
The current is good.

507
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,547
It's going to be a bit shaky.

508
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,695
This is Senju.
We're passing Ryogoku Bridge.

509
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,035
This is Kitami. Chasing the ship
with TO1, heading downstream.

510
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,904
Please direct us to the rendezvous point.

511
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,805
<i>Okay.</i>

512
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,406
We're the rescue squad.

513
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:28,974
We will get you out of here.

514
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,078
Please move to the front of the boat
so everyone can get off quickly.

515
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:35,815
Give them life jackets
and keep them from falling overboard.

516
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,716
Yes!

517
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,818
<i>Senju, what's the situation inside?</i>

518
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,088
It's full of smoke, low visibility.

519
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,456
The smoke is…

520
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,458
Still billowing
from the bottom of the ship.

521
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,127
Seems like there's
a fire at the bottom of the ship.

522
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,428
A fire at the bottom?

523
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,897
It's usually non-flammable,
so this shouldn't be happening.

524
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,700
<i>Perhaps something flammable</i>
<i>was left behind by mistake.</i>

525
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,905
Over ten people with visible injuries,
including burns and trauma.

526
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,876
The explosion occurred
in the rear kitchen.

527
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,312
Seems to have been caused
by a gas cylinder.

528
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,648
The wheelhouse next to it is damaged.
Steering is impossible.

529
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:10,916
<i>Can you stop the engine?</i>

530
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,852
Where is the engine room?

531
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,587
-Under the floor there.
-Thank you.

532
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,730
Do you have the key?

533
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,532
Only the captain knows where it is.

534
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,701
Captain, are you okay?

535
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,180
Stopping the engine may be difficult.

536
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,081
<i>And the fire?</i>

537
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:45,151
I think it started in
the engine room at the bottom,

538
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,952
but not sure we can extinguish it.

539
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:52,825
The only way is to flood it with water,
but that risks sinking the ship.

540
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,693
We have to evacuate the passengers first.

541
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,799
But the fuel tanks are down there.

542
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,233
Yes.

543
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,637
This ship will eventually explode.

544
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,149
We cannot dock a ship that won't stop.

545
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:21,687
Can you use the life and rescue boats
to evacuate the people on board?

546
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:22,788
We will!

547
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,192
The evacuation point will be
the Hakozaki Disaster Prevention Pier.

548
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:29,261
Coordinate with fire station and police
and have emergency vehicles on standby.

549
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,162
Roger!

550
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:34,600
Oh my. This is a serious situation.

551
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,168
Minister Kamata.

552
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,872
I've come to observe with
the nationwide deployment of MER in mind.

553
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,307
Please don't mind me.

554
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,544
Where's the dud?

555
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,846
He has been dispatched.

556
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:50,316
This will be a sight to behold.

557
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,955
The next person can change boats, slowly.

558
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59,792
<i>Mr. Senju, this is Kitami.</i>

559
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,061
Can you send us footage
from inside the ship?

560
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,430
It's an emergency,
so we'll triage using the video.

561
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,365
-Got it.
<i>-Sharing the footage.</i>

562
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,133
Thank you.

563
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,471
The woman in yellow clothes by the wall,
how are her pulse and breathing?

564
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,039
Deformation and swelling
on the right knee.

565
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,509
She's conscious and breathing clearly,
but her pulse is weakening,

566
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,544
That would be a red tag.

567
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:21,080
If there's no external bleeding,
fix her leg with a splint

568
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,382
and elevate both legs a bit
when transporting her.

569
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,284
-Got it.
<i>-Next person, please.</i>

570
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,387
The patient lying down there
with soot on his face.

571
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,090
Charring on the face or airway
could mean thermal injury to the airway.

572
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:35,194
Elevate his upper body and be aware
of suffocation. Give him a yellow tag.

573
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,930
-Prepare more fluids for infusion.
-We'll add more splints as well.

574
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:41,934
The man who is holding his stomach,
are there any contusions on the abdomen?

575
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,235
<i>I'll lift here. Yes, there are.</i>

576
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,970
Please give him a yellow tag.

577
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,139
<i>Don't let him walk</i>
<i>as it might worsen the injury.</i>

578
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:48,741
A yellow tag.

579
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:52,745
She's panicking, so make her
take slow breaths and calm her down.

580
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,748
<i>A red tag. Check in on her periodically.</i>

581
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,449
Is the person next to her a friend?

582
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,119
Let them know to keep talking to her.

583
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,221
<i>This is the captain.</i>

584
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,789
Can you check pulse and breathing?

585
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:05,391
Unresponsive with an injury on his head,

586
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,794
laceration from right ear to neck
and heavy bleeding from the nose.

587
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:12,998
<i>-Pulse and breathing is weakening.</i>
-That's a critical condition, a red tag.

588
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:15,467
Please prioritize
transporting the captain first.

589
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,137
We'll operate on the head injury at TO1.

590
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,039
<i>Protect his spine during transport.</i>

591
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:20,940
Got it.

592
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,775
Next one, please.

593
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,043
Mr. Senju!

594
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,412
Show us the parent and child.

595
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,186
Ms. Natsume, those two…

596
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,322
It's Kurumi and her mother?

597
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:39,925
<i>Do you know them?</i>

598
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:42,361
<i>Kurumi is a patient of Dr. Takanawa.</i>

599
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:45,264
She has pulmonary atresia
and a ventricular defect.

600
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,967
She had a Rastelli procedure
and was discharged recently.

601
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,068
Are they conscious?

602
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,603
The mother's name is Maki Kyobashi.

603
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,604
This is the rescue squad.

604
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,709
<i>Ms. Maki, Kurumi. Are you okay?</i>

605
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:00,412
<i>Ms. Maki. Ms. Maki, are you okay?</i>

606
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,281
<i>My daughter…</i>

607
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,118
<i>Ms. Maki. Ms. Maki!</i>

608
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,954
This is Tsurumaki. Please share
the video of Kurumi to the staff room.

609
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,055
<i>I'm sharing it.</i>

610
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,526
Mr. Senju, is there
any bleeding in the chest area?

611
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,664
<i>There's bleeding.</i>

612
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,032
Don't move her!

613
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,702
She may be bleeding
from the artificial blood vessel.

614
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,804
Dr. Hina, where is Dr. Takanawa?

615
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:27,573
She's in surgery.

616
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,708
Can you bring a wire twister here?

617
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,877
I'm on my way.

618
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:34,947
What should we do?

619
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,449
<i>Don't move them.</i>
<i>The vascular laceration could worsen.</i>

620
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,719
The mother has
a severe head injury and is unconscious.

621
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:43,722
A spinal cord injury could lead to
paralysis or respiratory arrest,

622
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:44,890
<i>so keep her still.</i>

623
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,725
But if we do nothing…

624
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,494
I'll go there.

625
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,698
What are you saying?
It's going to explode.

626
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,000
-Chief Kitami.
-I have to go to save them.

627
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,913
Bring Chief Kitami to the boat.

628
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,850
Senju, secure an emergency lifeboat
to Hakozaki Disaster Prevention Pier.

629
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:12,751
<i>Roger!</i>

630
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,787
I'll head to the houseboat when we arrive.

631
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:18,223
Ms. Minh and Dr. Aoto,
transport the captain to TO1.

632
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,360
Dr. Otowa and Dr. Aoto,
proceed with the surgery on his head.

633
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,694
Ms. Natsume, prep the tools.

634
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,363
Dr. Fuyuki, prepare for
general anesthesia.

635
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,066
-Tokumaru, standby on SL1.
<i>-Understood.</i>

636
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,035
Dr. Otowa, I leave the rest to you.

637
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,740
<i>MER has arrived at Hakozaki.</i>

638
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,181
-Dr. Aoto, please start from the bottom.
-Yes.

639
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,684
Take the children to the shore first…

640
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,519
Ma'am, wait a moment please.

641
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,823
It's scary, but you'll be fine.

642
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,691
Dr. Kitami, over here!

643
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,859
Mr. Tatsumi.

644
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,665
He's on board. Stern okay, bow okay.

645
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,500
Setting off.

646
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,202
The captain is here.

647
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,203
Yes.

648
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,171
One, two, three. Please.

649
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,139
Yes.

650
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,675
Are you okay?

651
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:10,676
Are you okay?

652
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,578
-What happened?
-Are you okay?

653
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:19,351
Dr. Otowa, another patient
aside from the captain

654
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,620
might have a chest trauma.

655
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,755
He has contusions
on the left anterior chest.

656
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,959
He's barely conscious,
showing signs of shock.

657
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,128
<i>Understood. I'll head to the medical tent.</i>

658
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,197
Please bring this patient
to the medical tent.

659
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,198
Yes. Please!

660
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,235
<i>Dr. Aoto, transport the captain to TO1.</i>

661
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,638
Please!

662
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:41,907
Got it.

663
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,014
Take my hand!

664
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,785
-Where is Kurumi and her mom?
-This way.

665
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,088
We evacuated everybody else.

666
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,190
Mr. Minato, Mr. Kosuge, give them oxygen.

667
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,224
Yes!

668
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,561
I'm Dr. Kitami, can you hear me?

669
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,196
Kurumi, can you hear me?

670
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:07,065
Ma'am! Ms. Maki, can you hear me?

671
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,067
I'm leaning in here.

672
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,169
What's the situation?

673
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,038
Kurumi might have
bleeding around the heart.

674
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:16,375
The mother may have respiratory issues
due to suspected spinal injury,

675
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,810
so I'll intubate her here
and protect the spine during transport.

676
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:19,811
I'll help. Instruct me.

677
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,147
Okay. Please attach the monitor.

678
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,283
Hang in there, Kurumi.

679
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,018
Let's do this together.

680
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,460
Dr. Otowa, there's an arrhythmia.

681
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,296
Blood pressure, 76/42.

682
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,197
<i>Otowa.</i>

683
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:40,599
Surgery prep is ready in TO1,
come back immediately.

684
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,167
I can't leave now.

685
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,870
<i>-Ligate the facial arteries.</i>
-But--

686
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:48,707
Right now, you're the only one
who can save the patient.

687
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,118
TO1 open.

688
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:13,932
We will now begin the surgery
for the head and neck injury.

689
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,236
-Dr. Fuyuki. General anesthesia.
-Yes.

690
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,304
-Ms. Natsume, tools.
-Yes.

691
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,873
Mr. Tokumaru, prep the electric scalpel.

692
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,941
Yes.

693
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:27,846
Governor Akatsuka, is it really okay
to make Aoto the lead surgeon?

694
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,781
It's an emergency, we have no choice.

695
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:33,652
He's been away from
practical medicine for so long,

696
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,387
I don't agree with it.

697
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:38,924
If anything happens, it's not on me.

698
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,160
As long as Tokyo MER is
under the governor's direct control,

699
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,263
I take full responsibility.

700
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,402
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

701
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,110
Dr. Aoto, here's the gauze.

702
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:04,049
You'll need suction, right?

703
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,584
Yes.

704
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,756
Can you control the bleeding?

705
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,458
It's hard to see.

706
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,595
Should we expand the other side?

707
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:17,929
Please do.

708
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,703
Blood pressure dropped to 60/42.

709
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,277
Applying pressure to control bleeding.

710
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,679
Preparing the Cell Saver.

711
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,950
Dr. Aoto, please identify
the source of the bleeding.

712
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:40,919
I know.

713
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:46,124
He's even more of a dud than I imagined.

714
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:47,592
Yes.

715
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,963
Dr. Aoto, the source of bleeding?

716
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,967
Blood pressure dropping further, 54/38.

717
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:00,939
Dr. Aoto.

718
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,921
Dr. Aoto!

719
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,759
I can't do it.

720
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,861
This is too much too soon.

721
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,330
I can't do this!

722
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:32,671
Identify the source of bleeding
and control the artery!

723
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:36,174
You are a doctor, only you can do it!

724
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,247
Dr. Aoto!

725
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,789
Electric scalpel.

726
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,288
I'll take it from here.

727
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,596
It's from
the external carotid artery system.

728
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,099
Severe hemorrhagic shock
with a risk of cardiac arrest.

729
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,302
I'll ligate the external carotid
through a right submandibular incision.

730
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,637
I'll assist with suction.

731
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,138
Thank you. Mr. Tokumaru,

732
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,441
warm the transfusion with SL1
and switch to rapid infusion.

733
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,409
Dr. Fuyuki, can you maintain circulation?

734
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,278
-I'll correct the coagulation as well.
-Thank you.

735
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,181
-Artery visible, need a hemostatic clip.
-Here.

736
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:50,949
Got it.

737
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,252
Ligated. What's the blood pressure?

738
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,321
72/50, it's rising.

739
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,957
Let's ligate
the facial artery peripherally.

740
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,425
Ms. Natsume, mosquito clamp.

741
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,360
<i>-3-0 silk suture.</i>
<i>-3-0.</i>

742
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,798
Blood pressure rising further,
stable at 84/56.

743
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:15,207
This is Kitami.
The mother's condition is stable.

744
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,309
<i>The smoke is getting thicker,</i>
<i>evacuate immediately.</i>

745
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,212
We can't move Kurumi
until we stop the bleeding.

746
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,713
This will be a bit cold.

747
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,082
Where are you right now, Dr. Hina?

748
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,650
I've joined TO1.

749
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:26,785
Okay.

750
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:29,321
Kurumi has bleeding in the pericardium.

751
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,423
I will have to open her chest here.

752
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:35,026
I need the wire twister.
And portable oxygen.

753
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:38,463
Can we have them drop supplies
from the bridge ahead towards the ship?

754
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,598
We will catch it.

755
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,501
Komaba here, setting Toyomi Ohashi Bridge
as the handover point.

756
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:43,668
Sharing the location.

757
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,837
TOYOMI OHASHI BRIDGE

758
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,041
We'll be okay here,
so please go, Dr. Hina.

759
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:51,843
Yes.

760
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,179
We've got the emergency TO3
ready for transport.

761
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:55,080
Then I'll go!

762
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:58,550
I'm good with motorcycles.

763
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,019
Please.

764
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:05,257
<i>The boat passed Kachidoki Bridge,</i>
<i>emitting white smoke.</i>

765

Thank you.

766
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,709
This is Tsurumaki.
I've reached the bridge.

767
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,011
<i>Got it. Just stay and--</i>

768
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,015
Drop the tools to the emergency team.

769
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,283
What's happening?

770
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,984
She's seizing.

771
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,186
Ms. Maki. I'll have a look at your chest.

772
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,021
What's happening?

773
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:38,557
Ms. Maki is
cyanotic from cardiogenic shock.

774
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,160
This will be bright.

775
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,364
Monitor shows AV block.

776
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,966
Ms. Maki, keep fighting!

777
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,236
Kurumi! Kurumi…

778
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:56,441
What's happening to Kurumi?

779
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:58,710
Cardiac arrest.
Mr. Senju, please start CPR.

780
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,979
Kurumi. Kurumi, come back.

781
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,815
Kurumi, hang in there!

782
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,984
<i>Ms. Maki, Kurumi is fighting too.</i>

783
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,620
<i>-Kurumi, can you hear me?</i>
<i>-Check the monitor.</i>

784
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:09,688
<i>How is she?</i>

785
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,323
<i>She's not coming back.</i>

786
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,459
Dr. Tsurumaki, over here!

787
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:16,528
Throw it!

788
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,597
<i>Kurumi!</i>

789
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,566
Mr. Senju, I'm giving adrenaline.

790
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,137
Ms. Maki, you'll be
getting some medicine now.

791
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,440
<i>Come back together with Kurumi.</i>

792
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:29,808
<i>Come back now.</i>

793
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,844
-Ms. Maki!
-You'll be okay.

794
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,413
Kurumi, can you hear me?

795
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,084
Just a little more… hang in there.

796
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,752
<i>Keep fighting, Ms. Maki!</i>

797
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,387
Kurumi!

798
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:54,332
Dr. Hina!

799
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,734
<i>What happened?!</i>

800
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:59,638
Ms. Tsurumaki jumped off the bridge
onto the boat…

801
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,276
Is she okay?

802
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,879
Kurumi, it's almost over, hang in there.

803
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,115
You can do it.

804
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,092
Chief Kitami!

805
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,033
Dr. Hina.

806
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,701
Chief Kitami, Mr. Senju. Oxygen.

807
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:30,802
Thank you.

808
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:31,870
Breathe in.

809
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,472
Are you okay?

810
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:35,940
Yes.

811
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:39,344
-I'll take care of Kurumi.
-Dr. Hina, wear the life jacket.

812
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:42,047
-Mr. Minato, Mr. Kosuge, ambu.
-Yes.

813
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,150
<i>I'll perform open-chest</i>
<i>direct hemostasis and CPR.</i>

814
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:48,720
Let's focus on
the patient in front of us. Cooper.

815
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,655
<i>I'll open the sternum in one go.</i>

816
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,391
<i>Mr. Senju, please hold her down.</i>

817
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,661
<i>This might hurt a bit.</i>

818
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:58,930
-Inserted.
-Removing the wire.

819
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,000
Here, oxygen.

820
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:06,971
Wire removed.

821
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,307
She's bleeding from the artificial vessel.

822
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,575
I'll apply pressure and start CPR.

823
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,315
Come on, Kurumi. Hang in there.

824
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:20,919
Okay. Ambu, please.

825
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:22,821
Ms. Maki.

826
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,823
Fight, Kurumi. Come on.

827
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,124
Ms. Maki!

828
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,126
Block is gone. Blood pressure stable.

829
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:33,798
Her pulse is back.
What does the monitor say?

830
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:35,667
Blood pressure is back too.

831
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:40,972
You did so well, Kurumi.

832
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:43,708
You did great.

833
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:44,609
Mr. Senju.

834
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,010
<i>We can move them now.</i>

835
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,718
Prepare for evacuation,
ready the backboard.

836
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,520
-Roger!
-Please take the monitor.

837
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,123
This is Kitami.
Kurumi needs emergency surgery

838
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,692
for bleeding from the right ventricular
pulmonary artery duct.

839
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,961
I want to minimize transport time,

840
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:05,396
so TO1 needs to be on standby
at the riverbank.

841
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,199
This is TO1, transport of the captain
is complete, we can move.

842
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,603
Komaba here, the rendezvous point
will be at Sea Forest Waterway.

843
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:15,740
Transfer the patient to the rescue boat
off Odaiba and then to TO1.

844
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,441
Copy that.

845
00:46:16,508 --> 00:46:17,542
Copy that.

846
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:21,179
Governor, please request
cooperation from the Coast Guard.

847
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,181
There is a risk that
the houseboat might explode.

848
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,683
Tell them to temporarily
close the area near Odaiba.

849
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,852
They should already be on their way.

850
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,835
One, two, three.

851
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:44,903
Secure an evacuation route.

852
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:45,804
Yes, sir.

853
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,607
-Mr. Senju, guys, have oxygen.
-I'll help.

854
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:53,077
Forget about us,
just focus on the patients.

855
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:54,779
Please.

856
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:56,981
Dr. Hina, keep applying pressure
to the bleeding.

857
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,584
Make sure the tracheal tube
doesn't move during transport.

858
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,719
Yes. Hang in there, just a little longer.

859
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,088
<i>There's a risk of explosion.</i>

860
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,325
Rescue boats towing, ensure
a safe distance from the houseboat.

861
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:08,960
<i>Harumi, copy that.</i>

862
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,095
<i>This is the Coast Guard</i>
<i>patrol boat Yamabuki.</i>

863
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,699
<i>Maritime closure complete near Odaiba.</i>
<i>No ships in the vicinity.</i>

864
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:16,601
MER has arrived!

865
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,536
-The dock is this way.
-Yes.

866
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,306
The consecutive surgeries
cause a risk of droplet transmission.

867
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,741
-Please ensure thorough disinfection.
-Yes.

868
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,146
Dr. Aoto.

869
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,781
I'll handle the disinfection.

870
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,283
That is about all I can do.

871
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,520
Thank you, Dr. Aoto.

872
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:38,456
I'll take care of all the dirty work.
Please prepare for the next surgery.

873
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:42,527
Dr. Otowa, please
rest in preparation for the surgery.

874
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:50,969
Slowly, watch your step!

875
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,705
Dr. Fuyuki, prep for massive transfusion
under general anesthesia.

876
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,473
<i>-Got it.</i>
-Secure the patients!

877
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,275
Retreat at full speed.

878
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:14,158
Kitami!

879
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,593
Senju, respond!

880
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:20,732
<i>This is Senju.</i>

881
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,936
Everyone is safe.

882
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,841
One, two, three.

883
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:33,544
Keep giving her pure oxygen
and set IV drip to 200 per hour.

884
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,146
-Let's go.
-Yes.

885
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:36,147
You got her!

886
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,084
Mr. Senju!

887
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,754
Are you okay? I'll bring oxygen.

888
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,855
I'm fine, just go!

889
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,359
This is Kitami. We'll be there soon.

890
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,164
TO1 open.

891
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:56,968
-I will be waiting in the anteroom.
-Thank you.

892
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:00,038
I will perform a right ventricular
pulmonary artery duct repair.

893
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,339
This pediatric heart re-surgery

894
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,441
requires dissection of adhesions
near the coronary arteries.

895
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:05,243
It's our hardest operation thus far.

896
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,445
I know everyone is tired
from the consecutive surgeries,

897
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:09,314
but let's stay focused
and give it our all.

898
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,515
Yes.

899
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,750
Dr. Hina is more familiar
with the patient.

900
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,319
I will assist.

901
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,157
Usually, a full cardiopulmonary bypass
is required for this complex suturing.

902
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,893
Dr. Hina, does your arm
allow you to do this?

903
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,831
I can do it.

904
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,602
-Setting up the ECMO.
-I'll take over.

905
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:34,372
-Dr. Fuyuki, how are her pupils?
-Reflecting light.

906
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:37,976
Good. We can't return blood with ECMO,
so we'll minimize blood loss.

907
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,277
-Electric scalpel.
-Electric scalpel set to 20.

908
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:40,378
DeBakey forceps.

909
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:41,512
Another DeBakey here.

910
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,880
ECMO established.

911
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:44,349
-Start it up.
-Yes.

912
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,386
Dr. Otowa, apply pressure
and suction to the bleeding area.

913
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:49,287
Yes.

914
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,957
Adhesions removed. Let's start by
clamping the pulmonary artery side.

915
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:54,492
Right angle forceps.

916
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,027
Vascular tape, red.

917
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,562
Blood pressure, 85/60.

918
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:58,696
Bleeding 250.

919
00:49:58,763 --> 00:49:59,864
-Satinsky.
-Here.

920
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,668
Clamped. Is the full flow achieved?

921
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:06,604
Yes, running at 3000 RPM, 2.5 liters.

922
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,806
-Then, let's proceed to the heart.
-Yes.

923
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11,943
Be aware that Kurumi has
an abnormal coronary artery course.

924
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,945
-Okay. Electric scalpel.
-Electric scalpel.

925
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:18,249
Blood pressure dropping to 45/21.

926
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:20,918
Suture between right ventricle and
conduit is torn, bleeding. 5-0 Prolene.

927
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:23,221
-Tokumaru, how's the flow?
-Flow is only at 50%.

928
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:27,058
What about using
a balloon catheter for hemostasis?

929
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,596
-Let's do it. Dr. Otowa.
-I'll assist.

930
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,563
A 10 Fr, please.

931
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,365
Ms. Natsume, 5-0 with both ends ready.

932
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:35,900
10 Fr balloon catheter.

933
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:36,868
Dr. Hina, syringe.

934
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,236
Inserting the balloon.

935
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,638
-It's in.
-Inflating with 5cc.

936
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,273
Stitching with purse string, 5-0 Prolene.

937
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,041
5-0.

938
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,544
-Please drop the needle.
-Cooper.

939
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,379
-Draining the water.
-Please do.

940
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,815
-Removing the balloon on three.
-Understood.

941
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,350
One, two…

942
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,117
-Three.
-Clamping.

943
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,287
-Removed.
-Bleeding has stopped.

944
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,156
Resuming dissection by the heart.

945
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,257
Electric scalpel.

946
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:00,158
Right angle forceps.

947
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,626
-Vascular tape.
-Yes.

948
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,728
-I'll pull it once you receive it.
-Yes.

949
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:05,396
Secured. Satinsky clamp, please.

950
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:07,999
Suturing laceration
on the artificial vessel. 5-0 Prolene.

951
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:08,900
5-0.

952
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:10,268
Removing from the pulmonary artery side.

953
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,169
Please do.

954
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,971
-Removed.
-Removing from the heart side.

955
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:15,873
-Please.
-Removed. How is it?

956
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:20,011
No bleeding.
Suture hemostasis is successful.

957
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,960
<i>Rescue and transport of the injured</i>
<i>are all completed.</i>

958
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:38,629
Thirty-four minor injuries.

959
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:39,931
Six serious.

960
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,265
And casualties…

961
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,133
CASUALTIES: 0

962
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,101
Zero!

963
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:50,675
Good work.

964
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:53,044
Well done.

965
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,153
Are you leaving, Minister Kamata?

966
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,990
Yes, I have an important meeting.

967
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,659
Thanks to Dr. Aoto's efforts,

968
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:11,696
we were able to
conclude with no fatalities.

969
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:15,466
Thank you for
introducing him to us, Minister Kamata.

970
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:17,902
I'm glad I could help.

971
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:23,708
Please continue to support
my direct jurisdiction over Tokyo MER.

972
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,210
Certainly!

973
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,485
Yes!

974
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:42,860
Thank you for your hard work.
Please pass my regards to Senju's squad.

975
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,796
-Good work!
-Oh, same to you.

976
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,932
Please have these.

977
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,501
Oh, thank you!

978
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:51,602
Thanks.

979
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,237
I'll take this one.

980
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:54,138
Good work.

981
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,576
You all are incredible.

982
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,581
All of you are
fully committed to saving lives.

983
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,416
It's truly incredible.

984
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,655
Especially Dr. Tsurumaki.

985
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,660
I'm sorry for treating you like an intern.

986
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,464
No, I'm not that significant.

987
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:23,935
I'm sure if Dr. Otowa
had done the surgery,

988
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,637
the adhesion separation
would have been done much quicker.

989
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,074
You're right.

990
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:35,413
And Dr. Otowa would also have
done the suture hemostasis more smoothly.

991
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,150
But, you know,

992
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,920
Dr. Hina, you don't have to
take on everything alone.

993
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:48,025
Dr. Otowa was doing
the compression hemostasis.

994
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,161
Dr. Fuyuki was
managing the overall condition.

995
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:52,863
Ms. Natsume was handling the instruments,

996
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,966
Ms. Minh was replenishing the materials,

997
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:58,169
and Tokumaru was managing the ECMO.

998
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,404
That's why Kurumi's surgery was a success.

999
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:04,041
And that's not all.

1000
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,578
Senju's men and the firefighters,

1001
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:10,014
the rescue squad,
the Coast Guard and the police,

1002
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:14,552
and Mr. Komaba
and Governor Akatsuka at the government.

1003
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,688
We couldn't have
saved everyone without them.

1004
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,629
We need more than doctors.

1005
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:30,167
That's how, with everyone's help,

1006
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:33,638
we have been saving lives all this time.

1007
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,545
That's the kind of team MER is.

1008
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:55,893
Well then, everyone,
thank you for your hard work today.

1009
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,962
Thank you.

1010
00:54:58,529 --> 00:54:59,830
Thank you.

1011
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:00,798
Thank you.

1012
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:24,121
And then Dr. Hina jumped off the bridge!

1013
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:25,323
Wow, that's amazing.

1014
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:28,526
Hey, now. Kurumi,
let's not talk about that anymore.

1015
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:31,495
Dr. Hina is Kurumi's hero after all.

1016
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,531
-Yeah!
-No, it wasn't anything special.

1017
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:35,232
It was so cool.

1018
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,205
I didn't expect you to have that in you.

1019
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:42,707
MINISTER KAMATA RESIGNS,
EFFECTIVELY OUSTED

1020
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,342
UNDER INVESTIGATION
FOR UNDERREPORTING INCOME

1021
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,812
It was the talk of the Ministry.
That the dud was hiding his fangs.

1022
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:53,918
That money-grubbing Minister
turned out to have lots of dirt.

1023
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,888
But the MER project shouldn't be affected.

1024
00:55:57,955 --> 00:55:58,856
AOTO

1025
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,762
Spread this organization nationwide.

1026
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,531
What will you do now?

1027
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,369
I'll go back to my hometown
and start over as a resident.

1028
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,006
I've always been half-hearted
in everything I've done,

1029
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,677
but I've realized
I want to continue being a doctor.

1030
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:29,520
Next time we meet at a site,
I'll be a doctor you can rely on.

1031
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,330
<i>Dr. Otowa is leaving,</i>

1032
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:42,533
and it seems the newly arrived
Dr. Aoto is leaving as well.

1033
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,170
What will you do about
a new second doctor?

1034
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,639
You've already
decided on a candidate, right?

1035
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,976
I'm sorry, but not yet.

1036
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:54,879
Um.

1037
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:59,116
Would anyone want to
take on the role of MER's second doctor?

1038
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:08,192
It seems best to consider
transferring to another hospital.

1039
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,498
No, wait… Huh?

1040
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,507
What's the matter, Dr. Tsurumaki?

1041
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:29,346
Could I…

1042
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:34,618
be given the opportunity
to be Tokyo MER's second doctor?

1043
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,489
Weren't you going to Cardiac Surgery?

1044
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:43,294
Dr. Kitami.

1045
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,031
What do you think?

1046
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,436
Is Dr. Tsurumaki up to the task of
being MER's second doctor?

1047
00:57:57,408 --> 00:58:01,745
Isn't it more about
what Dr. Tsurumaki herself thinks?

1048
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,324
Right now,

1049
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:16,327
there's no way I can replace Dr. Otowa.

1050
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:20,097
However,

1051
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:25,236
MER is made up of reliable staff.

1052
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,773
If I keep working with that team,

1053
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,409
someday, surely,

1054
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:35,646
I'll be able to catch up to Dr. Otowa.

1055
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,685
Someday, for sure,

1056
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:48,726
I'll become a doctor
who surpasses Dr. Otowa.

1057
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:56,467
It won't be that easy for
a newly trained doctor.

1058
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,602
She only just recovered from an injury.

1059
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:00,404
She's a woman, and it's dangerous.

1060
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:05,576
Her gender and her career
shouldn't matter, should they?

1061
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,413
I respect Dr. Tsurumaki

1062
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:12,883
and trust her

1063
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,853
as a physician.

1064
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,889
But she just finished her residency.

1065
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:25,095
Over the past year, Dr. Tsurumaki
has gained experience in the MER field.

1066
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:29,767
She knows MER better than anyone here.

1067
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,136
There's no one better suited

1068
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36,607
to replace Dr. Otowa than Dr. Tsurumaki.

1069
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:45,382
Dr. Takanawa, you mentored her.
What do you think?

1070
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,193
Unfortunately…

1071
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:02,733
if Dr. Tsurumaki has made this decision…

1072
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,538
then I will support her.

1073
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,343
Use the knowledge you gained with me

1074
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,713
to excel in emergency medicine.

1075
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,487
Thank you very much.

1076
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,861
Dr. Tsurumaki.

1077
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,368
I look forward to working with you.

1078
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:41,672
Yes.

1079
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,248
OTOWA

1080
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:22,279
Dr. Hina has become the second doctor.

1081
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:26,417
I see.

1082
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:37,061
I can't count
how many times you've saved us.

1083
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:43,267
There's gas on the ground.
Stand up and breathe.

1084
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:47,204
If I let you die,
it'll affect my assessment.

1085
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:48,105
<i>Dr. Otowa.</i>

1086
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:49,206
<i>You're a doctor, after all.</i>

1087
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:52,242
<i>Nothing is more important</i>
<i>than saving a life.</i>

1088
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,343
Don't give up.

1089
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:55,879
Live.

1090
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,481
Pulse is back!

1091
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,019
Chief Kitami!

1092
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:02,920
Damn you!

1093
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,289
You dragged us into this.

1094
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,724
And that's it for you?

1095
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,358
Come back, damn it!

1096
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,462
Don't do any medical practices
that have a risk of death, ever again.

1097
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:12,629
Right.

1098
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:18,302
Because I had you,
I could get away with being reckless.

1099
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,605
You were solid.

1100
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,241
The best partner.

1101
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,713
I only did what was
expected of me as a doctor.

1102
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:33,383
I never condoned your dangerous methods.

1103
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,954
The MER we're spreading nationwide

1104
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:39,456
will prioritize safety.

1105
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:45,662
If you spread MER,
even more lives can be saved than before.

1106
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,567
Let's work together as colleagues.

1107
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:55,539
The new MER

1108
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,209
might not become an ally,
but a rival to Tokyo's branch.

1109
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:12,756
I believe that

1110
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,661
Dr. Hina should be the second doctor.

1111
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:26,703
I'll leave Tokyo MER
in your hands from now on.

1112
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:49,459
A YEAR AND A HALF LATER

1113
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:35,038
So this is the ultimate ER car
that you were aiming to get.

1114
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,475
25% increase in operating room volume,

1115
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,944
newly equipped with
X-ray fluoroscopy and DSA,

1116
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,614
and allows for catheter treatments
that were impossible until now.

1117
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,983
The question is, who will master it?

1118
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:48,886
I heard she just arrived in Japan.

1119
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,854
Yokohama's chief doctor.

1120
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:54,391
You can't overlook it either.

1121
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,426
It's the talk of the town.

1122
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,397
You two were involved in the past, right?

1123
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:04,201
Chief Kamoi is an excellent doctor.
