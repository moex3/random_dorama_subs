[Nanmaru] Excuse me.

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,110
Hello there.

168
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:25,740
My name is Yoji Minamimaru.

169
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:29,957
Um, I was called for
by Professor Marugami.

170
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,756
It's Marukami.

171
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,721
Oh, it's not Marugami?

172

Minamima…

-Minamimaru--
-Just call me Nanmaru.

175
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,832
Minamimaru is hard to say.

176
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,961
-Nanmaru.
-[Nanmaru] Yes.

177
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay, Nanmaru it is then.
Take a seat over there.

178
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:04,985
[Emi] I apologize,
but Professor Marukami isn't here now.

179
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,868
What? Oh, aren't you
Professor Masami Marukami?

180
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:12,667
Professor Marukami is a man.
I'm Emi, a lecturer.

181
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,295
Right…

182
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:20,015
Can I sit here? Excuse me.

183
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:25,652
Professor Marukami is currently
in Tohoku for some research.

184
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:29,117
Nanmaru, do you have
any relatives in the Tohoku area?

185
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:33,375
Hmm…
[inhales deeply]

186
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,299
I don't think I have any close relatives.

187
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:39,805
-Is that so?
-[Nanmaru] Yes.

188
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:43,019
Then, are there any stories
passed down in your household?

189
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:44,438
Our household?

190
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,654
No, we're not that kind of family.

191
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,115
There's nothing like that.

192
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:50,367
Hmm…

193
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:52,246
Thank you.

194
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,751
[Nanmaru] What? Is that it?

195
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm sorry.
Only Professor Marukami knows the details.

196
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,220
I see…

197
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:05,188
Um, what does Professor Marukami teach?

198
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,318
History and folklore studies, why?

199
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,073

-Okay then.

Let's begin this regular meeting

237
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,985
of the New Skills Development
Research Society.

238
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:40,327
In this meeting, I'd like to decide
on the next club president.

239
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,707
Would anyone like
to put themselves forward as a candidate?

240

[Nanmaru] How about it, Asano?

00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:52,142
What?

242
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,023
Why me?

243
00:17:55,106 --> 00:18:00,367
You're quite diligent. I get the feeling
that you'd organize things well.

244
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,412
Actually, to be honest,

245
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:05,043
I think you should continue
being the president until you graduate.

246
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,963
You're the only telekinetic, after all.

247
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:10,638
That may be true,
but I've got job hunting to do as well.

248
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,558
That's exactly what is strange.

249
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,896
Why don't you use your powers
to get a job?

250
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:16,357
Well…

251
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,660
Supernatural abilities
aren't exactly meant for job hunting--

252
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:23,079
Then what are they for?

253
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:29,174
To save the world.

254
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:34,519
But this is more like
the club president's magic club.

255
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:37,942
It might not be spectacular,
but it's the real deal.

256
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:40,614
-Exactly.
-[student] She's right.

257

-What?
-Sure, it's the real thing.

260
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:51,970
Definitely a supernatural ability.
It's wondrous!

261
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:55,978
But why is it
such a useless, boring ability?

262
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,191
Who cares if you can open
a tiny hole like this?

263
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:00,779
It would be much quicker
to just use your hand.

264
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,623
That might be true, but…

265
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:08,002
I want to do something more practical!

266
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,298
This place
is just a bunch of useless people.

267
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,052
Being here has been a waste of time.

268
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,931
Such an ability is like no ability at all!

269
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,530
That was too cruel.

Why do we have to be useful to you?

271

We were all tricked,
by the words "new skills development."

272

Isn't that a bit of a stretch?

273

You're blaming everyone else,
like a child.

274
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,060
Why come back just to say that?

-Seriously.

Magic is valuable because it's performed
at just the right moment.

I've been looking for you.

323
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:21,054
Right, from the other day…

324
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:25,146
There's something I want your help with.

325
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:27,818
What?

326
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:31,366
[student] Has something happened?

327
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,037
[Nanmaru] What?

328
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,497
[student] Well, you're crying.

329
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,337
[Nanmaru] I'm not crying.

330
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,132
-[student] Is that right?
-Yeah.

331
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:44,142
[student] All right then, shall we go?

332
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:45,478
-[Nanmaru] What?
-[student] What?

333
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:47,524
[indistinct chatter]

334
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:52,868
[student] Professor Emi.

335
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,079
[Emi] Oh, Tagaya.

336
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:56,668
Nanmaru, sorry this is all so sudden.

337
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,128
[Nanmaru] It's okay…

338
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:01,218
Are you Nanmaru?
From the New Skills Research Society?

339
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,430
[Emi] The New Skills Research Society?

340
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,813
That's right. He's a telekinetic.

341
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,823
It's nothing special though.

342
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,286
Hmm…

343
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,668
A telekinetic, huh?

344
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,008
What is it?

345
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:25,349
Nanmaru, you are probably…

346
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:39,169
a descendant of Masayori Marukami,
a local feudal lord.

347
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,423
-What?
-[Emi] Which means, you share…

348
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:47,268
a common ancestor with Professor Marukami.

349
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:52,320
While researching his own family lineage,

350
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:55,034
he happened to find you,
who attends school here.

351
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:57,121
[chalk screeching]

352
00:23:57,205 --> 00:24:01,004
Masayori Marukami,
Professor Marukami, Minamimaru

353
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:03,885
Shortly after, he went to Marukawa Town
in the Kurone District…

354
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:14,532
"Marukami Village"

355
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:17,078
…to investigate the old Marukami Village.

356
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:18,957
Please wait a second.

357
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,712
Nanmaru, can you check
if any of your relatives

358
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,969
share a connection to Marukawa Town?

359
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:28,643
[Nanmaru] Well, I'm not sure about that…

360
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,110
-Ah, Grandad.
-[Tagaya] What?

361
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,116
[student] Does he look like your grandad?

362
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:37,619
[Nanmaru] No,

363
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,707
he doesn't look like him, but…

364
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,794
-[Tagaya] Huh?
-I just kind of thought that.

365
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:44,132
It just kind of, hit me.

366
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:47,723
It hit you?

367
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:49,475
[Nanmaru] Yes.

368
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:53,651
Oh, I should mention,
Professor Marukami is still only 50.

369
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:58,536
Maybe there's something that resonates
in your shared blood.

370
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,872
Right!

371
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:02,460
Did you feel
some kind of connection just now?

372
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,838
What?

373
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:06,636
Your family lines
might be surprisingly close.

374
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:10,602
I'm really grasping at straws here.
Please help me.

375
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:14,234
You seem really serious…

376
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:18,242
Has something happened
to Professor Marukami?

377
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,586
Professor Marukami…

378
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,220
never came back from Marukawa Town.

379
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:29,682
He's missing.

380
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:35,986
The last entry in the notebook
that the professor left at the lab

381
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,616
is the year
that Tadayori Minamimaru was killed.

382
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,541
Minamimaru was killed?

383
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,087
To put it simply,

384
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:49,513
your roots will serve as a clue
in tracing Professor Marukami's steps.

385
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:57,153
[Nanmaru] Right, I see.

386
00:25:57,236 --> 00:26:01,954
So you're saying it's been over 120 years

387
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,585
since the Minamimaru family
moved to the Kanto region.

388
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:07,674
-[Nanmaru's mom] Yes… that's right.
-[Nanmaru] I see.

389
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,561
Oh, yeah. Can you ask Dad
about Marukawa Town for me too?

390
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:16,776
-Huh?
-[Nanmaru] Hang on a second.

391
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,070
Okay…

392
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:21,242

394
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,960
Sorry about that.

395
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,213
[Nanmaru's mom] I'll ask him.

396
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,720
-But I doubt he knows anything.
-[switch clicks]

397
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,724
[Nanmaru] What? How do you know?

398
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,229
Well, you see, your dad,

399
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:40,406
has never shown
any interest in Marukawa Town.

400
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:43,871
Or at least, he's never mentioned it.

401
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:47,879
Maybe he doesn't think much of the place.

402
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,382
[Nanmaru] Is that right?

403
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,136
[sighs]

404
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,852
Don't tell me you just got home.

405
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,062
Yeah.

406
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:59,193
Are you eating properly?

407
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:04,036
O-Of course I am.

408
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,665
Really?

409
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,756
-You're probably not eating any veg.
-Ask him for me.

410
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,929
-I'll send you my homegrown green peppers.
-Okay, see you. Bye.

411
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:14,348
Right, I'll do that.

412
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:19,233

00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:01,109
I appreciate you coming, but…

we've received
more applications than expected.

422

I'm afraid we're fully booked this time.

-Is that right?
-[employee] Afraid so.

424
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:14,051
But you've come all this way,
so I'm happy to talk with you.

-Excuse me.

[employee] Hello.

439
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:05,487
I see, you'd like to book a lot?

440
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,579
Yes. A space just opened up now--

441
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:10,873
Hang on!

442
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,213
I'll enter. I'll join right away.

In that case, Mr. Asano,

00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:32,082
-I'd like you to fill in this form first.
-[Asano] Yes.

447
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,128
Do you happen to have your seal
with you today?

448
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:36,132
-[Asano] I have it.
-I thought you might.

449
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:41,727
-All right, please fill that in.

00:30:23,602 --> 00:30:25,397
On a scale of 1 to 10,000.

455
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,484
Wow. Why did you make this?
[chuckles]

456
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:29,071
-[Tagaya] I don't know.
-[Nanmaru] What?

457
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:31,242
But Professor Marukami asked me.

458
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,413
-For 400,000 yen.
-[Nanmaru] Oh…

459
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:37,547
So if Professor Marukami isn't found,
you won't get paid.

460
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,345
Don't say such frightening things.

461

[student] Making something like this
by hand nowadays…

462
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:46,648
-Even 400,000 yen seems cheap.
-[Nanmaru] Right.

-[Nanmaru] What?

but it seems they don't know anything.

-Is that so?
-[Nanmaru] Yeah.

00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:16,917
What did Professor Marukami
want to investigate in Marukawa Town?

473
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,384
Dewa Sengoku Chronicles

474
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:24,933
Marukawa Town, you see,

475
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,520
was once the domain

476
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:29,233
of a feudal lord named Shimadera
during the Sengoku period.

477
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:33,826
However, when the neighboring Mogami clan
invaded Shimadera territory,

478
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:37,290
the lord at the time,
Michiyasu Shimadera, confronted them.

479
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,336
This all happened in Marukami Village,

480
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,925
which was around
where Marukawa Town is currently located.

00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:45,098
However,

482
00:31:45,181 --> 00:31:48,689
that's when Michiyasu Shimadera's vassal,
Masayori Marukami,

483
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:51,987
ancestor to both you
and Professor Marukami,

484
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,661
suddenly betrayed him,
leading to Michiyasu's death in battle.

485
00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:56,997
What?

486
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,253
My ancestor was a traitor?
How disappointing.

487
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:02,925
That is the established theory,

488
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:05,806
but Professor Marukami
has raised objections to it.

489
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:10,649
[♪ mysterious music playing]

490
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,868
In April of the seventh year of Eiroku,
during which the battle occurred,

491
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:19,291
there is no evidence that the Mogami clan
mobilized their troops.

492
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:21,462
Naturally, they have no records

493
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:23,424
of any casualties or injuries
from this battle.

494
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,642
However, on the Shimadera side,
there were as many as 300 fatalities,

495
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:30,438
including the lord himself, Michiyasu.

496
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:36,283
In the same period, Tadayori Minamimaru,
who was from Marukami Village,

497
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,496
was killed by Michiyasu.

498
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:45,260
Based on this,

499
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:50,228
I would like to propose the theory
that Marukami alone defeated Shimadera.

500
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:54,403
So you're saying

501
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:58,369
that this battle was to avenge Tadayori?

502
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:00,415
That's right.

503
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:05,593
Moreover, just 10 days after the battle,
for 7 days from April 29th,

504
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:07,972
a festival was held in Marukami Village.

505
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:12,815
Isn’t it strange to not flee,
but to hold a festival in the place

506
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,819
where they betrayed and killed their lord?

507
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:23,085
It's possible that Masayori Marukami
was never a vassal of Shimadera at all.

508
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:29,557
[Tagaya] But I still think it's unlikely.

509
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,358
Records indicate that Marukami Village
had a population of about 200 at the time.

510
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:39,869
This means that at most,
there were only 60 to 80 combatants.

511
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:43,627
To think they fought the Shimadera army,
which was said to exceed 3,000 people,

512
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,883
and that they even killed the general
is unimaginable.

513
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:52,979
[student]
I think the established theory is correct.

514
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:57,697
Professor Marukami probably wanted
to make him seem cool since it's his--

515
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,907
Professor Marukami…

516
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,132
Professor Marukami would never engage
in such low-level favoritism.

517
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:10,764
Sorry.

518
00:34:14,897 --> 00:34:16,066
Um…

519
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,866
What if, just what if,

520
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,039
the people of Marukami Village

521
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:27,255
had dug a huge pitfall
at the site of the battle.

522
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:29,927
How do you dig a pitfall for 3,000 people?

523
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:32,516
[Nanmaru] Uh…

524
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,896
Sorry for my stupid idea.

525
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,200
I'll just go to the toilet.

526
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:52,515
Still, he might actually
be on to something.

527
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,269
Here. Look at these two mountains.

528
00:34:55,896 --> 00:34:58,109
Both of them seem kind of strange.

529
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,697
-Strange?
-[Tagaya] Yeah.

530
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:03,202
Their shape is kind of unnatural.

531
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,582
They have a deliberate feel

532
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,588
as if they were made artificially.

533
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,553
I guess that can't be though.

534
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,821
[Nanmaru] Don't you think
Professor Emi seemed kind of down?

535
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:25,288
[Tagaya] Of course she is. She's missing
her beloved Professor Marukami.

-Is that why?
-[Tagaya] Yeah.

And there's one more person
down in the dumps.

-You're so annoying.

-[Nanmaru] What do you mean?

something so unnecessary?

-It's not unnecessary.
-It was!

00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,206
Show me your ability.

643
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,375
[Nanmaru] What?

644
00:42:28,008 --> 00:42:29,302
Please.

645
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:31,849
All right…

646
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,186
Okay then.

You were so loud.

-That's what shocked you?

654
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:13,599
It's small.

655
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:16,980
It's small,

656
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,528
but I think it's the same.

657
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:20,947
What?

658
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:28,587
After that, I had a chance to talk
with Professor Marukami's wife.

659
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,219
She said she never saw it herself,

660
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:38,816
but that Professor Marukami
had acquired some kind of ability.

661
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:43,074
She brought one of the items
that was left in his study.

662
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:58,606
[student] If it is the same ability,

663
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:00,233
it's on another level.

[♪ mysterious music playing]

665
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,160
According to his wife,

666
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:10,003
she often saw flashes
like those of a camera

667
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:13,134
and dry popping sounds
coming from the study.

668
00:44:15,556 --> 00:44:17,769
[♪ mysterious music continues playing]

669
00:45:03,192 --> 00:45:04,738
I can't believe it.

670
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,202
This ability really exists.

671
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:18,097
Maybe it's a skill only those
with Marukami blood can perform.

672
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:23,232
Um…

673
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:27,366
I saw something on the news before.

674
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:28,577
[Nanmaru] The news?

675
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:40,266
[anchor] A horrific murder has occurred
in a tranquil mountain town.

676
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,526
The victim, 51-year-old Toshio Kuraishi,
was a construction company president

677
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,116
from Marukawa Town
in Akita Prefecture's Kurone District.

678
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:52,290
According to the prefectural police,
Mr. Kuraishi was found collapsed

679
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:57,969
with his head and right arm gouged out,
possibly by a sharp blade.

680
00:45:58,052 --> 00:46:02,102
A company employee who came to work early
discovered him and made the report.

681
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:05,776
Additionally, a large hole was found

682
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,156
in the window of the room where the body…

683
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,410
Isn't this going a bit too far?

684
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:15,170
No weapon likely used in the crime…

685
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:16,757
-A hole…
-…or signs of external entry…

686
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,846
-A hole?
-…were found at the scene.

687
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:23,604
Police are seeking information
from local residents.
