when he was killed by Michiyasu Shimadera.

That's why his relative,

sent his youngest child to be adopted
by the Minamimaru family

[Nanmaru] A festival.

161
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,206
Marukawa Festival

162
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:49,380
[Nanmaru] "From June 18th… to June 24th."

163
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:50,550
That's seven days!

164
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,180
Wow, that's long.

165
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:56,436
-What kind of festival could it be?
-Good question.

166
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,069
[Sachiko] It's the Tanabata Festival.

167
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:03,701
[Tagaya] Huh?

168
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:07,793
Tanabata is usually in July,
or August on the old lunar calendar,

169
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,755
so June is a bit unusual, isn't it?

170
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:13,888
I suppose that's true.

171
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,894
[Sachiko]
It's always been held in June here.

172
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,146
[Tagaya] Interesting…

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,904
[Sachiko] What would you like to order?

174
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,869
-[Tagaya] What will you get?
-[Nanmaru] Hmm?

175
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,874
Um, iced coffee then.

176
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:30,589
-Two please.
-All right.

177
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,889
-[Sachiko] Two iced coffees.
-[cafe owner] Coming right up.

178
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,561
Hmm? What is it?

179
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:39,480
It's just, that girl…

180
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:43,280
-[Nanmaru] We might be closely related.
-[Tagaya] What?

181
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,326
It just kind of hit me.

182
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:48,791
-It hit you, huh?
-Mm.

183
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,587
So it's not because she's your type?

184
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,674
-That's not the reason.
-What?

185
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:53,885
-What?
-Really?

186
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,095
Yeah.

187
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,891
Sorry for the wait.

188
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:05,700
[Sachiko] Here's your milk.

189
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:07,954
[glass clanks]

190
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:10,000
-[Sachiko] Enjoy.
-Thank you.

191
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:11,127
[Tagaya] Thanks.

192
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:17,181
-[door bell chimes]
-[villager 1 sighs]

193
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,520
-[Sachiko] Welcome.
-Hey.

194
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:21,524
-Boss.
-[cafe owner] Hey.

195
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,320
[exhales deeply]

196
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:27,703
[grunts]

197
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,001
[exhales deeply]

198
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,382
-[cafe owner] Here you go.
-Thanks.

199
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,560
[groans]

200
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:42,607
The police are being such a pain
because of the incident.

201
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:45,487
[villager 1] Why bother coming back
if you go and do something like that?

202
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,784
[cafe owner] You think it was that person?

203
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,289
[villager 1] Of course. Who else is there?

204
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:51,917
Who else can do that kind of thing?

205
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:55,132
-Right, Sachi?
-What?

206
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,346
[softly]
Hey. You're being too loud.

207
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,184
There are other customers here.

208
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:02,480
[villager 1] They won't understand.

209
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,233
Just stop.

210
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,904
It was murder, after all.

211
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,158
[villager 1 whispers]
Fine.

212
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:12,959
By the way, what about that professor?

213
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,673
[villager 1] Quite something.

214
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:18,053
You can tell they're a direct descendant.

215
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:21,309
This coming festival is shaping up
to be a pretty good one.

216
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,396
[cafe owner] It's like the revival
of Lord Marukami, huh?

217
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,733
-Right!
-Exactly.

218
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,071
-[laughter]
-[Tagaya] Excuse me.

219
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,749
The professor you mentioned just now.

220
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,672
Is that Professor Masami Marukami?

221
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,268
[all] Nope.

222
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,648
I see.

223
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,950
So, who might you two be?

224
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:54,458
Ah. We're students of Professor Marukami.

225
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,926
We lost touch with Professor Marukami
after he came to this town,

226
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,345
so we came to look for him.

227
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,603
Let's see.

228
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,706
Certainly, the name "Marukami" is the same
as the feudal lord who lived around here.

229
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,547
[villager 2] This Professor Marukami…

230
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,010
-Does he have family ties to this town?
-[Tagaya] Yes.

231
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,557
He said he had roots in this town.

232
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:25,270
Is that so?

233
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:29,278
So, you really don't know him?

234
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm sorry to say,

235
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:33,704
but I have no idea who he is.

236
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:37,963
We were just discussing
preparations for the festival.

237
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:39,883
"Professor" and "lord"

238
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:42,973
are the names we give
for roles within the festival, you see.

239
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,897
Is that right? Sorry for my interruption.

240
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,149
Not at all.

241
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,404
[Tagaya] Let's go, Nanmaru.

242
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,782
[Nanmaru] Hang on.

243
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:53,284
Hey! Wait a second.

244
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,625
Excuse me for asking,

245
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,715
but did he just call you Nanmaru?

246
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:04,015
Ah… My last name is Minamimaru.

247
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:08,566
My ancestors also lived here.
I think his name was Masayori Marukami.

248
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,318
The same as Professor Marukami.

249
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:14,160
-Oh my!
-My goodness.

250
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,540
-How rude of us!
-What?

251
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,713
So that's who you are. Mr. Minamimaru!

252
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:22,217
-[Nanmaru] What?
-How young you are! How old are you?

253
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,388
-[Nanmaru] W-What?
-How about another coffee?

254
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:26,894
-[Nanmaru] Uh…
-Our cod roe spaghetti is delicious.

255
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:29,649
-[villager 1] Delicious!
-[villager 2] Right!

256
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:32,154
-But…
-Please, sit down.

257
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:35,703
[Emi] I'd like to ask you something.

258
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:38,500
Did this person come here?

259
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,228
No.

260
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:51,359
He never stayed here.

261
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,868
Did you come all the way from Tokyo
to search for this person?

262
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,412
[Emi] Yes.

263
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,335
Please contact me
if you discover anything.

264
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,924
-Here's my card.
-[receptionist] Certainly.

265
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,721
You must be terribly worried.

266
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,811
-Thank you.
-[receptionist] Of course.

267
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,214
[footsteps approaching]

268
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,470
-[student] Welcome back.
-Thanks.

269
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:30,061
It was no use. I didn't find anything out.

270
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,859
I see.

271
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:36,658
But several people
looked clearly flustered

272
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,579
when they saw
Professor Marukami's picture.

273
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,167
-You thought so too?
-[distant chatter]

274
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,503
Actually, me too…

275
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,465
[Tagaya] Mr. Minamimaru!

276
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,221
-Shall I carry that for you?
-Stop that impression.

277
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:48,807
-[student] Welcome home.
-[both] Hello.

278
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,603
-[student] How did it go?
-It was amazing.

279
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,397
Nanmaru is a lord.

280
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,692
-A lord?
-[Nanmaru] No, I'm not.

281
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:56,280
[Tagaya] Right this way. Please sit down.

282
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:57,659
How old are you?

283
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:59,537
-I'm 21.
-[Tagaya] Wow!

284
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,708
-Young and spunky!
-What are you saying?

285
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,344
[student] You're a lord for real!

286
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,223
-A real lord!
-[Tagaya] That's right.

287
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,770
They were acting really unfriendly,

288
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,941
but completely changed their tune
when they found out.

289
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,360
[Nanmaru and student laugh]

290
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,072
[Tagaya] You're laughing like a lord!

291
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:20,621
But a Tanabata in June,

292
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,291
that's unusual, isn't it?

293
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,752
That's true.

294
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:27,802
Do you know what the "Tanabata"
in Tanabata Festival refers to?

295
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:29,764
I do.

296
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,814
It's the story in which Altair and Vega,
envisioned as lovers,

297
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:38,824
cross the Milky Way
to meet once a year, isn't it?

298
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,329
[Nanmaru] Altair?

299
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:43,291
[splutters]
Vega?

300
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:47,508
[Tagaya] Mm. They're different names
for Hikoboshi and Orihime.

301
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:48,969
[exclaims]

302
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,140
-I get it.
-[Tagaya] Now you get it.

303
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,862
It is said
that for Altair and Vega to meet…

304
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,073
"Altair, Vega"

305
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:00,325
…this bridge

306
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,584
was made by laying out Kasasagi feathers.

307
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,675
Therefore, Kasasagis are said
to be mediators between men and women.

308
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,138
-Wow. I never knew that.
-Hmm.

309
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:14,269
But there are no Kasasagis
in the Tohoku region.

310
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:17,150
In Japan, they're only found in Kyushu.

311
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,823
Furthermore, it is said
that they came to Japan

312
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:23,162
after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's
invasions of Korea.

313
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,252
Then, it would be strange for Kasasagis

314
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,799
to be on flags from Tohoku
in the Sengoku period, right?

315
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:33,224
This means that the origin of the Kasasagi
depicted on the Marukami flag

316
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:35,896
must have been some kind of drawing

317
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,735
that came to this village
along with the Tanabata story.

318
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,115
The Kasasagi
must have gradually become symbolized

319
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:44,163
and further established
with each Tanabata Festival.

320
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,585
That's why they could draw it,
even with no Kasasagis.

321
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,670
[Emi] Exactly.

322
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:52,012
But… I still don't know
why they chose to have it on their flag.

323
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,978
[all] Hmm…

324
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,690
That's a difficult question.

-[receptionist] Excuse me.
-Yes?

326
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:05,539
There are some townspeople
waiting at the entrance.

327
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:08,712
Okay.

328
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,651
Are you Mr. Minamimaru?

329
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:21,780
[Nanmaru] Yes…

330
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:25,203
Welcome to the land of your ancestors,

I'm a member of the town council.

334
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:43,030
My name is Genichiro Hayano.

335
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,786
Having heard about your visit,

336
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,165
Mr. Minamimaru,

337
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:51,715
we decided to host a modest banquet
to welcome you all.

338
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,804
[♪ quirky music playing]

339
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:58,060
Actually…

340
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:02,152
we came to this town
with a specific purpose.

341
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:05,450
Yes. I've heard all about it.

342
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:09,709
I understand you have come here
out of concern

343
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,548
for Professor Marukami's whereabouts.
[inhales sharply]

344
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:13,842
We at Marukawa Town,

intend to help you
with all our resources--

346
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,979
Mr. Hayano, this isn't an election.

-Right.

How should I ask this?

382
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:49,069
Has it been passed down to you too,
Mr. Minamimaru?

383
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:50,948
You know.

You mean the supernatural ability?

-Wow!
-That's it!

392
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:18,168
In that case,
how about a display for everyone--

393
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:21,466
Sorry to interrupt the fun.

394
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:24,180
But we'd like your cooperation.

395
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:29,900
I'm Kanemura from the prefectural police's
First Investigation Division.

396
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:34,075
I would like to ask a few questions

397
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,706
about the recent murder
of Mr. Toshio Kuraishi.

398
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,883
Detective, how can you
barge in here like this?

399
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,511
-Right.
-[villagers] Right!

400
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,350
Don't worry.
I won't take much of your time.

401
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,780
It appears the main opposition
to the golf course construction

402
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,742
are all gathered here.

403
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:03,593
You lot are from out of town though,
aren't you?

404
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:06,348
That's right.

405
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,149
-What are you here for?
-[♪ tense music playing]

406
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,782
Stop it already! You have no right
to interrogate our guests.

407
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,830
-[villagers] That's right!
-Come on. This isn't an interrogation.

408
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:23,298
However, I think they ought to know.

409
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:26,639
That recently,
a murder occurred in this town,

410
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,810
and the murderer is still at large.

411
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:33,068
And that the people
who were vehemently opposing

412
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:39,080
the victim's golf course construction
are gathered here right now.

413

[Mr. Hayano] Mr. Kanemura, was it?

414
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,305
If you continue to make such rude remarks,

415
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,269
we will have to take action as well.

the festival will be taking place

00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,531
The festival is nearly here.

476
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,964
Are we free to climb the mountain
when the festival isn't on?

477
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:52,884
[Mr. Hayano] Well, of course.

478
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,888
I see.

479
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,644
In that case,

480
00:27:58,228 --> 00:28:01,442
Professor Marukami
would have been able to enter last month.

481
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:04,240
Well, I'm not sure.

482

We weren't here last month, you see.

Understood.

00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:30,877
[Mr. Hayano]
Technically, the festival hasn't started,

490
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,964
so I will grant you special permission.

491
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,722
However, please make it brief.

492
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:39,936
-[Emi] Okay.
-Thank you.

-Thank goodness.

497

-Mr. Hayano, are you sure about this?
-[Mr. Hayano] Huh?

498
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:54,508
It's Mr. Minamimaru, after all.

499

-[Nanmaru] Just a bit more.

[Tagaya] Hey. You're going too fast.

509
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:31,289

They look just like normal rocks.

513
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:49,408
[Emi] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

514
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:50,661
Seven rocks.

515
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,588
There doesn't seem to be much else here.

516

[Tagaya exhales deeply]

517
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:03,144
[Tagaya] I knew it, that mountain…
Mount Kurone.

518
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:08,112
Because of that mountain, the sunset
comes early in this entire area.

519
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:13,498
[Nanmaru] But even after the sun sets,

520
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:17,590
it feels like it might reappear
from that opening at the base.

521
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:23,434
In the end,
we didn't find any clues here, huh?

Could it be… that it hit you too?

-[♪ quirky music playing]
-What?

Sachiko Higashimaru.

00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:03,212
So it is.

00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:06,970
-[Sachiko] So it is?

[Sachiko] You seem like a normal person.

Since you're living a normal life,

I don't think
anyone has the right to interfere.

We didn't find any clues at all, did we?

578
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,019
Also, the people in this town

579
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:58,192
have gotten friendlier
thanks to that daft lord,

580

I think that Professor Marukami…

582
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:09,381
might be being held prisoner
somewhere in this town.

You're overthinking it.

But we've been searching all over
and not gotten any witness information.

[student] That's true, but…

588
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:26,791
Moreover, this town is hiding something…

So that's how it is.

-Here, a large portion.
-[Tagaya] Thanks.

What's that?

809
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:15,233
[Tagaya] What is it, Professor?

810
00:50:20,243 --> 00:50:21,328
Professor?

811
00:50:22,163 --> 00:50:23,415
-Come on.
-What?

812
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:25,629
Professor!

813
00:50:27,298 --> 00:50:28,927
Professor! Wait!

814
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,312

Hey! Wait there!

819
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,969
Look at what you did!

820
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:57,568
I'd like to have a few words with you,
young man.

821
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:05,374
[Tagaya] Professor.

822
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:07,504
Look, above Mount Marukami.

823
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:08,715
[Tagaya] What?

824
00:51:11,512 --> 00:51:14,351
[student] It's glowing. Is it a bonfire?

825
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:17,315
[Tagaya] No. But I wonder what it is.

826
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,029
[Emi] I'm going to go check it out.

827
00:51:20,112 --> 00:51:23,160
-Right now?
-Isn't it off-limits?

828
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:26,249
[Emi] It's fine.
You two wait at the inn.

829
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,295
We can't let you go alone.

830
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:32,011
[Emi] We can't all go.

831
00:51:32,638 --> 00:51:34,391
All right, you come with me, Tagaya.

832
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,146
Sakuragi, you meet up with Nanmaru
back at the inn.

833
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:39,109
-Okay.
-[Emi] Let's go.

He's stuck a jewel to his head.

No, it's embedded.

Disgusting.

I thought it was off-limits.

Professor Emi said
she just had to go and see it.

Does this mean one rock disappears
