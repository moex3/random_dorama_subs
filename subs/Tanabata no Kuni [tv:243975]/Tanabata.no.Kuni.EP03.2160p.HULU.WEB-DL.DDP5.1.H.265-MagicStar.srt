00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,173
[Emi] We're looking for this person,
you see.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:05,678
Don't think I've seen him before.

3
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:08,016
Are you Mr. Minamimaru?

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:13,151
[Mr. Hayano] Welcome to the land
of your ancestors, Marukami Village!

5
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:15,698
Hey.

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,992
Big brother…

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:20,499
[Emi] This town is hiding something,
and everyone is in on it.

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,627
[Sachiko] As far as I know,

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,883
there are only five people Within Reach,
including you.

10
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,681
Five telekinetics?

11
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:29,810
[Emi] Look, above Mount Marukami.

12
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:31,981
I'm going to go check it out.

13
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,358
[Sakuragi] Isn't it off-limits?

14
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:34,861
[Emi] There are only six rocks.

15
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:39,621
Does this mean one rock disappears
each day of the seven-day festival?

What's this about?

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,160
Apparently, they were planning
to carve out

22
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:00,663
the course from the Seven Peaks

23
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:03,418
to the east of Mount Marukami,
and from Mount Marukami itself.

24
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:07,176
Yeah, the place Tagaya built a model of.

It seems there's been a misunderstanding.

53

[Mr. Hayano] We have been performing
the Tanabata ritual,

passed down through generations
of the Marukami family.

It's Nanmaru. Thanks!

[Takashi] Do you know a guy
called Minamimaru?

[Tagaya] Who are you?

189
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:28,778
Just tell me.

190
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:33,495
You went to Marukawa Town
with a Minamimaru, right?

191

He's not here today.

192

Then, what are his contact details?

193

I don't know.

194
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,479
[Takashi] Surely you do know.

195

You're so persistent!

You're not from this school, are you?

[Aki] Excuse me!

Could it be

201
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:14,953
that you're interested

202
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:20,088
in the "Chowa!" that Nanmaru does?

203

It was fun talking to you. From Sachiko.

I ended up

209
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,017
being so half-hearted.

210
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:52,069
Nanmaru! We might have a new recruit.

-[Takashi] What are you talking about?

Well, it's hard to explain--

216
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,149
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

217
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,823
You have…

218
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:19,206
the Ability to Reach, don't you?

219
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:21,587

Okay.

00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:30,145
Wait, I'll come with you!

00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,065
Thanks for your help.

Huh?

225
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,587
[Takashi] All right, show me the power
that you showed Sachiko.

226
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,423

Eh?

No good at all.

Sir, does that mean
you have the Ability to Reach too?

Listen.

You were focusing on the mark you made
on the paper just now, right?

242
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:42,289
It's going to hit the material
and disappear as soon as you bring it.

243
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,378
That's why it doesn't get big.

244
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,341
[Nanmaru] Bring it?

245
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,679
[Takashi] Midair.

[Nanmaru] Midair?

247

[Takashi] Create it in midair.

00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,158

What the heck is that ball?

251

[Takashi] It's this sphere
that is known as "Beyond the Window."

252
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,299
Those who can make this are Within Reach.

Being Within Reach

means reaching Beyond the Window.

275
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,335
[Takashi] You extend your hand,

276
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:34,842
grab a little from Beyond the Window
and bring it to you.

Imagine you have another thumb…

existing symmetrically to your thumb
and the outside of your pinky finger.

283
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,467
Create the sphere by imagining yourself

Hello.

501
00:40:30,982 --> 00:40:33,988
[Takashi] You took so long
to pick up, Minamimaru.

502
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:39,666
How can I help you?

503
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,722
I see potential in your power.

504
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:51,732
There's something I want your help with.

507
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:19,036
It has been a long time, Great-uncle.

508
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,625
-It's Sachiko.
-[Sachiko's great-uncle] Oh.

509
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:23,880
Enter.

510
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:32,939
Excuse me.

511
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:55,818
[Sachiko's great-uncle]
Is your grandmother well?

512
00:41:57,112 --> 00:41:58,114
She is.

513
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:04,377
[Sachiko]
I came today to tell you something.

514
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:08,051
There are suspicious men in the town.

515
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:13,436
[Sachiko's great-uncle]
It seems they came by here too.

516
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:15,148
Pardon?

517
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,198
[Sachiko's great-uncle]
Takashi and Professor Marukami…

518
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,121
And me…

519
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,924
They're searching for those Within Reach.

520
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,014

521
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,046
[soft groan]

522

[♪ tense music playing]

523
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,811
I have…

524
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,153
a terrible feeling.

525
