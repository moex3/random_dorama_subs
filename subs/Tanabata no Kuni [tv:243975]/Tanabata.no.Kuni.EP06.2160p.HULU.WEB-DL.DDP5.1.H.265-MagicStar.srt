[Sachiko] My father
couldn't adapt to Marukami.

He began to discipline my brother

Listen, Takashi.

Being Within Reach is about
reaching your hand Beyond the Window.

You reach out, grab a little bit
of Beyond the Window and bring it back.

You've got it.

[Sachiko] My brother
became infatuated with Yoriyuki,

78
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:32,571
who started sending him
to the main Marukami household

That was Yukiko's boy.

He became attached to Yoriyuki,
and my father continued to belittle him.

00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:56,912
left this world.

168
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,075
Mom…

169
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,208
Right after that,

170
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,049
Yoriyuki left Marukawa Town.

171
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,865
He said he was sure
to be free of his dreams.

172
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:42,419
But he's a prisoner
of his dreams even now.

173
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,561
After all, his dreams…
are scarier than anybody else's.

174
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:59,203
What makes you say that?

175
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,298
The construction worker
who was killed in Marukawa Town…

176
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,810
He tried to get rid of Mount Marukami.

177
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,985
But…

178
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,619
Yoriyuki couldn't forgive him for that.

179
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,386
Not only not forgive him…

180
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,477
When he found out…

181
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:36,611
he felt like he just had to do something.

182
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:42,164
Was he…

183
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,422
murdered by Yoriyuki Marukami?

184
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,094
Is that really what happened?

185
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:52,142
Only Yoriyuki can do something like that.

186
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:56,359
My brother couldn't.

187
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,329
My brother has always been pathetic,

188
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,795
just like his power.

189
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,890
He's always cared what people think.

190
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:17,735
He'll surely…

191
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,160
care for the rest of his life.

192
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:31,220
That's why he could never
actually murder someone.

193
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:41,575
I should say all this one day…

I don't know what to say.

Nanmaru…

200
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:24,911
The good thing about you,

201
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,835
is that you don't think
about things negatively.

202
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,012
So don't worry about it.

203
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,062
I always wanted to tell somebody.

204
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:50,796
But the truth is…

205
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,394
I…

206
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:04,907

They did.

234

[Nanmaru] Yeah, but…

267
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:17,365
I do know that. But…

that you're bored of your ability!

00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:38,992
if I should really use my ability
so casually.

-[student 2] Casually?
-[Nanmaru] Yeah. So casually.

281
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:55,525
[student 2] If it wasn't casual,
would it be fine?

288
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,113
Sorry to keep calling you here, Nanmaru.

289
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:20,240
Not at all.

290
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:24,833
You're a lot closer to the people
of Marukawa Town than we are.

291
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,380
I thought you might have some information.

292
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,465
[Nanmaru] Well, um…

293
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,885
I don't know anything special.

294
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,054
The thing is,

295
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:34,687
there's a lot that they don't share
with people outside the town.

296
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,822
In Professor Marukami's letter,

297
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:42,744
he never touches upon
those kinds of secrets either.

298
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:46,376
Like he completely belongs
to that village now.

299
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,808
But is the Professor Marukami we know

300
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:56,647
the type of person who could keep

301
00:26:57,064 --> 00:27:00,237
hard-earned research results
to himself forever?

302
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:03,828
No. He never could.

303
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:07,669
Which means, as a village member,
he can't tell secrets.

304
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,007
But he wants to share his research.

305
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,641
When I read the letter again,
supposing that's how he felt,

306
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:17,396
I noticed two strange sentences.

307
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,524
Strange sentences?

308
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:25,747
The first one.

309
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,838
[Emi] "Since coming here,
I've gotten into a good routine,

310
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:31,717
and I've become much healthier.

311
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:36,059
Although I'm not timing it with a clock,

312
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:38,230
it's so precise,
it's as if the annual calendar

313
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:41,319
has been perfectly split
according to the solar year."

314
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,868
See, doesn't the phrasing sound unnatural?

315
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:47,749
Do people normally say "solar year"?

316
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,420
[Tagaya] Maybe not…

317
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,258
[Emi] The second one.

318
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,478
"I realized that the order of the schedule
for the annual festival

319
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:00,942
and the flag was reversed.

320
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:03,614
I mentioned it to the townspeople,

321
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:07,162
but they said it would be strange
to change it after all this time,

322
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:09,876
so we'll continue as things are
from next year too."

323
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,966
Makes no sense, does it?

324
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,678
Not at all.

325
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:18,519
First, regarding the solar year.

326
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:24,196
"Precision like that of a solar year,
despite not measuring by a clock."

327
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,621
What made this click for me

328
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:31,294
were the dates of the old
Tanabata festivals we looked up recently.

329
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,714
-[Sakuragi] Oh, yeah.

330
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:35,427
Even before the Western calendar
came to Japan,

331
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:38,266
the festival dates
were being aligned to it.

332
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,354
[♪ mysterious music playing]

333
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,032
When I looked up
the festival dates at that time,

334
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:50,332
converting them to the Western calendar,
they were mostly on June 18th or 19th,

335
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:52,754
with just one on June 17th.

336
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:54,298
That means three variations.

337
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,429
But if they already knew
the Western calendar,

338
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,475
why not just standardize it to one date?

339
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,855
Exactly. That's a good point.

340
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:05,780
Which means,
it wasn't the Western calendar.

341
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,163
It was the solar year!

342
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,271
How many days are in a year, exactly?

343
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:23,524
365 days.

344
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:24,776
-Incorrect.
-Huh?

345
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,655
How many exactly?

346
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:30,872
Including leap years, it's 365.25 days.

347
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:33,084
Leap years occur once every 4 years,

348
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:35,631
10 times in 40 years,
and how many times in 400 years?

349
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:36,925
-100!
-[clicks tongue]

350
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,011
Incorrect.

351
00:29:38,094 --> 00:29:39,723
-[Nanmaru] Huh?
-[chuckles]

352
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:44,608
It's 97 times. Adjustments are made.

353
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:49,910
Therefore, to be precise…

354
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:59,053
[Emi] The correct number is 365.2425 days.

355
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:01,390
And for the solar year…

356
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,490
the correct number is 365.24219 days.

357
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,912
There's still an error
even after adjustments.

358
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,087
[Tagaya] I get it.

359
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,801
The discrepancies that arose
when adjusting for that error

360
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,305
led to three different
festival start dates!

361
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:22,767
Precisely.

362
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:25,355
Then,

363
00:30:25,438 --> 00:30:26,775
what do you think happens

364
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,446
in the seven-day period
before and after June 18th,

365
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:30,741
when the festival is held?

366
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,035
[Tagaya] Uh…

367
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,256
The summer solstice.

368
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:41,387
-The summer solstice!
-[Sakuragi] Ah…

369
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,561
In astronomy, the summer solstice
doesn't refer to a date

370
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:47,692
like June 21st or 22nd,
but rather, a specific moment.

371
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:49,571
Therefore,

372
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:53,662
the schedule for the age-old
Marukami Village festival

373
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,958
includes the day
of the summer solstice moment,

374
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,547
plus three days before and after,
making it a seven-day event.

375
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:02,639
[students exclaiming]

376
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:06,730
Hang on, you've realized
something amazing here.

377
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:09,026
Then what about the other sentence?

378
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:12,157
The festival schedule
and flag being reversed…

379
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,242
[Tagaya] Right.

380
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,833
I have no idea.

381
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,506
-[Tagaya and Nanmaru] No way.
-[Sakuragi chuckles]

382
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:23,179
-[Tagaya] I see.
-You don't know, huh?

383
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,561
[Tagaya] Nanmaru, do you know
what a summer solstice is?

384
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:27,939
Sure do. It's a bright day.

385
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,818
-The brightest of the year.
-[Sakuragi] Are you sure?

386
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:33,909
[interviewer] Yoji Minamimaru…

387
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,542
Kanji Kentei,

388
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:40,255
pre-level two, huh.

389
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,217
That's right.

390
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:47,269
[interviewer] Are you sure about this?
It's hard work.

391
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:50,693
In many ways, to tell the truth.

392
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,324
So it is hard work then?

393
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,418
[interviewer]
Why did you decide to become a cleaner?

394
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,340
[Nanmaru] Hmm…

395
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:08,061
I feel like it relates to my ability.

396
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,315
-Ability?
-[Nanmaru] Yeah.

397
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,824
Resume
Yoji Minamimaru

398
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:15,910
[interviewer] Right…

399
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:20,251
Sure. Cleaning is
the foundation of culture.

400
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:24,803
These days, culture essentially cleans up
after civilization.

401
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:30,230
And there,
a tremendous positive force emerges

402
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:35,448
to pull us back to zero
from a filthy, highly negative state.

403
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,412
Do you get it?

404
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,505
Yeah… A positive force, right?

405
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,928
Oshita? What are you doing here?

406
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:47,723
Ah.

407
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,896
Just explaining the job.

408
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,567
Oh.
[soft chuckle]

409
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,944
[soft chuckle]

410
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:57,284
-[Oshita] See you then.
-Thank you.

411
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:00,583
[Oshita grunts]

412
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:02,670
[Oshita huffs]

413
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:05,593
[clerk] All right then.

414
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:10,351
Let's start the interview, shall we?

415
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:13,567
What? Then who was that just now?

416
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,199
Oshita, the part-timer?

417
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,119
Ah.

418
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:21,833
He's been with us for a while.

419
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,589
I heard he's been a part-timer
ever since graduating from university.

420
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:32,939
[cleaner breathes heavily]

421
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:40,370
Here's to Nanmaru and his new life.

422
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,667
[all] Cheers!

423
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,336
[student 1] Cheers.

424
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,257
[indistinct chatter]

425
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,804
[delighted exhale]

426
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:58,322
I wouldn't call it a new life,
but it looks like I'll manage to graduate.

427
00:33:58,406 --> 00:34:00,410
-[student 2] Great.
-That's good for now, isn't it?

428
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:01,538
I suppose so.

429
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:03,249
But once Nanmaru retires,

430
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,587
the New Skills Development
Research Society

431
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,173
will start to lose its purpose.

432
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:11,265
That's true. The only person
with a supernatural ability will be gone.

433
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:12,977
I enjoyed our experiments.

434
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,689
-Me too.
-Right.

435
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:16,108
[student 3] So true.

436
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,866
[student 2] What should we do
about the broadcast after Nanmaru retires?

437
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,037
That's a good question.

438
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,876
[student 3] We may as well
switch to a ramen broadcast.

439
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,378
-[student 4] Ramen?
-[student 5] Huh?

440
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:28,967
That has nothing to do with new skills.
Who would do it?

441
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:30,554
-[student 1] Imamura.
-[Imamura] Why me?

442
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:33,351
[student 2] No, wait, he has to take
his glasses off when he eats ramen.

443
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:35,063
-[Imamura] Hey.
-You've never seen him eat, have you?

444
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:36,482
[Imamura] You promised not to say.

445
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,196
-[student 3] Nobody wants to see it.
-[Imamura] How can you say that?

446
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,325
-What a cruel thing to say.
-[student 4] How dare you!

447
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:44,206
[student 3] Just once.
Please take them off just once.

448
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,876
-Just once?
-[student 3] Yeah.

449
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,761
-Awful.
-[laughter]

450
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:52,973
-[Imamura] So cruel!
-[pops]

You think so?

453
00:34:56,397 --> 00:34:58,985
Never mind that, where's Aki?
Is she not coming?

454
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:01,658
Well, I messaged her,

455
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:02,952
but she never messaged back.

456
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,252
-So she's finally had enough of us.
-No way.

I want your help.

460
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:22,867
My help?

461
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:26,666
The recent death in Marukawa Town,

462
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,296
and what happened at the seminar…

463
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,509

So work with me.

467
00:35:42,113 --> 00:35:45,996
Play your cards right,
and you could get a promotion.

468
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,877
I'm not exactly after a promotion.

I haven't got a job yet anyway.

[Sachiko] It's not about that!

That's Takashi Higashimaru.
It's all we needed to know.

We should notify the police.

[♪ suspenseful music playing]

525

[Yoriyuki] Takashi, the reason
you can afford to be so carefree

526
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,889
is that you don't know
about Beyond the Window.

[Takashi] Oh. You think so?

[Yoriyuki]
But that's what also makes you free.

529
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,366
It's pitiful not to be free.

530

[Takashi] I think so.

So, what are we doing here today?
This room is great though.

[Yoriyuki] Apparently,
he's weak on tax increases.

It has toyed with people,

used it with care,

604

and worked hard at their job.

605

But…

606
00:47:52,238 --> 00:47:53,575
they failed,

I just… kind of did.

Right. This kind of work can be hard.

It's just, how should I say this?

My world has expanded.

628
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:37,365
In working life,

629
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:41,583
there's so much wisdom,
ingenuity, and thought

630
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:45,674
packed into places that we often overlook.

631
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:48,095
I've been made to realize that.

632
00:49:49,222 --> 00:49:50,893
The history of battle

633
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,149
is about more than dirt or filth.

634
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:57,363
Negative forces
are hidden within prosperity.

635
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,284
What I'm saying is,

636
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,956
arrogance, laziness,
ignorance, and insensitivity

637
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,587
accumulate before our eyes
like trash or dirt.

638
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,927
We have to counter these negative forces

639
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,559
with the positive power of cleaning.

640
00:50:12,686 --> 00:50:14,774
Then we can finally move forward.

641
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:18,907
That's what culture is all about.

642

[Oshita chuckles softly]

643

Positive ingenuity…

644
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:33,018
That's really what it comes down to.

645
00:50:34,104 --> 00:50:36,191
To utilize my ability,

646
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:40,742
I also need sufficient knowledge
and ingenuity to match it.

647
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,711
Nanmaru.

648
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:48,508
You sometimes mention your ability.

649
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:50,136
What do you mean?

00:50:50,637 --> 00:50:53,727

00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,343
[♪ dramatic music playing]

654
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,749
[rustling continues]

655
00:52:01,278 --> 00:52:02,614
[Oshita] The heck is that?

656
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:07,750
A ball of smog?

657
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,216
Your eyes…

658
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:14,722
You might want to close them.

659
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:19,899
[Oshita] What?

660
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,493
[loud pop]

661
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:29,752
[wind howling, gusting]
