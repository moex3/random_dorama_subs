[anchor on TV]
A mysterious large explosion

48
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,467
caused the upper floors of
the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building

49

in Shinjuku to disappear
as if they had been sliced off.

Rescue operations are ongoing,
and over 200 people are reported missing.

The government has hinted that…

Did…

the implementation of security measures

from you, and when I do, it's boring.

335
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:05,055
Surely not…

336
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,604
That's your reason?

337
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:10,900
[Yoriyuki] I needed to experiment.

338
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:15,116
Size, speed…

339
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,955
How much directional accuracy
I could maintain…

340
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,470
I thought you were
more sensible than this.

341
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,562
[Yoriyuki] I thought you might say that.

342
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,570
Anyway…

343
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,246
Thanks for everything.

344
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:44,843
However…

345
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:48,266
in a few minutes, you'll be thinking this…

346
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,399
"Once a person owns a pet,

347
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:55,488
they should bear responsibility
until the end."

348
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,254
[♪ ominous music playing]

349
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,139
Understood.

350
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,486
-Let's move fast.
-[subordinates] Yes, sir.

351
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,706
[elder] He's like a nuclear weapon now.

352
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,252
I must take action.

353
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,843
To the Prime Minister's office! Hurry!

354
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:28,429
[♪ music fades]

355
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:32,647
[loud pop]

356
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:38,491
[wind howling, gusting]

357
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:51,058
-[sirens wailing in distance]
-[helicopter whirring]

358
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,587
[♪ tense music rises]

359
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,311
