just lazing around here?

323
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,250
I mean, it's not laziness, it's, uh…

324
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,500
Huh? [chuckles]

325
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,625
Well, I could see how it seems
like we're doin' nothin'. [laughs]

326
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm sorry to say it like this.

327
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,833
I cannot keep wasting my time
with you all.

328
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,458
[wind gusting]

329

[sighs]

330
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,208
Oh.

331
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,416
Minako, wait.

332
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,875
Could you stick around today?

333
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,833
Spend some time with all of us here?

334
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,208
Why would I do that?

335
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,125
[Akira] Well, you're already here, and

336
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,541
we may be able to assist you.

337
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,750
Yup. Well, that's what
I was gonna offer, huh?

338
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,791
-[chuckles] Every time.
-Is that so?

339
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,291
-[church bell rings]
-[Michael] Oh, it's late.

340
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,666
-[all exclaim]
-[Kaori] It's time. Hurry up, eat. Here.

341
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,041
-[Michael] Oh!
-Mm-hmm.

342
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,291
Mmm! Mmm!
[mouth full] Gonna have a little more.

343
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,125
-Thank you. Mmm!
-[Kaori] Hurry up!

344
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,500
Uh…

345
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,208
-[Shori] So good!
-[Tanaka] All right.

346
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,166
-[Michael] Okay. Thank you.
-[Akira] Okay.

347
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,500
-[Michael] Hmm.
-[Akira] Yes.

348
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,625
[mysterious, emotional music plays]

[lights buzzing]

350
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,000
[Michael] Yo. Hi there. Hey, hey. Hello.

351
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,083
[spits]

352
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,791
For good luck.
We can't start without it, right?

353
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,333
-[chuckles]
-Can't start what?

354
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:14,000
Ah… Every new film,
I'd always do <i>oharai </i>as a ritual.

355
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,333
Michael says he's a film producer.

356
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:21,166
Watch my films some day.
Mind-blowing cinematic journeys.

357
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,958
Th… that theater has the collection.
All my work, yeah?

358
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,791
-[Kaori] Okay, okay! We need to get going.
-Okay? Huh?

359
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:30,375
Oh… Well, all right.
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

[music swells]

362
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,416
[Minako] What is…
What are we all doing here?

363
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,375
[Akira] Ah…

364
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,916
Every single month,
on the night of a new moon,

365
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,541
we all get together and search.

366
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,166
[Minako] What?

367
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,500
[Akira] For whoever it is we want to see.

368
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,583
[Shori] Man, it's weird, isn't it?

369
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,708
I never thought I'd be
around other people after I died.

370
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,083
Yeah!

371
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,833
-[Tanaka] Shori.
-[man] Can you help me…

372
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:57,500
[Tanaka] Trying to make sense
of a contradiction <i>is </i>a contradiction.

373
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,916
-[Michael] Yeah, just there.
-[Kaori] That's very true.

[emotional music continues]

Oh, hey! Hey!

377
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,250
I found them!
Over here, come on! Hey, look.

00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:31,708
[father] I'm sorry…

386
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,375
It's fairly strange.

387
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,000
We died, and yet here we are.

388
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,208
There is no doubt
that we still exist in this world.

389
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:46,208
We exist…

390
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,125
[father] I'm so sorry
I couldn't protect you.

391
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,791
[Michael] Aah… cramping up.

392
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,083
-[Shori sighs]
-[Michael] K… Kaori, how about a beer?

393
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,208
[Kaori] Okay.

394
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,500
-[Michael] Ah…
-[Tanaka] Have a seat.

395
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,750
-[Michael] Ow, my back.
-[Kaori] And this is for Minako.

396
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,166
[Akira] I'll take one too.

397
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,000
[Michael] Oh, that's good!

398
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,583
Here.

399

[Michael sighs]

400
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,416
What'd you think, Minako?

401
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,583
What did…

402
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,958
Well…

403
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:34,125
[Kaori, Akira sigh]

404
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,333
Well, I was…

405
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,916
-[Kaori sighs]
-I'm confused.

406
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,750
That's understandable.

407
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,291
Hey, Minako.

408
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,625
Take heart. Your boyfriend
will get found soon enough.

409
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,583
-Huh?
-[Kaori] Hey!

410
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:48,166
-That's enough out of you. Stop it.
-Eh? What? Why?

411
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,791
It's my son.

[mouths]

413
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,791
[Minako] I…

414
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,166
I have a seven-year-old son, Ryo.
I'm a single mom. He's all alone.

415
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,708
Ryo's safety is…

416
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,708
That's all that really matters.

417
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,916
[inhales]

418
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,583
May I stay with you all?

419
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,625
Just a little while longer?

[emotional music plays]

00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,208
Sure, that's "goo"!

Be our pleasure. [chuckles]

You bet. [chuckling]

00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:33,916
[Shori] "Goo!"

425
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,791
He says "goo." [laughs]

426

[Michael] Hey, come on.

Okay. Over here. We'll make a toast.

Yeah?

-Come in.
-[door closes]

[Minako] Uh… wh… what is all this stuff?

447
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,666
[Akira] Well, I spend a lot of my time
taking notes.

448
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,666
[Minako] Ah…

449
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,208
Eventually, all of this…

450
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:55,041
is going to be collected and published.

451
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,333
Professionally.

452
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,791
Uh-huh…

453
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,083
Is something wrong?

454
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,833
Uh, well…

455
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,500
I'm grateful that I got
a little bit more time here.

456
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,375
-Thank you for making me feel so welcome.
-Uh… of course.

457
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,583
We all remember what it's like.

458
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,125
Are they helping you
find a loved one as well?

459
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,250
No, nothing like that.

460
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,166
I just…

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,333
I just want
to have a record of everything.

462
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
My goal is to share this with the world.

463
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,875
To show everyone
that there's a life after death.

464
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,791
So, then, that is
your unfinished business, then?

465
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,750
Mmm…

466
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,250
I hadn't considered it.

467
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:48,291
Ah. You're looking for the keys, right?

468
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,958
Yeah, feel free to use it any time.

469
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,916
[Minako] Thank you very much.

470
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,666
Good luck. I'm sure he's out there.

471
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,000
Don't worry.

472
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:06,375
And don't…
be afraid to ask us for a hand, okay?

473
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,583
Minako, hey.

474
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,041
Would you… consent to an interview?

475
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,375
I'd be honored to listen to your story.

476
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,500
Sure, if you'd like.

-[Shori] What's up?

480
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,958
[Michael] Oh, nice. Real nice!

481

Really gotten huge. Oh yeah.

A generational lightning rod, you know?

645
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,416
Just outstanding. [laughs]

-[Michael] The poster, right?

647
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,500
Our heroine, Maiko,
standing alone on the beach.

648
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,666
And then, bam! Title up top.

649
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,791
I think we could've gone places with it,
you know?

650
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,916
-Poster was all ready to go, huh?
-Oh, y… you bet, you bet, you bet.

651
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,208
Had it all planned out,
right down to the last detail.

652
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:01,708
Theme, story, the whole bit!

[chuckles]

654
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,916
Tell me, how did… you come to make a movie
about the student protests?

655
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,250
Oh, this ol' thing?

Yeah. Funny… [chuckles]

658
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,375
It's a true story, yeah.

659

-[chuckles]
-It's yours?

660
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:20,125
Well, it's not totally true,
but I was at that uprising, and…

661
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,458
maybe you agree, maybe not,
but… regardless,

662
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:25,708
m… messaging aside, there was unity there.

663
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,500
Film is like that.

00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,041
Man. [chuckles]

[Minako sighs]

00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,708
Film is really your love, isn't it?

Mmm.

Mm-hmm.

If it's an autobiography,

671
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,583
then Maiko was really
<i>your </i>college sweetheart?

672
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,291
Could be. [chuckles]

673
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,166
My, my. I guess you figured it out.

674

-[laughs]
-So what happened to you after that?

Mmm, uh…

959
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,375
-Hey. Did you know…
-Mmm?

960
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,625
Back in the '70s, I made yoga popular.

961
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:35,583
-No way!
-Oh boy!

962
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:37,875
-There we go.
-Oh yeah. 30 years ago, right?

963
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,125
-I was working mostly in advertising.
-Oh!

964
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:45,000
-A big fitness boom was sweeping Japan!
-Without Shori, no one can stop him.

965
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:47,083
-This could be rough. Oh! Nana.
-Correct.

966
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,000
-[Michael] I made it popular…
-[Minako] Morning.

967
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,208
[Michael] Morning.

968
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,333
Hey, where's the yakuza?

969
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:53,625
Well…

970
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,333
Shori has gone.

971
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,458
He's beyond us.

972
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,416
You aren't making sense.

973
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:07,291
[Minako] Do you have any regrets
or unfinished business

974
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:08,875
from when you were alive?

975
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,166
[Nana] What?

976
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:14,291
I'll bet that's the reason
you're still here with us.

977
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,875
You sound crazy. Is this a kind of cult?

978
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,500
Come now, a cult? You're really so rude.

979
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,125
Hey, Nana.

980
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:26,958
Would you… like to shoot a movie?

981
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,666
-[Akira] Minako.
-Creep.

982
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,083
-[Michael] What?
-[Akira] Let's go?

983
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,041
Oh, sure.

984
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:34,083
[Kaori] Hey, Nana, sit over there.

985
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,208
DECEASED

986
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,250
[Minako] Every day,
I'm scared to look through this.

987
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,625
If Ryo's name is in here,

988
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,708
what's going to happen to me?

989
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,958
I understand.

990
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,208
Uh, so… you'd like an interview.
That right?

991
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,000
[Akira] Sure.

992
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:12,333
I'd like to ask you just a few questions
before your soul goes to the other side.

993
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,708
Well…

994
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,708
Kawakami Minako. 35 years old.

995
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:22,125
Here at the station,
I worked as a journalist.

996
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:25,083
And I was a single mother to my child.

997
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,291
And your husband?

998
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,791
We split up soon after I had Ryo.

999
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,833
When I wanted to return to work,
he just didn't understand it.

1000
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,291
Since then, it's just us two.

1001
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,125
Minako, I'd like to know.

1002
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,083
How was your time in this existence?

1003
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,666
-You mean in the living world?
-Yes.

1004
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,958
[sighs] I don't quite know.

1005
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,875
It was hectic to work and raise a child.

1006
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:05,666
I probably didn't have to be
trying so hard back then.

1007
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,625
If you went back today, what would you do?

1008
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,125
Ryo and I…

1009
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,708
-[poignant music plays]
-I would take us on vacation.

1010
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,291
He's never had that chance.

1011
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:33,666
And…

1012
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:38,125
And then I want to apologize.

1013
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:52,750
[man] Many things in nature are
invisible to the naked eye.

1014
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,625
Things like atoms, electrons,
elementary particles.

1015
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,208
-They still have mysteries.
-So stupid.

1016
01:07:57,291 --> 01:08:00,875
-[man] We experience three dimensions…
-[girl 2] Loser. She keeps apologizing.

1017
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,500
-[girl 2] I have to watch it again.
-[girl 3] She's so sad.

1018
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,458
[all giggling]

1019
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,083
-[man] Lisa Randall proposed…
-[girl 3] So going viral.

1020
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,875
-[man] …theory of five dimensions…
-Genius, Rina.

1021
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,750
-[man] Some research suggests as many…
-[girl 1] I think it's best!

1022
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,583
-[man] …as 11 dimensions.
-[girl 1] Do Yasuko.

1023
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:17,041
-[man] This has yet to be widely accepted.
-[girl 1] Yasuko!

1024
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:19,958
-[man] It's clear there is far more…
-Please don't slit your wrists.

1025
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:22,791
-It's played out at this point.
-[man] …to our world than meets the eye.

1026
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:24,833
-There's much more to be learned.
-[girls giggling]

1027
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:26,666
Hey. Over there, are you keepin' up?

1028
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,166
-[girls] Yes!
-[Rina] Yes, I'm sorry.

1029
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:32,000
[teacher] Okay, so in review,
what is a dimension?

1030
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:37,208
Um, it is defined as a measurement
of space in any one direction.

1031
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,458
-[thud]
-Okay? So one dimension.

1032
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:42,958
-[giggling continues]
-One would be what? Correct, it is a line.

1033
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:44,666
[Michael] Sure.

1034
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,958
-[Kaori] Okay, dessert is served.
-[Akira] Thank you, Kaori.

1035
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:52,458
-[Nana] Hey.
-Oh, hey, Nana.

1036
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,583
I do understand that I died…

1037
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:58,583
[breathing shakily]

1038
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:01,875
Can we kill others?

1039
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,916
There's this girl I want to kill.

1040
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:09,375
Hey, Nana.

1041
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,166
Not good karma to say things like that.

1042
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:16,500
Those on our side and those on their side
aren't going to affect each other.

1043
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,166
[Nana shudders]

1044
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,958
That's stupid.

1045
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:26,583
Sounds like this just sucks.

1046
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,000
Hey…

1047
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:42,375
[Minako sighs]

1048
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:44,958

01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:55,125
[sighs]

1050
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:58,500
I couldn't even taste that.

1051
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:02,291
How long am I going to be stuck?

1052
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,500
I shouldn't be here! I just wanna be gone.

1053
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,708
[Nana breathing shakily]

-[Nana sighs]
-[Minako] Nana…

1058
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,541
How about we go on a walk together?

1059
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:29,208
I wanna show you something.

1060
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:31,958
[sighs] What?

1061
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:35,208
It's better in person. Just tag along.

1062
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,333
[gentle, emotional music plays]

1063
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,708
[Michael] Hah! Yes! Let's go.

1064
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,625
Hmm!

1065
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,125
[Nana] Huh?

1066
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,041
What is this?

1067
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,250
[Minako] All of us died,
leaving unfinished business

1068
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,625
and our closest loved ones behind.

1069
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:28,625
So we band together every month.

1070
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,750
Searching as a group.

1071
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,458
Our closest…

1072
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:42,291
Nana, I don't know what your regret is.
However…

1073
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,375
we'll help you find it, okay?

1074
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,208
[man] Hey! Over here, over here.

1075
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,166
I'm sorry.

1076
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,041
I'm so sorry.

1077
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,416
[music swells]

1078
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,958
-Oh my God!
-Dude, dude!

1079
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,708
-Right? What now?
-So weird!

1080
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:23,041
-What does it say?
-"I do not have the energy…"

1081
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:24,916
Oh wow! Yeah, that's a lot.

1082
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,416
[sighs]

1083
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:40,208
I think that…

1084
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,916
there's someone I should say sorry to.

1085
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:49,625
[sighs]

1086
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:04,375
[music fades]

1087
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,541
[doctor] And here we see the baby's face.

1088
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,541
-[gasps]
-[doctor] Oh, and there's the eyes.

1089
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,125
-[father] Oh, yeah.
-[doctor] The mouth.

1090
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:13,625
[Kaori] I couldn't accept dying
before seeing my daughter give birth.

1091
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:16,708
-The baby seems healthy!
-[Kaori] I fought my destiny. Here I am.

1092
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,458
-The world's lenient about this.
-It's a boy.

1093
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:20,875
[Kaori's daughter] A girl!

1094
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,791
-Aw, she's so beautiful!
-Apparently, that is the case.

1095
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:24,875
[daughter] Yeah.

1096
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:28,583
I'm lucky to have
gotten the time that I did.

1097
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:31,000
[daughter chuckles] I'm fine! Yeah, it's…

1098
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:33,208
It's… it's incredible.

1099
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:35,666
-This was my last regret.
-[daughter] Mm-hmm.

1100
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,500
Yeah. I…

1101
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:40,875
I never wanted anything more.

1102
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,291
Through all those years
I got with the kids, I realized…

1103
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,333
they are tough.

1104
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,833
-[daughter] Aw.
-[chuckles] I'm sure that…

1105
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:55,541
they would've been okay on their own
all these years.

1106
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:56,750
[daughter] Yeah…

1107
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,333
I think about that now and then.

1108
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,041
-[daughter] Do you know how long?
-That's not true at all.

1109
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:20,125
DAY 32, NOTHING ON SHELTER'S NOTICEBOARD
HOKUTO TV, NO PROGRESS

01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,458
[footsteps approaching]

1111
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,500
Oh my, what is this?

1112
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,291
My goodness, Michael. Hey!

1113
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,625
Come on,
you don't want to sleep here, do you?

1114
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,666
-[grumbling]
-Okay, let's go to your room, yeah?

1115
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,833
-Mr. Tanaka, give me a hand.
-[Tanaka] Sure.

1116
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:35,416
[sighs] Come on, wake up.

1117
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,250
-[grunts]
-Michael, hey. Yep.

1118
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,666
-Okay, there. One, two… Mmph!
-Okay, come on, you.

1119
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:40,916
-Okay, here.
-What's goin' on?

1120
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,083
-Stop. Okay…
-When did you drink this much?

1121
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:46,500
-What happened? [laughs]
-[Tanaka] We'll be back. Yes, yes. Got it.

1122
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,333
[Akira chuckles softly]

1123
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:56,666
How's it been goin'?

1124
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,625
Good. I enjoy writing.

1125
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:04,083
But I can't quite manage the end.

1126
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:14,791
I thought I could ask you some questions.
Is that okay?

1127
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,791
No, no, no. [laughs]

1128
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,625
Maybe I'm just not interesting.

1129
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:23,375
[laughs] Whenever things turn to you,
you dodge the questions.

1130
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:24,791
Is that so? Well…

1131
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:29,583
I'll just listen.
I'd guess you have an interesting story.

1132
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,250
Minako, um,

1133
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,041
I'm sensing that journalism in you.

1134
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:40,250
[both laugh]

1135
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,916
-That's true!
-Mmm.

1136
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,416
[Minako giggles]

1137
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,666
I suppose…

1138
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,583
I guess there's no harm in you knowing.

1139
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,208
The reason why

1140
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,250
I can't go to the other side.

1141
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,041
[birdsong]

[cows mooing]

1143
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,041
[Minako] Is this… where you grew up?

1144
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,083
[Akira] Yeah.

1145
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,500
Dad looks as stubborn
as those cows, right?

1146
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,875
I was always… let's say, infirm as a kid.

1147
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:43,250
Dad was always the most
frightening guy in the world.

1148
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,625
Your <i>bento </i>always stinks.

1149

-[girl 2] Is she picking them up?

1151
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,958
-[girl 1] So sad!
-[girl 2] Ew!

1152
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:07,583
-[girl 3] She's like a dog!
-[girl 2] What's she doing?

1153
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,541
-[girl 3] What the hell?
-Um, is she eating that?

1154
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,708
[girl 2] What? Really?

1155
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,958
-She is, that's nasty!
-[girl 1] Ew, no!

1156
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:14,083
-What a freak.
-Bye, Yasuko!

1157
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,833
-Ew, ew, ew.
-[girl 3] So creepy!

1158
01:17:15,916 --> 01:17:18,250
[girl 2] I think something got on me.
Nasty!

1159
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,625
-Is she contagious?
-Are you okay?

1160
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,208
Nana…

1161
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:49,041
[sniffles]

1162
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:52,833
Yasuko!

1163
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,750
Yasuko! Yasuko, I'm sorry!

1164

[poignant music plays]

1168
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:10,125
[sobbing] Why'd you go? I needed you…

1169
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:15,583
Nana…

1170
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:29,416
-Nana, why did you…
-Please, Yasuko… I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1171
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,750
-I just want it to stop…
-Yasuko…

1172
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:38,000
-I'm sorry, Yasuko, I'm sorry.
-Nana…

1173
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,458
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1174
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,250
Why?

1175
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,208
-Nana…
-I love you…

1176
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:47,291
[sobbing]

Nana…

1178
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:00,833
[Akira] I practically lived in my bed.

1179
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:06,416
Imagine being the son of a rancher
and saying that you can't work. [chuckles]

1180
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,041
I always thought

1181
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:18,041
my dad could never see me as
much of a son because of all of that.

1182
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,125
When I was given just days to live,

1183
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,541
I thought, "Why me?"

1184
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:44,958
And then I began taking
it out on all of them.

1185
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:49,416
I've hurt them a lot.

1186
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,041
[footsteps approaching]

1187
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,583
I believe that's…

1188
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:25,333
most likely why I can't
go on to the world beyond.

1189
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,833
[gentle, emotional music plays]

[scribbling]

1191
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,375
He's worked on this novel
every day for years.

1192
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:45,875
He decided to write a story
about me, even though, well,

1193
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,583
books aren't his interest.

1194
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,041
If I was still around…

1195
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:00,875
maybe he wouldn't be writing a novel.

1196
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:06,791
Or he could've been.
I guess I'll never really know.

1197
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:13,500
I'm glad he's doing it though.

1198
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:20,916
It feels like I've gotten to know him
for the first time.

AKIRA CHEERED ON THE NEWBORN CALF…

But…

01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,666
if I had known about it
when I was still alive…

Hey, Nana.

1207
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,666
[sighs] It's chaos in here.

1208
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,333
Oh, sorry.

1209
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,375
[Nana] What are you writing?

1210
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:24,166
Ah… Well, since I got here,
I've been keeping a record.

1211
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,583
Everything that happens.

1212
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:27,666
[Nana] Oh, yeah?

1214

Something wrong?

[sighs] You know…

1216
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:47,166
I apologized.

1217

Even so,

1218
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:54,375
nothing has changed.

1219
01:22:57,958 --> 01:22:58,958
Why is that?

1220
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,875
I'm sure that one day…

1221
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:11,916
your voice is going to be heard.

1222
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:16,000
Don't worry.

1223
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,958
-That's not really an answer.

Hmm.

Ah…

1226
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,666

01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:47,541
We have the theater.
We should just screen it.

1584
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,250
People are bound to be interested.

1585
01:48:55,416 --> 01:48:57,625
Ooh, hey! [chuckles]

1586
01:48:57,708 --> 01:49:00,208
That's what I was about to s… suggest.
That's a great idea though.

1587
01:49:00,291 --> 01:49:01,916
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

1588
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:04,041
-Let's do it.
-[Akira] Let's do it!

1589
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:06,125
-[Michael] We're doing this!
-[Tanaka] Great!

1590
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:19,333
[murmur of voices]

1591
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:26,125
Michael, we're all set. Mm-hmm.

1592
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:39,875
[coughs]

1593
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,625
[sighs]

1594
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:46,166
Um…

1595
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:51,000
G… good evening, everyone.
M… my name is Michael.

1596
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:55,000
With the help of my great friends,

1597
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:58,000
we have finally completed this film.

1598
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,791
Well… t… this film is actually, well…

1599
01:50:03,375 --> 01:50:06,916
It can truly move generations
and inspire revolution

1600
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,583
while being a conduit that connects
the past to the present and future.

1601
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:12,583
Mmm.

1602
01:50:14,833 --> 01:50:16,541
Uh… uh…

1603
01:50:18,291 --> 01:50:21,291
Still directing, even after I've died.

1604
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:24,500
-[laughter]
-[Michael] That was pointed out to me.

1605
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:27,875
But I tend to think
that fortune favors the bold.

1606
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:30,166
Please, everyone,

1607
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:32,791
enjoy the movie.

1608
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:58,125
[sighs]

1609
01:50:58,208 --> 01:51:00,208
[fingers tapping]

1610
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:11,125
[gentle ambient music plays]

1611
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:13,666
[Minako chuckles]

1612
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,250
[Michael chuckles]

1613
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:21,125
[projector whirring]

1614
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:25,708
[waves rushing]

[music fades]

1616
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,291
[Michael] You know…

1617
01:52:00,916 --> 01:52:03,166
So, for the next feature…

1618
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:05,291
-You have more ideas?
-[Michael laughs]

1619
01:52:05,875 --> 01:52:07,291
Well, the next chapter…

1620
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:10,541
On the years that I've b… been here.

1621
01:52:11,208 --> 01:52:13,416
Something I'd like to try. [laughs]

1622
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,708
Hey, Michael. I had that idea too.

1623
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:17,250
-[Nana] Really?
-[Michael] Well!

1624
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:19,208
Well, let's do it together!

1625
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:22,083
If you thought this last one
was a masterpiece…

1626
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:24,041
I can't allow that. [chuckles]

1627
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:25,833
-[all chuckling]
-[Michael] Okay.

1628
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,250
Minako.

1629
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,458
-Are you okay?
-Uh, yes.

1630
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:37,166
It just

1631
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:40,375
hasn't sunk in yet. [sighs]

1632
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:43,625
I understand that.

1633
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:44,750
[wistful music plays]

1634
01:52:44,833 --> 01:52:50,125
To be honest, I was feeling…
pretty uneasy about it too. [chuckles]

1635
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:52,708
Hey, Tanaka.

1636
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:54,125
-[Tanaka] Yes?
-Uh…

1637
01:52:54,208 --> 01:52:56,833
Can you tell us anything
about the other side?

1638
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,375
I am afraid I cannot.

1639
01:53:01,291 --> 01:53:02,166
Huh?

1640
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:06,041
So, Tanaka… Think of him as a marshal.

1641
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:11,666
Nobody said anything? That's so scary.

1642
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:12,833
[all laughing]

1643
01:53:12,916 --> 01:53:15,583
W… won't you just tell us already?
Come on.

1644
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:17,250
You will learn soon enough.

1645
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:20,791
-[Kaori] Aah!
-Tanaka, why are you being so stubborn?

1646
01:53:20,875 --> 01:53:21,875
[laughs]

1647
01:53:25,458 --> 01:53:26,583
But you know what?

1648
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:29,666
The show was fun. I had a good time.

1649
01:53:38,291 --> 01:53:39,333
I know!

1650
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:42,958
There's nothing like filmmaking.

1651
01:53:44,291 --> 01:53:49,500
Us… full-grown adults at play,
working towards this story…

1652
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:51,833
-It… it's phenomenal!
-[Minako laughs]

1653
01:53:51,916 --> 01:53:53,250
-It is.
-[Michael] Right?

1654
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:56,416
Now… Nana.

1655
01:53:58,125 --> 01:53:59,791
Keep making more movies.

1656
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:03,041
Th… there's notes in my room
that you can use.

1657
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,708
Nana, you're going to be great!

1658
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:07,250
[laughs] Why's it only me?

1659
01:54:08,791 --> 01:54:09,833
[Michael] Akira.

1660
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:14,125
Everything else is up to you.

1661
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:23,166
It is essential that you continue
to document this world.

1662
01:54:25,875 --> 01:54:27,583
I promise that I will.

1663
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:33,291
But you always have to stay
on the offensive.

1664
01:54:33,375 --> 01:54:36,000
-Never let your guard down!
-Who's he competing with?

1665
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:44,375
[Michael] Hmm. Well.

1666
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:47,875
Let's have a toast. <i>Kanpai. </i>Mmm?

1667
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:48,833
-Ting!
-[Akira] Sure.

1668
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:50,208
[Michael] Yes! Let's toast.

1669
01:54:56,083 --> 01:54:57,666
[Kaori sighs heavily]

1670
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:00,250
<i>Kanpai.</i>

1671
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:02,500
[all] <i>Kanpai.</i>

1672
01:55:02,583 --> 01:55:04,291
[glasses clinking]

1673
01:55:13,833 --> 01:55:15,708
Aah…

1674
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:21,791
Well, we have plenty of food left.

1675
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:23,541
-So eat up.
-[Michael] Oh.

1676
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:25,916
-[Tanaka] Yeah, let's eat.
-[Akira] All right.

1677
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:28,333
[Tanaka] Could you pass me some <i>kinpira?</i>

1678
01:55:29,291 --> 01:55:30,958
-[Nana] This one?
-[Tanaka] That one.

1679
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:34,750
-[Akira] You want chicken?
-[Tanaka] Oh, just one, please.

1680
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:37,041
-Yes, thank you.
-[Akira] Sure.

1681
01:55:37,125 --> 01:55:38,583
-[Tanaka] And…
-[Akira] Ah, the fries.

1682
01:55:38,666 --> 01:55:40,083
-[Tanaka] Thanks.
-[Akira] This much?

1683
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:42,000
[Tanaka] Yes, thank you. A bit more.

1684
01:55:42,083 --> 01:55:44,208
-[Akira] A little more?
-[Tanaka] Yes, thank you.

1685
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,875
-[Akira] What can I get you?
-[Nana] Not <i>kinpira.</i>

1686
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:48,291
[Tanaka, Akira laugh]

1687
01:55:49,125 --> 01:55:50,833
-[Nana] Why laugh?
-[Minako] It's nothing.

1688
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:53,125
-[Akira] Here. Anything else?
-[Nana] Just…

1689
01:55:56,291 --> 01:55:58,291

Knock, knock.

1694
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:37,458
[Akira] Everyone else went to sleep?

1695
01:56:37,958 --> 01:56:39,041
[Minako] Yeah.

1696
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:42,500
Seems like Michael fell asleep
while all of us were talking.

1697
01:56:42,583 --> 01:56:43,750
[Akira chuckles]

1698
01:56:43,833 --> 01:56:46,125
That guy has so much energy.

1699
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:47,750
[Minako sighs]

1700
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:55,666
-Here.
-Thanks.

[sighs]

1704
01:57:07,625 --> 01:57:10,000
Akira, do you really plan to keep writing?

1705
01:57:11,208 --> 01:57:12,041
Yeah.

1706
01:57:13,166 --> 01:57:16,375
At least until Dad finishes his book.
Then I might stop.

1707
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,083
I see.

1708
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:21,291
Don't forget to put me in there.

1709
01:57:21,916 --> 01:57:22,958
Of course.

1710
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,541
I think I'll turn you
into the main character.

1711
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:28,500
-Oh, no, don't! That's okay.
-[laughs]

1712
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:30,791
Just a little part. [giggles]

1713
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:37,375
I was really wishing…

1714
01:57:39,166 --> 01:57:40,833
that you could stay longer.

1715
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:44,041
[laughs] Where'd this come from?

1716
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,500
I kinda have…

1717
01:57:51,083 --> 01:57:52,458
a little crush.

1718
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:56,791
-[gentle music plays]
-What's with this confession?

1719
01:57:58,291 --> 01:57:59,708
-Was it strange?
-[laughs]

1720
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:01,333
Yes, it's strange.

1721
01:58:01,416 --> 01:58:02,958
[both chuckle]

1722
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:07,416
I wonder how things would have gone

1723
01:58:08,708 --> 01:58:10,916
if we had known each
other a little earlier.

1724
01:58:12,166 --> 01:58:13,916
"Coulda, woulda, shoulda," right?

1725
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:17,958
That's right. [sighs]

1726
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:21,750
Akira.

1727
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:26,208
Thank you.

1728
01:58:26,708 --> 01:58:28,208
I've had a good time.

1729
01:58:35,291 --> 01:58:36,250
So have I.

1730
01:58:37,791 --> 01:58:38,875
Thank you, Minako.
