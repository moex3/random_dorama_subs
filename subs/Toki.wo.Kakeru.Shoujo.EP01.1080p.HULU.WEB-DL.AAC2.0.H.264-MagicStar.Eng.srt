1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,279
Summer...

2
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,216
I hate it.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,553
I used to like it before,

4
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,990
but I started to hate it
since attending middle school.

5
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,993
It's a nuisance when you sweat,
right?

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,563
I even wanted to go to school naked.

7
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,999
Amazing!

8
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,134
We're here!

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,169
No, not naked.

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,571
It takes so much trouble
to get rid of my body hair.

11
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:41,108
Like hair on your arms, armpits,
the back...You name it.

12
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,010
You do it for
the most absurd reasons

13
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,112
and like you're worried that
others might see it.

14
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,755
Things like flying in the sky
or reading people's mind...

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,691
I don't believe in superpowers,

16
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,628
but if I can have one,

17
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,697
I want one that will let me get rid
of my body hair at once!

18
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,235
Watch out!

19
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,072
Gosh, you must be kidding...

20
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:14,875
What, it's stupid?

21
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,612
But it's still more useful than
bending a spoon.

22
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,693
What is this?

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,297
I think it's a giant oarfish.

24
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,998
I'm in my third year in high school
before I knew it.

25
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,134
I'm old already.

26
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,903
My friends, parents and teachers

27
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,238
keep talking about college
entry exam.

28
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,774
Yeah, all right, I'll do it soon!

29
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,110
But there are things that
I have to do now...

30
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,011
Maybe not.

31
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,447
What? How boring!

32
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,583
It's my last summer in high school!

33
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,117
You lost the potion?

34
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,253
You mean we can't go back?

35
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,888
It's not totally impossible...Hey!

36
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,457
No way...

37
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:05,459
I've made up my mind!

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,929
I'll enjoy this summer
to the fullest extent.

39
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,501
Oh, hang on.

40
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,504
I thought it was too quiet
and you're gone.

41
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,273
Where have you gone to?

42
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,844
Come on, don't just leave me here
and go away.

43
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,012
You're so mean.

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,915
What are you doing in my home?

45
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,063
Hey...Seriously, where are you?

46
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,298
Just the right amount...

47
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,133
Don't go somewhere far away.

48
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,904
I'm lonely. It hurts.

49
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,507
Please don't. Wait...
We'll meet again, right?

50
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,843
No...I'm scared...Please!

51
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,445
Come back...

52
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:00,981
Who is there?

53
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,883
Is someone in there?

54
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,165
What is this?

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,035
The smell...

56
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,583
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

57
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,863
I like the barber more than
a hair salon.

58
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,667
It feels so good
to have my face shaved.

59
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,736
Girls do grow a moustache, too.

60
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,638
It's fine hair like peach fuzz.

61
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,576
You don't have to see if I grow any.

62
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,714
What the heck?

63
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,450
Don't tell me...

64
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,087
Goro, you fancy me?

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,457
Even if I do this?

66
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,127
No way!

67
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,064
You've got to be kidding!

68
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,235
Ouch!

69
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,006
Gosh, my hairstyle is horrible!

70
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,175
You had it cut in the hair salon
yesterday, right?

71
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,345
I did try to stop you, though.

72
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,650
It doesn't suit me at all!

73
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,320
Today is 7th July,
the Star Festival.

74
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,956
Perhaps you would like to write your
wish on strips of paper...

75
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,325
I can't go to school
wearing this hairstyle!

76
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,095
Why? It's cute, like a helmet.

77
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,530
But helmets make you look stupid!

78
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,366
...a giant oarfish was found

79
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,502
here on the Fujiura Coast,
Shizuoka Prefecture.

80
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,971
Oh? The Fujiura Coast
is just round the corner, right?

81
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,374
Isn't that girl from Higashi High
School like you, Mihane?

82
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,878
Wow, she is on TV and the whole
nation is watching it.

83
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,346
Something horrible might happen...

84
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,380
I've finished breakfast.

85
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,082
...and this could be the sign.

86
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,218
- See you.
- Okay, see you.

87
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,287
The ice-cream in the freezer
is mine.

88
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,923
You'll swallow a thousand needles
if you eat it.

89
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,027
Mihane, you'll be late for school
if you don't hurry.

90
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,963
I said, I'm not going to school.

91
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,664
What? Really?

92
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,033
You've never taken a sick leave
since kindergarten!

93
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,071
I didn't know I was digging my
own grave by being healthy.

94
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,042
Bon appetit.

95
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,244
Mom!

96
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,279
Where is my camera?

97
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,782
What? I have no idea.

98
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:58,786
Where is it...

99
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,089
Oh! It is here!

100
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,958
Let's go!

101
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,960
Good morning...

102
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,966
Good morning...

103
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,741
Your hairstyle is great.
It suits you.

104
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,342
You're lying, but thanks anyway.

105
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,112
It's true! But my dad would be sad,

106
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,615
if he knows you stop coming to our
barber shop to have your hair cut.

107
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,651
I'm fed up with hair salons.

108
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,554
I'll go to Barber Asakura
to have my hair cut next time!

109
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,022
All right. Let's go!

110
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,126
- Go without me.
- What?

111
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,295
I'll get my gas tank filled.

112
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,330
Gas tank?

113
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,537
Did you cut it for me?

114
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,207
Because I said I liked
girls who wear a mushroom haircut?

115
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,510
Of course not...

116
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,358
Hey...

117
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,960
Your gas tank...

118
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,329
I filled it with
high-octane gasoline today!

119
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,230
High-octane?

120
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,066
What do you mean? What high-octane?

121
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,237
- Five more minutes.
- Five more?

122
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,738
Good morning...

123
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,541
Hey, you like guys like him?

124
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,711
Yes! I like handsome guys like him!

125
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:31,845
- You like that kind of guys?
- Yes!

126
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,547
Oh, Goro!

127
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,085
Goro, what are you doing?

128
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,824
I'm sorry...

129
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,627
Sorry, I'll go to
the classroom later.

130
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,861
You dropped the flowers.

131
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,798
Please forgive her.
I'll lecture her later. Sorry.

132
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,067
Let's go!

134
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,669
Why did you make him angry?

135
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,272
I just bumped into him...

136
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,375
I bumped into him because
I was calling your name...

137
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,710
Weird? What do you mean?

138
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,913
- It's round, like...
- You mean mushroom?

139
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,047
- Yeah...
- What?

140
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,082
Good morning...

141
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,820
Your hairstyle is lovely!

142
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,923
- It really suits you.
- You've cut pretty much.

143
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,257
- Yeah, I have.
- It really suits you.

144
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,760
Good morning.

145
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,795
- Good morning.
- What the heck?

146
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,364
Good...morning.

147
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:25,999
You got your hair cut.

148
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,168
You look like a Kokeshi doll.

149
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,137
Kokeshi doll!

150
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,873
- Calm down!
- Well done, Shohei, it's so funny.

151
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,079
I knew Shohei would make
a fool of me.

152
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,581
This is a bit too bad.

153
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,553
The trick to solving this question

154
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,424
is to divide it with
the denominator's inverse number.

155
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,826
3 minus 1 is 2,

156
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,495
so you times it by 1 over 2,
and this...

157
00:09:55,963 --> 00:10:00,133
is the trick of doing
a partial fraction decomposition.

158
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,134
Got it?

159
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,403
Now, let's do a similar question
after this.

160
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,273
Let's see who should I get
to do it...

161
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,782
Mihane Yoshiyama!

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,003
Girls in their swimsuits are lovely,
but let's do maths now.

163
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,537
Where is your textbook?

164
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,011
You must have brought
a notebook, right?

165
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,121
I only have this...

166
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,923
My, my. How romantic...You idiot!

167
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,426
- What have you come to school for?
- Sorry.

168
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,495
Darn.

169
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,838
Mihane Yoshiyama.

170
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,575
Why does that dying message mean?

171
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,482
I think it means this question
cannot be solved...

172
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,553
But it actually reads, "Please give
me some special questions."

173
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,990
No, thank you...

174
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,862
I told him I want to break up
and I was serious.

175
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,199
But we ended up kissing.

176
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,868
What? Why did you end up kissing?

177
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,538
Then we kept kissing for 2.5 hours
until we went to cram school.

178
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,673
My lips got chapped.

179
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,676
Oh, you're really a grown-up,
Erichin!

180
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,012
I want a boyfriend, too!

181
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,915
But I don't want you to have
a boyfriend, Ojo.

182
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,451
And you, Mihane?

183
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,288
Are you going to the Star Festival
event with Asakura this year, too?

184
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,860
Yeah, I guess.

185
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,795
We do that every year.

186
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,964
Will Asakura wear his yukata?

187
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,569
I want be held in his arms, tightly.

188
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,205
Oh, he's so handsome...

189
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:23,076
Why do high school girls love
talking about boys? It's awful...

190
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,747
You said the college student at the
convenient store was cool, right?

191
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,753
Well...That...It's not like
I have a crush on him...

192
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,087
It's like filling a gas tank.

193
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,956
- Really?
- I really don't!

194
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,996
- Congratulations!
- Wow.

195
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,531
Give Yoshiyama a round of applause!

196
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,700
Aphrodite is smashed into pieces...

197
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,637
I am sorry!

198
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,272
I'm thirsty...

199
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,241
My luck seems to be bad today.

200
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,631
- I'll go to throw away the rubbish.
- Okay.

201
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,733
- Put the stools down.
- Got it.

202
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,941
She's so cute! Let's take a photo...

203
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,677
- Okay, say cheese!
- She's so cute!

204
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,621
Who is there?

205
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,068
Is someone in there?

206
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,327
What is it?

207
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,796
This smell...

208
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,815
There is just no man who can
make my heart skip a beat.

209
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,551
Then...What about Mr. Yano?

210
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,620
Mr. Yano?

211
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,857
He's too loud, and I'm fed up with
his "chic-ish" shirts.

212
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,659
- Don't tell him, though.
- Okay.

213
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,297
How are you feeling? The boys are
waiting here and they're worried.

214
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,166
Worried? But you were gossiping
about love and crushes.

215
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,802
Why were you having a nap
in the lab's storage room?

216
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,837
I wasn't having a nap!

217
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,175
A sweet aroma came from
a broken test tube,

218
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,712
I was wondering what it was and when
I inhaled it, I felt dizzy...

219
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,747
Was there a broken test tube?

220
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,115
- No, there wasn't.
- What?

221
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,618
Only you passed out there.

222
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,752
What?

223
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:56,423
But there were broken flasks,
beakers...And it was a mess, right?

224
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,692
Someone was doing an experiment.

225
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,628
- Then I turned them over...
- I told you,

226
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,595
there weren't any.

227
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,064
- Right, Shohei?
- What?

228
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,866
- There was absolutely nothing.
- You see?

229
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,704
Enough of that.
Are you really okay, Mihane?

230
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,506
Have you felt any changes
in your body?

231
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:23,717
What's the matter?

232
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:25,819
What?

233
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,656
I'm starving...

234
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,192
Gosh, you're ridiculous!

235
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,626
- This is horrible.
- Let's go!

236
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,898
Our conclusion is, she got anemia
and she was starving,

237
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,034
so she experienced an hallucination.

238
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,636
Gosh, you two are so mean!

239
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,939
They asked whether my brain was okay
to have my college entry exam or not

240
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,841
and told me to have it checked.

241
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,009
Oh, you'll have your
college entry exam?

242
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,112
It feels like you've just
entered your high school.

243
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,214
Time flies.

244
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,816
Our Keita is in primary 3 now.

245
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,886
I have to write what
I want to do after graduation...

246
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,721
What should I write?

247
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,656
You'll succeed the barber's,
won't you, Goro?

248
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,593
But my parents told me to
go to college.

249
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,696
Just pursue your dream.
It's your own life after all.

250
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,398
He studies arts,

251
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,500
but his marks are high enough
to enter a medical school.

252
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,803
Go and be a doctor. A scalpel earns
you more than a pair of scissors.

253
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,004
Come on!

254
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,105
That's not what you just said.

255
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,542
Hang on. Have we asked Shohei what
he wants to do after graduation?

256
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,943
That reminds me. No.

257
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,313
I'll go to a pharmaceutical
research center.

258
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,317
- That's your dream?
- No, it's not a dream.

259
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,587
It's just because my DNA makes me
suitable for this.

260
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,757
Your DNA makes you
suitable for that?

261
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,093
- Wow, what the heck?
- It's so cool.

262
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,196
So, what does your DNA make you
suitable to be?

263
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,365
What?

264
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:51,004
A guy and a lady suddenly appeared
on the boat?

265
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,006
Don't make up stories.

266
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,608
I'm telling the truth!
They appeared yesterday.

267
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,744
Why don't you remember it?

268
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,779
Are you still taking photos?

269
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,415
I don't know what to photograph

270
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,919
and the photos my friends take with
their smartphones look prettier.

271
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,790
I haven't got any talent.
It's frustrating.

272
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,868
Do you know her?
She goes to our high school.

273
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,002
Atsumi Onishi, right?

274
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,704
She's an internet idol,

275
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,507
and this incident got everyone
really excited on the internet.

276
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,942
Why?

277
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,779
"The idol of miracles, whom the
Dragon Palace sent a messenger to."

278
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,382
She just found a deep sea fish
that was washed ashore.

279
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,918
But idols nowadays need
a catchphrase.

280
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,955
I heard the girls in Class 2
suddenly became friendly to her.

281
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,357
Right after she got famous.

282
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,630
I want to get famous, too!

283
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,700
If it was some years ago,
you might have been popular,

284
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,969
because you are cute.

285
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,674
But nowadays, it's difficult to be
popular just because you're cute.

286
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,510
- What a pity.
- What a shame.

287
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,246
You were born in the wrong time,
Mihane.

288
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,414
It was wrong?

289
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,618
- I'm home.
- Welcome back...

290
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,689
Don't eat my brain!

291
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,424
What?

292
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,126
What's wrong with Keita?

293
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,461
No idea.

294
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,865
Rock, paper, scissors!

295
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,567
Yes!

296
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,503
Pineapple...

297
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,408
I think it might be the last time
we go to the festival together.

298
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,943
Why?

299
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,979
We might not be in this town
next year.

300
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:41,881
I see...

301
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:49,522
Ojo said that she wanted you to hold
her in your arms in your yukata.

302
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,424
Why don't you go with her?

303
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,930
Rock, paper, scissors...

304
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,131
Yes!

305
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,734
Chocolate...

306
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,238
Yeah, perhaps.

307
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,374
Mihane makes me eat the octopus
in the Takoyaki,

308
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,410
it's awful every year.

309
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,112
I'm not having any Takoyaki
this year.

310
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,749
Rock, paper, scissors...

311
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,819
Pineapple!

312
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,656
Apple...

313
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,961
Gosh, he's annoying!

314
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,967
You didn't win even once. It doesn't
make sense in theory.

315
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,469
I was serious when
I played the game.

316
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,771
Mihane, thanks for the juice.

317
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,440
Thanks for the juice!

318
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,376
Darn...

319
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,816
Ryu, sorry to have kept you waiting.

320
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,994
My gasoline has a girlfriend?

321
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,363
And she has long hair.

322
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,367
I'm so angry!

323
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,903
I'm really angry!

324
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,208
Anyway, my back feels itchy.
Scratch it for me.

325
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,446
Mihane doesn't act like a lady.

326
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,615
Because it's Goro.

327
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,317
Come on, be a lady!

328
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,320
Everyone will criticize you
for saying that.

329
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,026
Okay!

330
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,595
Bye bye bi...

331
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,337
Everything is the same as usual.

332
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,541
What should I take in my photo?

333
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,914
Would you like an ice-cream?

334
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,784
Ice-cream...

335
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,219
That's not it...

336
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,660
That's it...Over here.

337
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,040
A turtle?

338
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,410
Why is this turtle here?

339
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,257
Watch out!

340
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,028
Somehow my luck is bad today.

341
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:18,965
I'm going to die!

342
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,672
What?

343
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:40,319
Why?

344
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,124
I'm dead, right? Am I...

345
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:46,859
A ghost?

346
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,195
Oh, old lady!

347
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,330
Can you see me?

348
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:56,469
Someone from the other world has
finally come for me, too?

349
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,339
I'm a god of death?

350
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,674
What's going on?

351
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,209
- Mihane.
- What?

352
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:05,745
Shohei!

353
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:08,614
Stop...It's okay...Calm down.

354
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,416
- Calm down and tell me.
- Am I dead?

355
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,619
- I'm a god of death? A ghost?
- No, you're not dead...

356
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,626
The same period of time
repeated itself.

357
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:25,998
It's your imagination.

358
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:30,336
But the turtle! Is it possible that
I was holding it before I knew it?

359
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,004
Oh, that.

360
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:33,706
That?

361
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,575
I'm saying,

362
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,878
that you've got...

363
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,481
your camera and the turtle mixed up.

364
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:43,783
I see.

365
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,486
They're similar.

366
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,523
They're totally different!

367
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,492
I've read it in comic books,

368
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,995
I think it's like "time-leap".

369
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,463
Impossible.

370
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,700
It's impossible.
You're not Urashima Taro...

371
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,468
That's it!

372
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,137
This turtle has such power!

373
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:06,906
What?

374
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,278
Mihane...

375
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:14,647
Mihane?

376
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:15,882
Again.

377
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:19,886
Mihane...

378
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,155
Miss Mihane?

379
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,925
You don't want people to think
that you're creepy, right?

380
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,930
So, the story about you
leapt through time...

381
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,633
You'd better not tell anyone.

382
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,004
Got it?

383
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,840
Have you got it?

384
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,441
No, I don't.

385
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,877
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

386
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,613
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

387
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,884
What are you doing?

388
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,487
It's a secret.

389
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,989
If I tell you I can leap
through time,

390
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,691
you'll make a fool of me and
won't believe me.

391
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,793
I'll definitely keep it a secret.

392
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,632
Mom! Mihane became an imbecile!

393
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:20,346
Why did I have my hair
cut like this?

394
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,123
Okay, I'll make you look cute.

395
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,025
No...No!

396
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,528
"6th July"

397
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,964

398
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:38,831
What?

399
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:40,967
What just happened?

400
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,235
What happened, Mihane...

401
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,971
A cockroach!

402
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,173
- I'm too confused for that!
- Dad, there's a cockroach!

403
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,874
Come and get rid of it now!

404
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,009
It's not the turtle.

405
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,043
Dad!

406
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,346
I...

407
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,650
I...leapt through time?

408
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,701
"6th July"

409
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,706
Okay, I'll make you look cute.

410
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:21,874
Stop!

411
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,547
Yes! I don't have to get my hair
cut into a weird style!

412
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:33,719
I can do it!

413
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,689
I can leap through time!

414
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:40,359
Watch out!

415
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,001
Today is 7th July,
the Star Festival.

416
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,238
Perhaps you would like to write your
wish on strips of paper.

417
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,340
Look! I look good, right?

418
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,208
I look good, right?

419
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,278
I gave you money to get it cut in a
hair salon but it wasn't cut.

420
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,613
That's why I look good!

421
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,748
Bon appetit!

422
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,817
It was found by Miss Onishi here.

423
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,820
Would you tell us how you found it?

424
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:12,091
Something horrible might happen,
and this could be a sign.

425
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,195
You have a girlfriend!

426
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,898
And you don't care about
my hairstyle!

427
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,236
I've got a stomachache.

428
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,772
3 minus 1 is 2,

429
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,607
so you times it by 1 over 2.

430
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:33,245
This is the trick of doing
a partial fraction decomposition.

431
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:34,580
Got it?

432
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,551
Now, let's do a similar question
after this.

433
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,886
- Let's see who wants to do it.
- Me!

434
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,695
I think it's going to snow, right?

435
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,899
I've done some reading.

436
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,534
Well done.

437
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,981
Amazing! You caught it!

438
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,153
Oh, my god!

439
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,755
What the heck?

440
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,296
Oh, darn...

441
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,166
She is soaked...

442
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,200
Water!

443
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:29,568
Water!

444
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,104
Hang on...No...Don't use this.

445
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,406
- Why?
- It's broken.

446
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,343
Use this.

447
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,345
Rock, paper, scissors...

448
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,380
- What the heck?
- Why?

449
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,916
Chocolate...

450
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,417
I reached the goal!

451
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,920
Hey, hang on!

452
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,290
It doesn't make sense in theory
that you didn't lose even once.

453
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,460
Because I was serious
when I played the game.

454
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,429
The one who loses
will treat us to fruit juice!

455
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,866
- Keep your promise.
- I'll definitely win this.

456
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:02,835
Rock, paper, scissors...

457
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,470
Once more!

461
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,113
The sound...

462
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,248
The rhythm...

463
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,251
It makes me feel so safe
that I got sleepy.

464
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,086
You used to sleep when
you were small.

465
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,122
I miss the days when Goro had to

466
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,957
support your head
when I cut your hair.

467
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,993
I guess Mihane is the beauty of our
shop when she comes here.

468
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,863
Most ladies don't come anymore.

469
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,499
- Most young men don't, too.
- I see.

470
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,236
- So, do you like it?
- What...

471
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,038
Well...

472
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,941
I can do stylish and trendy
hairstyles, too.

473
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,177
But the way you say it
sounds old-fashioned.

474
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:49,715
Your dad used to be handsome.

475
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,384
You used to be gorgeous, too.

476
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,355
Time is a cruel thing.

477
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,991
You're one of our family, too.

478
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,704
Oh? There's a power cut?

479
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,707
Hey, Mihane, bring me a torch.

480
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,982
Thanks...What are you doing?

481
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,318
What's that?

482
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,053
I hear something.

483
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,288
What is it?

484
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,257
Be careful.

485
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,760
- Mom, there's a fire!
- A fire?

486
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,128
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

487
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,163
- Over there.
- The light can't reach there.

488
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,299
- There's smoke coming out.
- Yes, there is.

489
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,734
It's where Goro's home is.

490
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,836
Goro...You mean the Asakura family?

491

Goro, glad to see that you're okay.

There is a small fire
at the substation.

Are you okay?

00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,195
The fire has been put out.

- even if your looks...
- ...are cute,

Yes, I know.

I'll be an idol who makes
prophecies.

Sure.

But it's true!

quickly, so please don't worry.

- I haven't got any.

544
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,971
But I saw you wearing them!

- What? You saw that?
- Hey.

546

You're going to get laughed at if
you upload it to the internet.

Well, I doubt it.

What?

- Polka dots...
- Here he is.

- That's a pair polka dots pajamas!
- No, this...

a fire soon.

when it was going to happen?

I can't tell you.

It's about time for you
to tell us the truth.

654
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,255
I can leap through time.

655
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:33,992
Hey,

656
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,095
- just tell us...
- I can leap through time.

657
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,735
It's the fireworks?

658
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,371
The town is holding
the Star Festival event now.

659
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,877
I guess I'm really...

660
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:56,982
...not cut out to be an idol.

661
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,591
We'll start filming now.

662
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:07,759
"6th July"

663
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,796
Five seconds to go.
Four, three, two...

664
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,902
It didn't occur to me that
I would find a giant oarfish.

665
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,172
Something horrible might happen,
and this could be a sign.

666
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:24,075
Wow, she's on the news program that
is broadcasted to the whole nation.

667
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:26,611
I'm happy to be
a normal high school student.

668
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,919
I can't use something that is going
to cause a big fuss.

669
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,288
- I've finished breakfast.
- Okay.

670
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,857
Mihane, the ice-cream in
the freezer is mine...

671
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,358
What? You're eating it?

672
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,261
Don't worry, I'll put it back later.

673
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,563
Gosh, you're horrible!

674
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,033
Mom, get this jerk to swallow
a thousand needles!

675
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,035
Naho, don't use the word, "jerk".

676
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:52,704
See you.

677
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,508
Come on, Mihane, go get dressed.

678
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,110
- I'll sleep for a bit more.
- What?

679
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,880
But you've never taken a day off
since kindergarten.

680
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,951
Don't worry, I'm still not going
to take a day off.

681
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:09,287
What?

682
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,257
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

683
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,596
"9th July"

684
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:29,174
Sorry.

685
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,045
I think Shohei is busy,
so he can't come.

686
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,113
What?

687
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,148
What a shame!

688
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,584
It could be the last time
we come together.

689
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,553
Let's enjoy it for him, then.

690
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,426
Anyway, I'm wearing my yukata,

691
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,095
and you haven't said anything.

692
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,465
You're really...

693
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:54,966
...cute.

694
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,036
You sound like I made you say it.

695
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:11,149
You really have to look at
the fireworks at a close distance.

696
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:12,784
Octopus.

697
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:16,821
One more.

698
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,326
When are you going to be able
to eat your octopus?

699
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,163
The shell is the delicious part.

700
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:35,106
I'm happy that I can go to festivals
as an ordinary high school student.

701
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,009
That's what girls who
became idols say.

702
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,045
But I did.

703
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,281
I was a world famous idol.

704
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,083
Wow. In your dreams.

705
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:46,951
Be grateful!

706
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:50,321
You could come to a boring festival
in the countryside with me.

707
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,823
Well, thank you.

708
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:53,191
Sure.

709
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:55,493
By the way,

710
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,364
will you be my wife?

711
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:02,400
- Idiot.
- No.

712
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,003
Seriously,

713
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:09,207
can you be my girlfriend?

714
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:12,577
What?

715
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:14,979
You can't?

716
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,986
Goro, you look so funny
when you get serious.

717
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,588
I am serious.

718
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,692
Please be my girlfriend.

719
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:35,733
It's hot!

720
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:38,970
Sorry.

721
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,075
I think Shohei is busy,
so he can't come.

722
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,743
Oh, is he?

723
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,314
You yukata is cute.

724
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,651
I mean, you look cute
in your yukata.

725
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,053
Thanks.

726
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,022
What's the matter?

727
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,091
You're acting weird.

728
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:02,994
No...No, I'm not.

729
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,798
We used to hold hands like this,

730
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:08,967
so that we wouldn't get separated.

731
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:14,873
Takoyaki!

732
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,615
You can eat your octopus now?

733
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:26,651
I would've eaten it for you.

734
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,754
Well, I'm 18 years old now.

735
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,965
- Goro, octopus...
- Will you try dating?

736
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,202
I mean the two of us.

737
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,375
We were talking about octopus,
why ask that out of the blue?

738
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:52,377
Tonight, I have been...

739
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,113
...waiting for the right time
to ask you.

740
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:00,919
Mihane, I...

741
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:02,820
I love you.

742
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:11,029
I love you!

743
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,334
I said, I love you!

744
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,607
Sorry.

745
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:28,112
- I think Shohei is busy and he...
- I don't want a boyfriend now!

746
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:31,216
Why say that out of the blue?

747
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,251
Okay.

748
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,986
Let's go to see the fireworks.

749
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,656
I...

750
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,492
I want you to be my girlfriend.

751
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:44,495
I love you.

752
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:51,569
Ouch!

753
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:55,240
Why didn't you come to the festival?

754
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,274
"8th July"

755
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,508
I didn't come?

756
00:47:58,176 --> 00:47:59,777
But the festival is tomorrow.

757
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,146
Yeah, it is...

758
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:03,881
It's tomorrow.

759
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:05,783
Tomorrow!

760
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:08,553
You won't come to the festival
because you're busy!

761
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,989
If you don't, Goro...

762
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,159
Anyway, I'll be in trouble!

763
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:16,794
Okay...

764
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:19,998
Come to the festival with us!

765
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:21,666
Please.

766
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,904
But Goro told me that we're not
going to the festival...

767
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,211
That's what happened...

768
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:37,882
I mean...

769
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,319
Goro...

770
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:46,491
...is in love with me.

771
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:49,193
In love?

772
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:53,665
We've always been close,

773
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,735
and I treasure the friendship
between us now.

774
00:48:58,936 --> 00:48:59,637
Love...

775
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,007
What does it feel like?

776
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,243
I mean "being in love".

777
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:09,447
I heard that such thing existed
in the past,

778
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,816
I mean, I've heard of it...
Oh, I'm sorry...

779
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,752
Not in the past, I mean, nowadays.

780
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,321
So...

781
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,089
What does it feel like?

782
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,325
Being in love.

783
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:29,233
I've been seeking advice from
the wrong person...

784
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,038
Anyway!

785
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:37,108
Make sure that you come
to the festival!

786
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,109
Remember!

787
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,148
In love...

788
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:47,085
In love...

789
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,131
Wow, it's so good!

790
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:04,869
By the way, mom,

791
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,004
have you ever been in love?

792
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,874
- Why ask me out of the blue?
- Well...

793
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:13,010
I'm just wondering whether
I'm able to fall in love or not.

794
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:18,616
I mean, you can't take for granted
that you can fall in love.

795
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:20,284
Like 500 years ago from now,

796
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,755
in the Sengoku period, when people
marry for political reasons,

797
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,990
in the future 100 years later,

798
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,593
love between men and women
does not exist.

799
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,730
You're allotted a partner based on
how good your DNA match.

800
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:36,701
Everybody can fall in love.

801
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:38,202
- Is that so?
- Yes.

802
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,905
Just find your love
in your own time.

803
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,340
I see...

804
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,115
"The Ultimate Manual of Love
for Beginners"

805
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,125
Every single one of them
are horrible!

806
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,693
The match-making party
didn't go well again?

807
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:05,663
Well, I was popular,

808
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,832
but all the guys were too shy.

809
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,701
If they had approached me
more passionately,

810
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,538
I would have fallen in love
with them right away.

811
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:17,675
- Welcome!
- Hello.

812
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,448
Miss Maekawa?

813
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:25,883
Mr. Yano?

814
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:29,487
- You come to dine here, too?
- Yeah, from time to time.

815
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:35,326
Why do you sit so far away from
each other? You don't get along?

816
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,861
I...

817
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,698
Would you mind if I sit next to you?

818
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,701
No...Be my guest.

819
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,839
- What would you like to drink?
- Beer, please.

820
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,540
- Sure.
- A glass of beer!

821
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:53,010
- Please...please try some.
- Oh, thank you.

822
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:01,085
Help her out in a difficult
situation and she'll fall in love.

823
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,156
Help her out in a
difficult situation...

824
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:07,358
Fall in love?

825
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,027
"9th July"

826
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:18,202
Okay...

827
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:20,204
Sorry.

828
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,774
I think Shohei is busy
and he can't come.

829
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:25,576
- He said he's free now.
- What?

830
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:28,946
Wow, this shaved ice is so good!
Oh, my god!

831
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:30,948
It could be the last time,

832
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,750
I'm glad that
we can all go together.

833
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:33,918
It's so good.

834
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:35,786
It's really good.

835
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,494
Just because I can now
leap through time,

836
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,797
I just can't get myself to
just try and date him.

837
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:50,001
My first boyfriend...

838
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,137
My first love...

839
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,943
I want it to be something
that definitely can't be repeated.

840
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,750
- You're blocking me...
- Okay, I'll take the photo.

841
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,385
- Ready?
- Yes!

842
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:08,286
Okay.

843
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:11,756
Okay...

844
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:13,991
- Have you got it?
- Have you taken it?

845
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:15,192
- Have you?
- Yes, I'm sure.

846
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:16,193
Really?

847
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,364
She is so late...

848
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,700
That's why I said I'd go to buy it.

849
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,469
The frozen pineapple is so good!

850
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:26,637
Really?

851
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,507
It's so scary...
It's so good that it's scary!

852
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,379
The frozen pineapple is so good!

853
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,547
Thank you.

854
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,282
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

855

00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,021

Are you okay?

Shohei!

Shohei!

Hey!

00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,502
No!

Shohei!

It's so scary...
It's so good that it's scary!

870
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:00,998
Watch out!

871
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,507
Shohei!

Watch out!

874
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:24,789
What are you doing?

875
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:28,592
My pineapple...

876
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,962
What a relief!

877
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,299
I'm glad that you're okay...

878
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:38,202
I'm not okay at all! My pineapple!

00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:41,405
What's wrong?

880
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:43,674
The lanterns collapsed

881
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,343
and then fell on top of Shohei.

882
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:49,146
It was really horrible.

883
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,115
It's true...

884
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,050
That was a close call...

885
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,985
We'll change the rope.
Get me a new one.

886
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:55,920
Okay.

887
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,291
I thought you were dead.

888
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:03,194
I thought I couldn't save you.

889
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:05,996
So I'm relieved now...

890
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,866
I'm so glad to see you alive.

891
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,869
Why are you crying?

892
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,071
I was worried!

893
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:15,773
You idiot...

894
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:19,910
- Don't laugh!
- You're crying too much.

895
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:21,746
Don't laugh!

896
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:25,449
- It's because you're crying.
- No, I'm not.

Anyway, why is it called
a Frankfurter?

901
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:34,625
Look it up on the internet.

902
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,827
What has it got to
do with the place?

903

I don't know.

I'll see you home.

906
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,803
I'm going to shout at Shohei,

907
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,006
- so I'll go with Shohei.
- What? Hang on.

908
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,341
You're still angry?

909
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,409
- I have no idea.
- See you tomorrow.

910

Goro.

00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,920
See me home, please! Goro!

914
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:18,235
So...

915
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,739
Why do you have to shout at me?

916
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,574
I lied.

917
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:30,481
I can't be with Goro alone tonight.

918
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,585
Because he'll confess his love?

919
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,589
I'm horrible, am I not?

920
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:42,493
I'm not sure,

921
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,629
but she must have turn back time

922
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:47,965
and saved my life.

923
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,035
She looked weird when she cried,

924
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:52,570
but...

925
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:54,538
I was happy.

00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,147

00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:21,365
Go away!

930
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:23,000
...and I was really frightened.

931
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:24,902
Are you okay, Mihane?

932
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,739
Mihane, it's okay now.

Goro saved my life
with all his might.

No.

936
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:49,193
I did.

937
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:52,463
Shohei...

938
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,366
...saved you with all his might.

Shohei saved my life
with all his might.

941

It brings back memories.

942
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:05,876
Yeah.

943
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,580
- Hey!
- Cut it out!

944
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,948
How do you explain this text?

945
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,983
Don't check my mobile
without asking.

946
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,219
You're horrible!

947
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:16,987
Ouch!

948
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:22,526
Two more people fell out of love
in this world.

it will end like that someday.

952
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,949
I want to be great friends with him
forever.

953
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:50,587
When was the last time
we talked so much like this?

954
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,589
I can't remember.

955
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,093
But I'm glad that
we've talked so much.

956
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:03,867
See you.

Mihane, five more minutes.

961
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,498
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes?

962
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,376
Good morning...

963
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,380
Good morning...

964
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:28,585
In the time when I cannot go back,

965
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:29,586
Oh?

966
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,587
There is...

967
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,455
Oh?

968
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:32,689
...summer, and love.

969
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:36,927
It's all your fault.

970
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,930
Please make the potion now.

971
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,299
I want to go to meet the person
with my power.

972
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,568
I wonder if the girl was in love.

973
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,671
I think I can convey her love
with my photos.

974
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:49,440
Do you want to try to kiss?
