1
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,773
First, I want to point out

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,442
that it's all your fault.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,985
Wow!

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,754
We're here!

5
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,355
We are here!

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,957
And it's hot!

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,360
It's hotter and more humid
than I thought!

8
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:27,995
Help!

9
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,965
First of all, don't tell anybody
about us.

10
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:39,006
If you break our promise, we'll melt
your brain and eat it!

11
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,209
It's safer to hypnotize him.

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,345
But it's difficult to hypnotize
a child.

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,048
And we'll be here for just three
hours, so it's not a problem.

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,761
What a gorgeous season!

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,565
Summer...

16
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,071
Because of what happened that day,

17
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,673
we don't have seasons
in the 22th Century,

18
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:16,210
and our world is covered with snow
throughout the year...

19
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,380
I guess people of this era
won't believe this.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,916
I hope there is summer
in the time we live in.

21
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,617
Let's bring it back.

22
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,987
"Barber Asakura"

23
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,255
Hey.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,826
You won't be popular with girls
wearing that hairstyle.

25
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,528
- What?
- Darling!

26
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,997
Do something about his hairstyle!

27
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,799
You won't be popular with girls
wearing that hairstyle!

28
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,000
I am, so don't bother.

29
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,402
Hang on, seriously...

30
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,538
I simply don't want this. No, stop!

31
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,742
You're going back
wearing that hairstyle?

32
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,712
It's awful. This is really horrible.

33
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:56,317
In my opinion, girls who wear a
mushroom haircut are masochists.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,255
The professor is going to praise us
on our research sample, too...

35
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,258
What's the matter?

36
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,595
I lost the potion...

37
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,863
What?

38
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,499
You lost the potion?

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,635
- You mean we can't go back?
- It's not totally impossible now,

40
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,170
If we add the spare drug,
Crocus Silvius,

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,239
to a herb made with dried lavender,

42
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,774

00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,052
All right...

45
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,231
What are you doing in my home?

46
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,546
Have we got any
experimental apparatus at home,

47
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,914
Mom?

48
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,750
We haven't got any
experimental apparatus at home.

49
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,586
Shohei!

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,990
I think the school will lend it to
you if you ask your teacher.

51
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,292
I see.

52
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,160
The school...

53
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:15,863
It's so good!

54
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,501
Oh, slow down...

55
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,400
What the heck?

56
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,368
Good morning.

57
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,510
Who is it?

58
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,913
Is someone in there?

59
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:30,237
It is all your fault.

60
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,007
You mean...

61
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,743
We cannot go back to Year 2122?

62
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,582
- Well...
- You said we could go back!

63
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,918
- We will...
- You said we could!

64
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,453
Rock, scissors, paper...

65
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,589
I repeat...

66
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,625
This is all your fault.

67
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,162
The story about you have leapt
through time...

68
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,532
You'd better not tell anyone.

69
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,670
I just came to this era...

70
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,906
Shohei, watch out!

71
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,676
...to do some research on summer.

72
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:16,050
It was me. Shohei saved your life
with all his might.

73
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,952
But before I knew it...

74
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,121
Your yukata looks nice.

75
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,692
Good night.

76
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,827
Good night...

77
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,129
I've fallen in love...

78
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,968
...in this era.

Episode 2"

80
00:06:55,716 --> 00:07:00,621
I still remember what your dream was
when you were in kindergarten, Goro.

81
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,524
You dreamt of becoming
a pair of scissors.

82
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,593
I thought you were
a dangerous boy.

83
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,133
What?

84
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,774
Goro, you still haven't given up?

85
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,944
I told you,

86
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,147
I want to remain friends with you!

00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,420
Mihane.

89
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,622
Have you ever kissed anyone?

90
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,658
Why ask that out of the blue?

91
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,260
I heard that it tastes like lemon,

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,962
lemon flavored shaved ice.

93
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,064
It tastes good, right?

94
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,337
Wait, where is Goro?

95
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,240
Do you want to try kissing me?

96
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,878
What are you talking about?
I'm not kissing a friend!

97
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,646
But you kissed Goro.

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,114
No, I didn't!

99
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:08,622
Shohei, do you have a crush on me,
too, by any chance?

100
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,660
No, please don't do that!

101
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,529
Please don't do that!

102
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,999
Don't do what?

103
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,670
You're the one who did something I
don't want you to, Mihane Yoshiyama.

104
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,941
You'll be tested on the quadratic
equation written on the blackboard.

105
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:32,212
Mr. Yano, will we be tested on the
solution of cubic equations?

No, you won't be tested on that yet.

107

You will be tested on topics till
quadratic equations this time.

108
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:39,887
What troubled you in your dream?

109
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,356
What? I won't tell you two.

110
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,157
It's so erotic
that you can't tell us?

111
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,193

- Idiot!

00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,828
- It wasn't!
- She got defensive.

No, I didn't! Why have you got
a watermelon?

114
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,166
This is my lunch!

The slowest one has to
do a quick trick.

No! Wait for me!

00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,007
- I got here.
- Darn, I lost...

118
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,775
- Hang on...
- Ow...

119
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,778
- Look...
- Oh!

120
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,813
It's Nishioka?

121
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,355
- This is dangerous...
- Isn't it dangerous?

122
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,524
This is bad...

123
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,676
Don't kill yourself!

124
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,418
You almost killed me!

125
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,457
I just love heights a lot.

126
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,962
It makes my heart race,

127
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,998
and it makes me feel alive.

128
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,869
This is bad...

129
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,542
Actually, today is the anniversary
of my death.

130
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,784
- Your chest looks good.
- Indeed.

131
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,052
No...

132
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,254
That's not the point.

133
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,526
I had my heart transplanted
on this day, two years ago.

134
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:32,332
So, to the old me, today is
the anniversary of my death,

135
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,169
and it's the two-year-old birthday
of the new me.

136
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,741
The new me is me, too,
but it isn't me at the same time.

137
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:43,910
What do you mean?

138
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,747
My personality changed.

139
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,983
I used to be afraid of heights,

140
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,886
but now I love it for no reason.

141
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,959
Also, my heart always beats quickly
after 8 o'clock every night.

142
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,995
I have no idea why, though.

143
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:06,033
You mean the original owner of your
heart has something to do with this?

144
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:11,071
I don't know, because nobody told me
anything about the donor.

145
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,077
But I was told that the donor was
15 to 18 years old.

146
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,614
Anyway, I am grateful to
that person.

147
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,215
So...

148
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,821
At least,

149
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,458
I want to live my life in a way that
will make the heart happy.

150
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,004
This is unbelievable.

151
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,507
What does it take to make you
believe that?

152
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,176
I do think there are aliens, though.

153
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,711
What, aliens?

154
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,483
That person tumbled...

155
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,333
Guys, I think I will tell you
my secret.

156
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,471
- Your secret?
- I don't want to know.

157
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,506
I can leap through time!

158
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:21,575
What?

159
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,276
She said it.

160
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,546
I have no idea why
I have this power,

161
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,483
but I think I had it since I passed
out in the lab's storage room.

162
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,384
Now I can turn back time.

163
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,452
Should I laugh?

164
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,355
- Should I laugh?
- Let's play rock, scissors, paper.

165
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,991
- I am surely not going to lose.
- You're sure?

166
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,993
- I'm sure!
- You're exaggerating it.

167
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,294
I will surely win!

168
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,295
Fine.

169
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,831
Rock, scissors, paper...

170
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:48,835
Hang on.

171
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,506
Rock, scissors, paper!

172
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,409
Wait...

173
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,846
How can I possibly believe this...

174
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,881
Right?

175
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,416
Shohei, do you believe that?

176
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:07,053
Well, I seriously don't want to
believe this.

177
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,989
She'll tumble three seconds later.

178
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,359
- What?
- Three, two, one.

179
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,902
See? See?

180
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:27,841
So, I want to go to meet the person
using my power.

181
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,010
You mean the original owner
of Nishioka's heart?

182
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:30,844
Yes.

183
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,880
The person absolutely loved heights!

184
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,482
Aren't you curious about
what the person was like?

185
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,283
Not really.

186
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,718
I'm curious about the mystery of why
the heart beats quicker after 8 p.m.

187
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,287
No, you shouldn't.

188
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,324
If there is the slightest chance
that the person's life was saved,

189
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,827
then Nishioka wouldn't have gotten
his heart transplanted.

190
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,564
You should not do it, definitely.

191
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,732
It'll cause many problems.

192
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,570
I'm not trying to change the past.

193
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,206
I just want to know.

194
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,576
- Don't be too nosy.
- Exactly.

195
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,578
You two take it too seriously.

196
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,749
If you do possess such power,
you can use it on other things.

197
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,718
You're absolutely correct.

198
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,088
Will you be my girlfriend?

199
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,590
I...

200
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,259
I hope you'll be my girlfriend.

201
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,827
Mihane...

202
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,662
I love you.

203
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,999
I have used it.

204
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,702
To make what bothered me
didn't happen.

205
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:29,869
What bothered you?

206
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,607
- Don't be too nosy.
- You're annoying.

207
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,776
I am going to meet the person.

208
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,912
I'm curious about
what the person is like.

209
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,381
Take it.

210
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,949
You'll leap through time, right?

211
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,753
Try and do it. We'll be looking.

212
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,792
But I'll get nervous if you
stare at me.

213
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,630
- Don't look!
- Idiot!

214
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,500
What?

215
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,170
She's gone. What?

216
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,540
What?

217
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,377
What? Seriously, Mihane!

218
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,980
This is impossible...Shohei...

219
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,782
This is real, right? Yeah?

220
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,152
Mihane!

221
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,188
I hope this won't cause
any trouble...

222
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,492
- What just happened?
- Ouch!

223
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,360
This is impossible!

224
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,462
She is back.

225
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,698
Back? What is back?

226
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,403
Wow! Why, Mihane? Why?
You're okay, right?

227
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,839
Are you injured? Is there anything
wrong with your body?

228
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,676
- Wow, this is awesome!
- So,

229
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,411
- how did it go?
- Wow!

230
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,545
Wow!

231
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,748
She wasn't someone
who loved heights.

232
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,116
- What?
- Wow!

233
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,752
This is awesome!

234
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,255
"Barber Asakura"

235
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,257
A bicycle accident happened

236
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,794
on the day before this two
years ago in Shizuoka.

237
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,403
The slope was steep,
and the brake was broken.

238
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,707
She couldn't stop her bicycle.

239
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,511
The victim died in the accident

240
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,949
was a girl in her third year
in high school.

241
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,653
Wow, she is gorgeous!

242
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,496
She always went to the library

243
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,165
and revised for her exam until the
library was going to close.

244
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,533
She was a hard-working girl.

245
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,506
Oh, no!

246
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,185
Then...Why does Nishioka love
heights now?

247
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,191
More importantly, was that
the right person?

248
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,694
Well, she was the right person.

249
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,497
What about the mysterious beating of
the heart after 8 p.m?

250
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:11,865
No idea.

251
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,634
But...

252
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,905
She always went to the train station
when she went home from the library.

253
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:19,906
Station...

254
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,009
She wasn't meeting up with anyone,

255
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,147
she'd just saw the 20:20 train off,
then she would go home.

256
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,916
I see.

257
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,217
What?

258
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,453
What? Have you solved it?

259
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,455
- Yes, it's obvious.
- Of course.

260
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,657
- Say it.
- She's a railway nerd!

261
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:38,858
What?

262
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,960
- What?
- What?

263
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,329
He was on the train.

264
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,165
- Who? Me?
- No.

265
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,533
The guy she loved.

266
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,036
- Oh.
- What?

267
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,273
Oh...

268
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,075
I'll go and check.

269
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,611
- What?
- Hey, Mihane!

270
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,251
She said it like she was just going
to a convenient store.

271
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,488
- Is it okay to leap through time?
- No, it's not...

272
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,457
I don't think so...

273
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,428
- Watch it...
- Wow!

274
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,998
Are you okay? Anyway,
have you found that out?

275
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,336
The girl...She was in love,
wasn't she?

276
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,707
Rather than being in love, she...

277
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,414
She was trying desperately
to hold back her love.

278
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,316
Try to hold back her love?

279
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,200
We should avoid contact with the
locals by all means.

280
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,069
That's what the professor told us.

281
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,006
Though we have hypnotized them, I
still don't think it's a good idea.

282
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:06,112
What are you trying to do by
slipping into the school?

283
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,448
People living in this age...

284
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,917
They fall in love.

285
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,552
Love?

286
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,256
Oh! In the first half of the
21st Century,

287
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,125
people could still fall in love
freely, couldn't they?

288
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,960
They would go on dates,

289
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,197
or look at the train that the person
they loved took until it was gone.

290
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,367
They would kiss their loved ones.

291
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,236
Kiss?

292
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,508
Like they put their mouths together?

293
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:40,547
Sometimes it's more than just
putting their mouths together.

294
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,449
Is that so? You know a lot.

295
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,318
I've done my research.

296
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:48,755
What?

297
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,992
Do you...want to fall in love?

298
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,928
No, it's absurd...

299
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:03,303
Love between men and women is
inefficient and bears great risks.

300
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,708
98 percent of the people in
the 22nd Century

301
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,178
agree on marriage based on the
compatibility of DNA.

302
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,314
Of course, I'm one of them, too.

303
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:19,452
Until we've made the potion,
we can't return to the 22nd Century.

304
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,122
Now that we're living in Year 2016,

305
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,793
why don't you enjoy it, too, Zoe?

"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

308
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,739
You uploaded this to the internet?

309
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,840
Yeah, everyone is doing it.

310
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:41,774
Good morning.

311
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,811
Hey, Shohei, look at this!

312
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,814
Spiderman Kiss!

313
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,148
Yes!

314
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,118
You're going to regret it.

315
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,686
It'll be there forever!

316
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,422
That's why! He is really romantic,

317
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,258
and he said that our love would stay
forever if we did that.

318
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,161
It's like something that Nagashima
would say.

319
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,430
- It's fantastic!
- I know!

320
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,431
Hang on.

321
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,034
Who is Nagashima?

322
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,902
All the photos are great.

323
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,604
Yeah, they are!

324
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,940
- What? These are good?
- Show me more...

325
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,009
These?

326
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,070
It's not because she loved heights.

327
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:49,842
Sorry.

328
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,845
I checked it without telling you.

329
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,847
You mean the donor?

330
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,988
Please, tell me what she was like.

331
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,691
The person...

332
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,694
She was a hard-working girl...

333
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,568
"I hope the love between my teacher
and I is mutual,"

334
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,703
"but I'll hold back
until I graduate."

335
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:20,573
She fell in love with someone
who she shouldn't have.

336
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,462
Well, you might not believe it,

337
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:43,796
but that's why.

338
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,965
I see...

339
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,802
She did that after 8 o'clock
in the evening...

340
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,840
Thank you for doing this.

341
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,409
No, it's not a big deal...

342
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,479
I actually did something
uncalled for...

343
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,480
No, you didn't.

344
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,484
The reason that the heart beats
quickly every day after 8 o'clock

345
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,886
is because she wanted to stop
holding back

346
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,021
the love she had been
stopping herself to feel.

347
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,391
I see...

348
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:16,729
You have to do what you want to do
while you still can.

349
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,871
But I don't think she'd appreciate
being dragged to high places.

350
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:28,574
She'd say that it wasn't why she
wanted her heart to beat so fast.

351
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,113
I didn't tell Nishioka...

352
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,649
everything about the girl.

353
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,160
What?

354
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,797
She had a crush on Mr. Yano?

355
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,100
Nobody knows about it.

356
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,570
It happened before Mr. Yano came to
teach at our school.

357
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:03,810
I'm the type that always poke my
nose into what doesn't concern me.

358
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,979
Don't forget your cubic functions,
too.

359
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,850
Guys, you're fed up with this
already?

360
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,021
If you want to enter
a national public university,

361
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:19,058
you should work harder on
the main subjects.

362
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,662
Mr. Yano...

363
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,399
Have you ever fallen in love
with a student?

364
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,201
Why ask that out of the blue?

365
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,404
Of course not! It'd cause a problem
if I had.

366
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,405
But...

367
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,108
A student had fallen in love
with you, right?

368
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,311
Why?

369
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,216
How did you feel towards that girl?

370
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,422
Nobody has fallen in love with me.

371
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:52,892
In the last school you taught in.

372
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,796
There really was nobody?

373
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,739
If you count someone who
misunderstood their feelings,

374
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:08,507
then, yes.

375
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,409
Perhaps...

376
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,147
She didn't misunderstand it.

377
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,353
I didn't know for sure in the end,
and I will never know.

378
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,722
Don't say anything you shouldn't.

379
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,399
It's a tragedy that one dies before

380
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,268
they can convey their love to
the person they love.

381
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,970
It's a super tragedy.

382
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,907
It's because no one would think
about when they'll die.

383
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,976
And the person she loved thinks
she didn't understand how she felt.

384
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,612
It makes me frustrated!

385
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,447
Why are you frustrated?

386
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,951
She had endured what made her suffer
and had worked really hard,

387
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:56,188
but suddenly everything ended.
Do you know how frustrating it is?

388
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,659
I understand how it feels.

389
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,395
Are you talking...

390
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:06,432
about having to quit the boat club
because you hurt your back?

391
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,103
All the efforts and dreams vanished.

392
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,773
Without a trace.

393
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,847
He denied her love for him.

394
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,518
But she did love him.

395
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,187
Mihane...

396
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,490
Just because you can leap
through time,

397
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,593
doesn't mean that you can
change the girl's fate.

398
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:40,132
If you do, you're going to take
Nishioka's life away from him.

399
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,472
Yeah, I know that.

400
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,385
- Anyway, Goro...
- Yes?

401
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:05,257
You're in love with Mihane,
aren't you?

402
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,095
What?

403
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,599
Actually, I think I might be in love
with Mihane, too...

404
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:18,971
Is it okay for two people to fall in
love with the same person?

405
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,741
What kind of question is that?

406
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,844
I have never fallen in love before,
so I know nothing about it.

407
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,514
I hope it's okay...

408
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,718
Well, I think...

409
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:37,089
we'll leave this to Mihane
to decide?

410
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,393
Yeah, we should...

411
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,095
See you.

412
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,737
Goro...

413
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,473
Have you ever kissed anyone?

414
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,443
What?

415
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,847
I wonder whether Mihane has kissed
anyone or not before.

416
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,151
I have no idea.

417
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,286
That means,

418
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:10,489
you and Mihane have not kissed yet.

419
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,763
Good...

420
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,764
Good?

421
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,800
Yes! Yes!

422
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,936
What is so good?

423
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,409
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

424
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:31,444
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

425
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,045
Bye bye bi...

426
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,114
Bye bye bi.

427
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:44,156
I didn't tell anyone!
Don't eat my brain!

428
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,092
I won't eat your brain.

429
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,726
But, please...

430
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,064
Give me something...

431
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,066
...to eat.

432
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,505
- I'm home!
- Welcome home...

433
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,407
- Hey, Mi-kun,
- Yes?

434
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,310
my friend is hungry,

435
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,379
so I want to give her
a pork and egg Okonomiyaki.

436
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,349
To your friend?

437
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,384
Yeah, sure...

438
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,421
Why don't you bring
your friend here?

439
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,491
Haven't you got a home?

440
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,092
Where is your family?

441
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:24,196
They're somewhere very far away.
I can't go home now.

442
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,932
But you have a friend, right?

443
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,467
Oh...My senior?

444
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,636
He made me really angry.

445
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,806
- You had a fight?
- Something like that.

446
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,078
What is it called? Pork and egg?

447
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,680
This tastes great!

448
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,019
It's because Mi-kun made it.

449
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,188
Mi-kun? Who is that?

450
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,192
He's not my real father,
but he's my dad.

451
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,132
I see...

452
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,068
That was my blind spot.

453
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,139
You're kidding me, right?

456
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,014
Oh, my god...

457
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,483
Wow...

458
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,451
- Welcome home!
- I'm home.

459
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,492
Here...

461
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:35,434
Somehow this feels strange.

462
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,107
I forgot that I actually
love to cook.

463
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,077
He can't eat what I cook now,

464
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,214
but I'm happy enough to have you
to eat the dishes I make.

465
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:53,519
Mom, are you in love with me?

466
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,387
I do love you.

467
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,823
Then...Can I kiss you?

468
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,528
Don't be absurd!

469
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,463
Your friends will laugh at you for
being obsessed with your mom.

470
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:06,131
Sorry, I just want to practice.

471
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:09,301
How awful of you! Use your own hand.

00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,737
Darn!

477
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:49,141
I've got you some information of
different universities. Look.

478
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,676
But it's months away.

479
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,879

- I'm doing my homework. Thanks.

00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,119
Good.

00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,965
Jun, you hang up first.

484
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,934
I'll hang up, then.

00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,271
Okay...

487
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,307
One, two...

488
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:26,412
Hey, you should hang up...
Do hang up this time.

489
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:27,446
Let's hang up.

490
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,148
One...

491
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,118
- What are you doing?
- Who is Jun?

492
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:34,853
My boyfriend.

493
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,189
What? You have a boyfriend?

494
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,192
Of course! I'm in the 2nd year
of my middle school.

495
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,828
What do you do?

496
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,131
Stop asking such childish question.

497
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,036
You know, Naho,

498
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,805
in the world,

499
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,309
there are people who want to fall in
love but force themselves not to.

500
00:32:58,711 --> 00:32:59,511
And?

501
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,815
Go and fall in love, Mihane.

502
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:08,821
"Okonomiyaki Ribon"

503
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,056
Men nowadays are too shy!

504
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:11,990
Why?

505
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:15,594
I think you've drank enough
for today.

506
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:16,862
Gosh...

507
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:21,400
Is Mr. Yano not interested in women?

508
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,535
Are you okay, Mi-kun?

509
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:24,470
Yeah.

510
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,338
Are you okay, Mi-kun?

511
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,607
Yeah, I just got a nosebleed.

512
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,409
I'm okay, it's no big deal.

513
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,177
Gosh...Don't scare me.

514
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,383
Mr. Yano is too closed-off,
really...

515
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,255
What is that?

516
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,491
Light poles and electric cables.

517
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:46,992
Why?

518
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,060
What?

519
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,196
I just thought the combination
is good.

520
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,298
That's often the case.

521
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,467
Well, it is, but...

522
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,073
But somehow,

523
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,612
all of them don't seem like what
you really want to photograph.

524
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,450
Sorry.

525
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,924
I don't know what
I should photograph anyway,

526
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,560
and there is nothing I want to
photograph.

527
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:26,064
You don't have to take photos
of things, do you?

528
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,469
Take a photo of time.

529
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,304
Time?

530
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,241
Which moment you want to save?

531
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,278
That's what I want to see.

532
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,651
Sorry for being arrogant.

533
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,990
But I like photographs.

534
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,361
You can save a certain moment
forever.

535
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,635
That's it!

536
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,703
What?

537
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,446
Perhaps the girl's love...

538
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,517
...can be conveyed using photos.

"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

540
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,256
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

541
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,563
I'm in Higashi High School's
photograph club

542
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:32,965
and I'm looking for a model...

543
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,967
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

544
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,870
Of course she would get suspicious
if I approach her suddenly.

545
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,845
- I'm sorry.
- You don't like taking photos?

546
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:47,679
Please...

547
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,150
I can't be your model.

548
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,553
There is a bug on you...

549
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,725
It's true.
I'm looking for a model...

550
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,199
Oh? It's easy.

551
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,736
I'm very sorry to bother you
when you are busy,

552
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,304
but I'm looking for a model,

553
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:16,074
you look really pretty and I really
hope that you would be my model!

554
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:17,643
What's wrong with you?

555
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,945
Someone, help!

556
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:25,050
I'm not someone suspicious!
Really, I am not!

557
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,158
Do you need any help?

558
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:34,826
Yeah...

559
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,729
I've been looking for a model,

560
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,032
and I've asked that person
many times,

561
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,800
but I kept getting refused.

562
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,070
- It must have been tiring.
- Yeah.

563
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,239
Is there anything
I can help you with?

564
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:49,308
Oh...

565
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:50,809
Yes!

566
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,445
I would like to take some photos,

567
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,781
so would you be my model?

568
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,550
Are you going to submit it to
some competition?

569
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,552
I suppose.

570
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,523
Don't blame me even if
you don't win it, though.

571
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:06,825
I won't!

572
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,595
Finally!

573
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:20,105
I want to get the proof
that you had been in love.

574
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,674
Are you happy with me?

575
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,644
I have never been anybody's model
before...

576
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,448
Actually...

577
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,117
Please get naked.

578
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:33,385
What?

579
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,488
Show me your heart.

580
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,559
What do you mean?

581
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:44,062
If you want to fall in love,
you don't have to hold back.

582
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,066
Think of me as the person you love,

583
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,303
and reveal your love to me.

584
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:01,980
I love you.

585
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,318
I love you.

586
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,286
I love you.

587
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,055
I love you.

588
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,024
I love you.

589
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:14,326
I love you!

590
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,562
The proof that she was in love

591
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,866
isn't something that I can
photograph by asking.

592
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,870
How did I do? Is it good?

593
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,674
It's lovely.

594
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,212
I'm so angry at myself
that my skill is so poor.

595
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,816
I couldn't take a good photo,

596
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,185
and I'm sorry.

597
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,658
How do you know that I'm holding
back my love?

598
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,728
Your heart has been seeking that.

599
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,231
A photographer knows even that?

600
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,735
This is fascinating.

601
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,547
Why don't you tell the person
about your love?

602
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,051
He's my teacher.

603
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,520
I mean the person I love.

604
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,659
I'll confess my love if I got
accepted by the medical school.

605
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,672
This is the last day of her life.

606
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,936
I have to do my maths...

607
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:43,408
Please tell me about your love
next time.

608
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,011
I cannot change her fate.

609
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:48,847
Why?

610
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,923
Why are you crying?

611
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,063
What a weird girl.

612
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:09,267
You're crying like we'll say goodbye
here forever.

613
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,338
Come on, stop crying.

614
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,108
You look lovely, so smile a bit.

615
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,545
I'm looking forward to seeing
the photos.

616
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,716
Just because you can
leap through time,

617
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,485
doesn't mean that you can
change the person's fate.

618
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,726
At least,

619
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,296
I want to live in a way that will
make the heart happy.

620
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,267
Come on.

621
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,386
See you again.

622
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,728
I could not tell her that
her bicycle's brake is broken,

623
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,232
and I saw her off.

624
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,353
"Taken at Izukyu Line's
Shimoda Station, at 20:20..."

625
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:37,055
"She didn't misunderstand
how she felt."

626
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,839
"Social Dance"

627
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:37,515
Mr. Yano?

628
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,285
Oh...Miss Maekawa.

629
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:44,923
I got some free tickets for this.
Would you like to go with me?

630
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,759
It's Barber? That would be great.

631
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,062
If you don't mind...

632
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:53,565
Sure, let's go together.

633
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:54,566
Thanks.

634
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,801
This is good.

635
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,137
Yeah?

636
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,574
I like that one.

637
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,214
It think it's good.

638
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,854
All the photos are good.

639
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,259
They're good.

640
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,229
I like this one, though.

641
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,066
I wish I had taken them better.

642
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,568
The length of time that people
can be in love

643
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,772
is actually very short.

644
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,278
"Life is short,
so fall in love, maiden."

645
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,048
I guess romance is great, too.

646
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:50,989
Oops.

647
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:53,391
- Sorry, I'll take it back now.
- Hey!

648
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,659
It fell...

649
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:57,796
Go on!

650
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,398
You almost got it.

651
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,714
What are you doing?

652
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,850
"Make your crush fall for you
with a kiss."

653
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:22,654
I don't think this is what it means.

654
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,392
- We'll leap through time together?
- Yes...

655
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:28,860
Let's do a class presentation!

656
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,595
A transferred student?
Nobody told me.

657
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,231
You should not fall in love with
someone who is from a different era.

658
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:36,901
Just overcome the obstacle with
the power of love.

659
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:40,105
Please be my Juliet.

660
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:42,440
I want to play Romeo,
no matter what.

661
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,411
We only need three more ingredients
to make it.

662
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,680
He was busy. Let's go!

663
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:51,382
What about Para Para? Look!

664
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,351
Let's give it our best!
