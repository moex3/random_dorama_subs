1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:01,702
One, two...

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,042
I used to play soccer until
I was in middle school...

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,410
One, two...

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,046
But I joined the boat club
in high school.

5
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,147
One, two...

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,322
One, two. Once more! One, two...

7
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,162
Guys, put out a last spurt!

8
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,840
In my last competition,

9
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,111
I just couldn't cry.

10
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,679
Why is that?

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,283
It sounds dubious
if I say this myself,

12
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,385
but I have quite a lot of friends.

13
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,921
But none of them know

14
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,924
how lame I am.

15
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,993
When I had to choose my high school,

16
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,496
my middle school's class teacher
recommended a private one to me,

17
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:06,133
my parents had high hopes that
I might be accepted, too,

18
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,202
but I chose the public school,
Higashi High School.

19
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,571
- It's this month's payment.
- Okay.

20
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,007
My parents thought that I was
worried about the school fee.

21
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:15,509
But no...

22
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,744
Good morning!

23
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,412
- Good morning.
- Gosh...

24
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,915
I wanted to go to the same school
with Mihane.

25
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,086
The reason I joined the boat club,
too...

26
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,657
But Mihane hurt her back
and quitted in her second year.

27
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,959
The reason that I couldn't cry...

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,161
This could be why.

29
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,299
I don't remember when I started
to develop a crush on Mihane.

30
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,668
- Hold Mihane's head up.
- Okay.

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,576
Maybe since I was jealous of
even the pair of scissors?

32
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,945
My dream is to become
a pair of scissors.

33
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,948
He wants to be a pair of scissors!

34
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,951
I was so jealous of the pair of
scissors that cut Mihane's hair.

35
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,253
Come to think of it,
I was a pervert.

36
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,754
Bye bye bi.

37
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:04,158
I made up my mind to confess my love
for her in the Star Festival event,

38
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,695
but my plan failed.

39
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,631
You're in love with Mihane,
aren't you?

40
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,665
What?

41
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,502
Shohei knows that
I'm in love with Mihane...

42
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:19,106
Is it okay for two people to
fall in love with the same person?

43
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,742
What kind of question is that?

44
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,712
And he declared that
he would fight for her with me.

45
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,114
Hey, are you serious?

46
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,049
I don't...

47
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,885
- You almost got it...
- Hang on, I'll get it.

48
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,786
...want to have Mihane
stolen from me by Shohei.

49
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,022
Oh, no! It's sinking!

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,861
What are you doing?

51
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,466
Mihane looked even more adorable
than usual.

52
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,613
Stupid Shohei...

53
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,217
How rude of him to suddenly kiss me!

54
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,120
Anyway, that's not the point!

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,788
I wanted to shout at him,

56
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,591
but I couldn't tell Goro, who didn't
see that.

57
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,627
I thought about doing a time-leap,

58
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,362
but I was hesitant to do so.

59
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,632
It was kind of my first kiss,

60
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,302
so I don't know whether I should
just pretend that it didn't happen.

61
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,772
It won't be gone from my own memory.

62
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,209
Why can you sleep without
worrying about it?

63
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,579
It's annoying to see that!

64
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,217
Mihane did not leap through time.

65
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,254
Does it mean she didn't hate it?

66
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,457
I think I'm more and more
in love with her.

67
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,495
Oh, excuse me...

68
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,564
Hey! We're having a lesson!

69
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,033
A transfer student?
Nobody told me about it.

70
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,483
Okay, let's continue our lesson.

71
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,085
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,990
It was you who told me to enjoy
our time in this era!

73
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,960
Fukamachi, Aihara, raise your hands
if you've got any question.

74
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,362
Yes, sir!

75
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,763
Oops, I haven't got any.

76
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,676
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time
Episode 3"

77
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:51,785
Oh?

78
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,022
I thought Goro was cutting my hair.

79
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,990
Who is Goro?

80
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,962
Oh, come on. It's the friend I grew
up with, Goro Asakura.

81
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,564
The son of Barber Asakura's owner.

82
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,568
Don't feign ignorance.

83
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,071
Do you really not know him?

84
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,779
Where has Shohei gone?

85
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:21,982
- Mihane.
- What?

86
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,150
- Mihane!
- Yes?

87
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,487
- Mihane!
- No...No!

88
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,323
Mihane!

89
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,192
Wake up! It's time for supper.

90
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,261
I've grilled some meat.

91
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,863
Mihane, we're having steak.

92
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,664
Wow, thank you!

93
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,401
It looks delicious! Thanks, mom.

94
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,535
Bon appetit.

95
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:54,081
We only need three more ingredients
to make the potion.

96
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:58,652
I can finally return to the
22nd Century!

97
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,089
Yeah, it will be really soon.

98
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,260
Anyway, "the school"? Why do you
enjoy going to school so much?

99
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,662
"Lessons" are too inefficient!

100
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,230
I mean, everything is written
on the textbook,

101
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,065
why do they copy the text out on a
blackboard

102
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,801
and tell the students to
write it on their notebooks?

103
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,303
This is pointless.

104
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,744
You third year students will have
your college entry exam,

105
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,647
so you don't have to work too hard
for this,

106
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,449
but what is our class performing
in this festival?

107
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,318
The Garyosai Festival.

108
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,788
Will you do anything in your last
school festival?

109
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,090
Well, I guess the first and second
year students

110
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,292
will do most of them,

111
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,928
but I think it's not a bad thing.

112
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,365
It will become a fond memory.
Perhaps a singing performance?

113
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,169
Why don't you do it as a break from
your revision, Tamotsu Hase?

114
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,738
I have to go to cram school
after school.

115
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,342
Mana Tabuchi, you're in
the dance club.

116
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,044
Perhaps you can perform Para Para?

117
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,112
I have to compete in the national
competition soon.

118
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,481
Anyway, what is Para Para?

119
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,885
You don't know what Para Para is?
It's like this.

120
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,654
You don't know this dance?

121
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,993
Then...I guess our class
won't participate in the festival.

122
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,333
"60th Garyosai Festival,
Fujiura Higashi High School"

123
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,708
The class performances
will start soon!

124
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,132
Wow, look at the dance!
Isn't it awesome?

125
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,234
Isn't it amazing?

126
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,638
Only Class 2 of the third year
did a performance.

127
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,373
They are united.

128
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,844
Is that Internet Idol, Onishi,
popular?

129
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,947
She has 200 thousand followers.

130
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,416
200 thousand!

131
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,952
She'll make her major debut soon,

132
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,922
so the whole class is rooting for
Atsumi Onishi.

133
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,356
200 hundred...

134
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,630
Atsumi...

135
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:29,937
Atsumi...

136
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,208
This is the end
of the first school term,

137
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,678
and your summer holiday
begins tomorrow,

138
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,114
but be very careful not to do
something too reckless

139
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:45,385
and bear in mind that you should be
responsible for whatever you do.

140
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,988
Students in their third year should
get down to work and study

141
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,456
for their
university entrance exam...

142
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,794
Summer holiday begins tomorrow,
but we have to attend extra lessons.

143
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,862
It doesn't feel like
summer holiday at all.

144
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,033
I wish we had done
the class performance.

145
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,368
In the Garyosai Festival?

146
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,606
I wanted to do a performance,
actually.

147
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,009
It didn't feel right to voice that.

148
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,179
I wanted to do a performance, too.

149
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,816
What? You, too?

150
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,085
I don't think we can do it
ever again,

151
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,619
and it's our youth.

152
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,155
Actually, I wanted to perform, too!

153
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,457
What?

154
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,426
- Let's do it.
- What? The festival was held.

155
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,565
- Oh!
- You got it.

156
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,835
Come on...

157
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,439
You want us to do a time-leap?

158
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:40,374
Yes...

159
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,576
I definitely think that
we should do a class performance.

160
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,543
Let's do it.

161
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,612
But will our classmates agree
to do it?

162
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,414
They will, if we can persuade them.

163
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:48,982
We will help you, too.

164
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,984
- Please...
- Please!

165
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,619
Please...

166
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:56,757
This.

167
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,759
The Garyosai Festival.

168
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,262
- What?
- Oh, my god...

169
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,966
Guys, let's do a class performance!

170
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,169
It's the last time in high school,
let's do it together!

171
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,243
Hey, Goro, Shohei,
help me persuade them..

172
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,110
Hang on.

173
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,047
I don't want to perform
in front of so many people.

174
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,983
But actually you want to do it,
don't you?

175
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,886
No, not really...

176
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,157
You traitors!

177
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,958
Wait...

178
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,127
Don't be so forceful!

179
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,863
You said you would help me!

180
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,899
But that's what our future selves
said a few days later.

181
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,968
Our present selves
have never heard it.

182
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,739
We said we would persuade our
classmate and do the performance!

183
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,908
But it was difficult to do so
at that time.

184
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,377
But you said you could!

185
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,512
Did I say that?

186
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,147
You did, in the future!

187
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,983
That means, you didn't. Not yet.

188
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,886
The point isn't whether
he said it or not!

189
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,988
You'll regret it if you don't do it!

190
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:03,924
Got it?

191
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,792
Got it?

192
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,869
I think this will become a fond
memory for our whole class,

193
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,005
so we'll definitely do
a successful performance.

194
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,542
I will do something about it.

195
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,883
You don't want to?

196
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,120
We don't know what we're going to
do, so it's hard to answer that.

197
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,990
Well, we haven't decided it yet.

198
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,092
What about Para Para? Look.

199
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,661
We don't want our performance
to be a failure.

200
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:44,798
Here?

201
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,367
- Hase, you're right.
- Well.

202
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,470
Class, you really don't know
what Para Para is?

203
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,006
Let's perform Para Para!

204
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,610
There...you go...

205
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,479
Watermelon!

206
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,915
You like watermelon?

207
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,951
It's so much more than "like".

208
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,922
I had it for the first time the
other day and I got addicted.

209
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,959
You had it for the first time
the other day, huh?

210
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,929
We might sing together
or do a dance performance...

211
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,498
But some people might not want to
perform in front of people...

212
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,901
I think we should let them
work backstage.

213
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,169
Oh...

214
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,241
Why are you eating watermelon alone?

215
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,612
- Would you have some with me?
- No, I won't!

216
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,582
That's not the point!
Think and come up with some idea!

217
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,085
- Watermelon burst.
- Forget your watermelon!

218
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:43,023
It must be hard to get someone to
work when they don't want to.

219
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,659
But if only a part of people are
excited about it,

220
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,827
doesn't it make you feel lonely?

221
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:52,065
If we're doing it, I want us to
create a great memory together.

222
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,169
I am exactly the kind of person who
doesn't like doing things together.

223
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,572
What? I'm surprised.

224
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,008
The cool guys would enjoy events
held at school,

225
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,678
and I used to think that it was
boring for some reason.

226
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,982
But when I look at you, I think
maybe I shouldn't have thought that.

227
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,786
We used to strongly refuse to
participate in the school's events,

228
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,256
so perhaps they used to think hard
to come up with ways

229
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,126
to get us to participate
and enjoy the events.

230
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,297
Hey, Yuri, perhaps you can go
and participate too.

231
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,733
Oh, I would love to!
Do I look like a high school girl?

232
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,235
No, you don't look like one at all.

233
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,003
Keita!

234
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,177
It must be difficult for
the three of them.

235
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,045
They have to perform soon, right?

236
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,147
I don't mean the preparation,

237
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,049
I mean their love triangle.

238
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,819
Is that so? Shohei, too?

239
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,121
Well, Mihane is cute.

240
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,032
Let's do a play!

241
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,533
A play?

242
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,003
It's the most difficult performance
of all...

243
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,070
What's the title?

244
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,840
Romeo and Juliet.

245
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,846
I know you're worried,

246
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,648
but when I was thinking

247
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,218
what the whole class can participate
and enjoy,

248
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:19,953
it's a surprisingly good idea.

249
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,188
Some people can work backstage,

250
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,191
and we need people to make the
props, costumes and backdrops,

251
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,627
so I think you can all do
what you're good at.

252
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,332
You don't want to do it?

253
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,669
Sorry!

254
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,444
I want to play Romeo,
no matter what.

255
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:51,418
I'm really sorry for dragging you
guys into this.

256
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,421
But I really hope that you'd help to
make my selfish wish come true.

257
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:56,956
Thanks in advance!

258
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,327
Goro! Why did you say that? You want
to make my efforts go in vain?

259
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,663
Well, I guess we have to,
if Asakura asks for our help.

260
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,564
- What?
- Indeed.

261
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,333
I have to participate in a
competition soon,

262
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,401
so I don't know how much I can do...

263
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,537
It's okay, just do as much
as you can.

264
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,007
I'll help you with whatever
I can, too.

265
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,041
- Good.
- Me, too!

266
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:15,909
Thanks!

267
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,280
Now everyone of us will participate?

268
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,548
Good!

269
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,952
Why are you not happy?

270
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,988
We could've started sooner if you'd
persuaded them at the beginning!

271
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,092
You see how much other classmates
like you, stupid nice guy.

272
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,193
You're angry?

273
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,095
Was it a compliment?

274
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,031
You're so annoying!

275
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm depressed...I'm so depressed.

276
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,569
Come on...

277
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,538
Everyone wants to do it now,
so isn't it great?

278
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,941
Please say it if you want to
play a certain role.

279
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,776
I want to make the costumes.

280
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,845
- Costumes?
- I'll do that with her.

281
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,413
Would you like to do
the choreography?

282
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,150
Sure, but I'm a strict teacher.

283
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,386
What...I'll make the props?

284
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,988
Goro will be Romeo, right?

285
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,491
I think Shohei will make
a good Laurence.

286
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,525
What?

287
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,796
- I'd like to see that.
- Why not?

288
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:10,864
I'll do that?

289
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,201
Now, Juliet's Nurse...

290
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,469
Me!

291
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,872
I'll play Juliet's Nurse.

292
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,173
You sure it's okay
for a man to play her?

293
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,841
Why not? It's new!

294
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,544
- I think it will be funny!
- Indeed!

295
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,281
Okay, thank you, Mr. Yano!

296
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,883
Thank you!

297
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,420
Those who haven't gotten a role
are Mihane

298
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:34,654
and Aihara.

299
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,160
One of them will be Juliet and the
other will do the backdrop.

300
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,997
Well, I'm the one who suggested
playing Romeo and Juliet,

301
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,533
so I'll do whatever that is left.

302
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,068
Aihara, please choose one.

303
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,277
- I'll be Juliet.
- What?

304
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm very sorry...

305
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,982
So, we're all set?

306
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,120
We're all set!

307
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,621
Are you happy to work backstage?

308
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,460
Lovely. Thank you!

309
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,929
Juliet?

310
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,165
Why are you Juliet?

311
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,869
The name in that line
should be Romeo.

312
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,737
It wasn't the line!
I mean your role!

313
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,072
Oh, my role.

314
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,208
Are you really doing it?

315
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,944
But if I have to make the backdrop,

316
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,413
I'll have to draw pictures, right?

317
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,116
I don't like to get my hands dirty,
so it's impossible.

318
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,818
So you'll play the heroine?

319
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,654
It's better than making
my hands dirty.

320
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,690
What? "Better"?

321
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,793
You shouldn't choose to play the
heroine because it's "better"...

322
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,096
What? Where has Shohei gone?

323
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,166
No idea.

324
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,534
What?

325
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,005
I'll go and look for Shohei.
Please go and return the key.

326
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,511
Not here.

327
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:07,881
There he is.

328
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,229
Oh? Where is Shohei?

329
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,832
- He was busy.
- What?

330
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,367
Never mind. Let's go!

331
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,203
Why are you angry?

332
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,438
Sorry, I was late...

333
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,778
They left without me...

334
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,454
I'm home.

335
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,990
Welcome home. We have a visitor.

336
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,092
He says he would like to
talk to you.

337
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,795
Welcome home.

338
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,163
What?

339
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,867
Are you in love with Mihane?

340
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,168
What?

341
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,404
Well...

342
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,005
Yeah.

343
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,908
Give it up, then.

344
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,276
What?

345
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,579
Which year were you born in?

346
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,715
Why ask that out of the blue?

347
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,917
You're not from this era, right?

348
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,564
Just like you,

349
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,199
I came from the future.

350
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,705
Go back at once.

351
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,740
What are you doing in this era?

352
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,877
I lost my potion,
so I can't go back.

353
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,112
What?

354
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,780
What a fool...

355
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,482
What are you going to do?

356
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,552
I've extracted the necessary
ingredients

357
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,656
and I'm making the potion again
from scratch.

358
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,491
You're a researcher?

359
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,761
I should be the one asking
what are you doing here.

360
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,463
I'm living here with my family.

361
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,567
I decided to stay in this era.

362
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,970
It's not about me.

363
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,772
Anyway, give up on starting
a relationship with Mihane.

364
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,741
I'm asking you why I should.

365
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,710
You should not fall in love with
a girl from a different era.

366
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,413
You have the guts to say that?

367
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,916
You have your own family here.

368
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,620
I have warned you.

369
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,088
Give up that idea.

370
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,095
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

371
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,998
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

372
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,834
Aihara will play Juliet.

373
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,703
Who is Aihara?

374
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,371
Why isn't it Mihane?

375
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,106
I wish Mihane would play Juliet!

376
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,341
Exactly!

377
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,176
Can't you do something about it?

378
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,010
No, I can't.

379
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,979
Why didn't you tell Mihane to do it?

380
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,380
Exactly!

381
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,418
Welcome...

382
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,254
Hello.

383
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,457
- The gown, please.
- Okay.

384
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,760
- It's lovely.
- Yeah, I think so.

385
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,029
Ow...

386
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,498
- Which one?
- This one.

387
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,403
Are you okay, Hase?

388
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:19,572
Why did you kill my friend?

389
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,340
Now, change positions!

390
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,378
Hatakeda, get more serious.

391
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:32,985
Juliet took the potion and it
wrought on her the form of death.

392
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,957
She was actually alive...

393
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,992
Alas...

394
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,994
Alas!

395
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:46,899
Five more days to go!

396
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,303
- Which way is it? This?
- This way.

397
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,607
- One more spin?
- Then turn...

398
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,409
This way.

399
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,030
Four more days to go!

400
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,738
Wait...Hang on...

401
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,006
Excuse me.

402
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,841
We'll measure his shoulders' width.

403
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,378
His shoulders are 51 centimeters
wide...

404
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,980
Not yet...We're not done with you.

405
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,082
- Do you have to do it now?
- Yes.

406
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,784
Three more days to go!

407
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:42,421
Fly in the sky with
your wings of love!

408
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:44,290
Okay!

409
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,992
Your soft lips...

410
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,428
- cannot say my name again...
- Done! Hey...

411
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:49,462
Try it on.

412
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,502
It's torn!

413
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:57,703
Sorry.

414
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:01,274
Romeo isn't the only man in this
world, Madam.

415
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,917
Two more days to go.

416
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,386
Let's work for a while more.

417
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,156
One more day to go!

418
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,091
Would you dance with me?

419
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,962
I'm sorry!

420
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:24,697
Okay...

421
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,199
I'm sorry...

422
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,301
What?

423
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,239
Drink this distilled liquor.

424
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,775
In this borrowed...

425
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,178
Didn't it break too easily?

426
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:45,117
Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

427
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,387
Romeo!

428
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,924
She's horrible.
Can she not speak properly?

429
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,092
Romeo!

430
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,595
What's the next line?

431
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,731
"He thought I was really dead."

432
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,969
- He thought I was really dead.
- Okay...

433
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,003
Stab the knife in your chest.

434
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,004
You are ridiculous!

435
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,106
- "Stab the knife in..."
- No...

436
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,214
Thank you all for your efforts.

437
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,318
We'll finally do our play tomorrow.

438
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:24,657
Well, I think we're all worried
about many things...

439
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:25,992
"Many things"?

440
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,129
Just "many things"?

441
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,737
If just one person
doesn't want to do this,

442
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,672
everything we've done
will be in vain.

443
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,980
Hey! I'm talking about you!

444
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,918
I don't blame you for your bad
acting, but at least be serious!

445
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,888
- But I am.
- We can't feel that at all!

446
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,757
The national competition
will be held soon,

447
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,192
and I should be putting my efforts
on that!

448
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,528
But I want to do it well
if I am doing it.

449
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,397
It just annoys me
when you don't even care.

450
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,398
Well!

451
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,367
We didn't have much time
to rehearse,

452
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,503
and the heroine has to remember
a lot of lines.

453
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:13,606
Fix the props that you broke.

454
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,244
And why do I have to make the props
to begin with?

455
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,747
What? Hase, you actually wanted
to play a role?

456
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,885
I should have volunteered to
play Juliet.

457
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,087
It would be funny, at least.

458
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,490
- Yeah, indeed, it would be.
- Well, yeah.

459
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,359
I'll quit.

460
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,095
- Aihara!
- Hang on.

461
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,497
I did work hard for my part.

462
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,834
I stayed awake at night to practice
and that was the best I can do!

463
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,405
Though I have done my best, you
still said I didn't seem to have.

464
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:53,379
I actually can't do this.
Sorry for being self-assertive.

465
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,151
Wait, Aihara, I'll teach you
how to act.

466
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,154
That's why I told you
not to do this...

467
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,361
What should we do?

468
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,695
- It's tomorrow.
- Will it be okay?

469
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:12,965
Hase!

470
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,801
Are you really playing Juliet?

471
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,537
Wait...We'll do the play tomorrow.

472
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,505
It's impossible.

473
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,875
If it's not tomorrow,

474
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,512
- you'll say yes?
- What?

475
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,081
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

476
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,650
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

477
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:31,984
What...

478
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,819
We'll return to the time
we assign the roles!

479
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,689
It's too much of a trouble to
explain to him, so come with me!

480
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,157
Come with you? How?

481
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,527
I held a turtle in my hand when I
did a time-leap for the first time.

482
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,295
If the turtle could do it with me...

483
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:48,734
What? But human and turtle
are different.

484
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,903
Just shut up and close your eyes.

485
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:54,040
Think strongly back to the time
we assign the roles.

486
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,954
What's the matter?

487
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,689
Seriously?

488
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,625
What the heck?

489
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,460
It was amazing!

490
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,761
Let's correct this.

491
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,999
Though we've assigned most of
the roles, I'm very sorry!

492
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,700
I have a suggestion now.

493
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,837
Isn't it more interesting to let a
guy play Juliet?

494
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,605
That's what I thought, too.

495
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,844
Well said, Hase!
Then will you be Juliet?

496
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,480
What...Why should I play Juliet?

497
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,583
Hase, you actually want to
play a role, right?

498
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,218
No, I don't.

499
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,286
Really?

500
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,321
Why do you ask me that?

501
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,957
That role shouldn't be played by me.

502
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,959
I want to make props!

503
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,128
That's not what you said.

504
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,330
Why don't you play Juliet, Shohei?

505
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:52,998
No, I mean, Julio.

506
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,535
What...Me?

507
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,939
Asakura and Fukamachi playing
Romeo and Juliet...

508
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,541
Gosh, it's erotic.

509
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,077
What are you fantasizing?

510
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,846
Indeed! It's a good idea!

511
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:07,980
What?

512
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,282
Then who will play Lawrence?

513
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:12,718
Well, I'll play him.

514
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:13,919
Good!

515
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,355
The person who hasn't got a part...

516
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:19,792
Aihara.

517
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,361
Will you make the backdrop?

518
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,332
I have to make it, haven't I?

519
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,502
Fine!

520
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,403
I'll do it...

521
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,840
Let's give it our best.

522
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,317
This is the best I can do...

523
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,386
I'm sorry...

524
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,524
I thought you said
you were not good at this?

525
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,293
I just said I hate to
get my hands dirty.

526
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,961
Whoa! It's so dirty!

527
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,298
Thank you for
the wonderful backdrop!

528
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,369
Thank you so much!

529
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,804
I'm glad that you're happy!

530
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,873
- I'm so impressed!
- Amazing!

531
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,009
She is the best artist!

532
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,947
"Lesson five."

533
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,484
"Shout out your love boldly..."

534
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,287
No way...

535
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:22,988
Shohei, dinner is ready!

536
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:23,989
Coming!

537
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,761
I tried to make dishes
with watermelon.

538
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,463
Wow...

539
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,967
Bon appetit...

540
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,007
- Yummy!
- Glad to hear that.

541
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,577
Watermelon?

542
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,246
Watermelon.

543
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,049
Wherefore art thou watermelon?

544
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,483
The forbidden love?

545
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,786
When we are forced to be apart,

546
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,121
it makes me love you more.

547
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,324
It's the Romeo and Juliet effect,
right?

548
00:30:59,024 --> 00:30:59,959
Such effect exists?

549
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,093
When there is an obstacle,

550
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,362
you'd want to overcome it and you
get more passionate.

551
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,198
Just overcome it.

552
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,235
Obstacle is nothing
in front of the power of love.

553
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,171
Yes, indeed.

554
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,709
Drink this distilled liquor.

555
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:21,380
In this borrowed likeness of shrunk
death, you shall continue two days.

556
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,150
If I can be with Romeo,

557
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:27,553
I will do anything.

558
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,422
You have made up your mind?

559
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:31,857
Yes.

560
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,700
Your soft lips cannot say
my name again.

561
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,670
My only love...

562
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,538
The love between you

563
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,909
will certainly defuse the conflict.

564
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,912
I shall go to the peaceful kingdom,
where you are waiting.

565
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,149
I shall come to you!

566
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,118
When I learned of this...

567
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,254
it was already too late.

568
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:06,458
Please trust your beloved
and be persistent in your love.

569
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,329
It's today!

570
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:15,534
"60th Garyosai Festival,
Fujiura Higashi High School"

571
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,171
- Okay!
- Ready...

572
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,539
A bit to the left.

573
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,943
We now only have to fully enjoy
ourselves and let's make it work!

574
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,379
Third year, Class 6.

575
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,581
Let's give it our best!

576
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,690
I am Julio!

577
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:40,125
I'm madly in love with Romeo!

578
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,461
Madam Julio!

579
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,229
Madam Julio!

580
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,900
It's time to do the Para Para dance
in the morning.

581
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,205
Now, cheer up!

582
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,007
Madam!

583
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,785
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

584
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,023
Because my grandfather...

585
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:13,459
...named me Romeo.

586
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,595
My family are fans of Giants,

587
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,997
but your family are fans of Hanshin!

588
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,367
So please, I beg you,

589
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,536
stop being a fan of
the Hanshin Tigers!

590
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,839
Asakura, hurry!

591
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,908
Nobody told me the girls would help
me change! Get the guys here!

592
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,677
You do it...It's embarrassing!

593
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:47,626
Why?

594
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,329
Why did you kill my friend?

595
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,532
Why do I need a reason?

596
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,504
- Darn you, Tybalt!
- Romeo!

597
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:24,129
You can feign your death
after drinking this potion!

598
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,998
So I'll just drink this

599
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,067
and make myself dead, right?

600
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,068
Yes.

601
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:34,840
Please remember to take the right
dose properly.

602
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,743
Thank you, Lawrence!

603
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,879
Good luck.

604
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,451
Thank you, Lawrence...

605
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,456
Everything went as planned.

606
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,458
It'll be perfect if the last scene
goes all right.

607
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:00,833
Julio!

608
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,736
Julio!

609
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,007
Why?

610
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,877
Why did you leave without me?

611
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,584
Julio!

612
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,257
What...

613
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,299
It's that basketball.

614
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,777
What should we do, Mihane?

615
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,815
Anyway, we have to help Goro...

616
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,284
Oh, no!

617
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,957
Oh, no...

618
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,193
Oh, my god!

619
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:03,595
Oh, no...

620
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,631
This is really bad...

621
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:12,004
Why is Romeo dead?

622
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,408
I won't forgive you for dying alone!

623
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,553
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

624
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,689
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

625
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:04,923

627
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:21,873
Sorry.

628
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:25,944
Sorry for making you guys worried.

629
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,313
Are you okay?

630
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,083
I thought I was going to die.

631
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,719
But I'm totally fine now.

632
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,555
Guys, I'm really sorry.

633
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,523
Glad to hear that...

634
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:39,758
What do you want to do?

635
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,627
Do you want to do it again
and correct it?

636
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,831
Yeah, before the show starts,

637
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,600
I'll tell Goro about the basketball.

638
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:53,505
This time, I have to make the play
a successful one!

639
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,273
Okay.

640
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,508
Let's go back.

641
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:05,017
Asakura looked so funny
the moment he passed out, though.

642
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:10,188
Yeah, but Shohei's last pose
was fantastic, too.

643
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,724
The audience laughed so hard
and we got a standing ovation.

644
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:16,595
And the moment when the painting
Aihara worked so hard on broke,

645
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:17,796
I saw it in slow motion.

646
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,531
Yeah, same here...

647
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,967
It broke because I tripped
on something.

648
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,902
I am very sorry!

649
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,705
But it ended in a climax that was
more excited than the original one.

650
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,774
Well said, Hase!

651
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:35,347
I guess it's not necessary
to go back and make it perfect.

652
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,317
Everyone here is smiling happily.

653
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,598
I enjoyed it a lot.

654
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,842
I don't want to change it.

655
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,979
It ended in an unexpected way,

656
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,816
but I think we've all enjoyed
our last Garyosai Festival,

657
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,250
and I'm really touched!

658
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,552
Now...

659
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,488
Let's toast to
our miraculous failure.

660
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,924
Cheers!

661
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,560
Cheers...

662
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,030
Thank you!

663
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,298
Oh, sorry...

664
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,101
Okay, say cheese!

665
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,069
You're close...

666
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,006
Fantastic!

667
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,844
I'm glad that we did the
performance.

668
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,715
Youth is worthless
if without failure.

669
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,352
I can say that now.

670
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,757
Failure is fantastic.

671
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,861
Failing is fantastic!

672
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,196
Failing is fantastic...

673
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,133
Failing is fantastic...

674
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,069
Failing is fantastic!

675
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,209
Hase!

676
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,711
Well done, Hase!

677
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,446
Go!

678
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,518
Fantastic!

679
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:26,391
Failing is fantastic...

680
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,260
Okay!

681
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,773
I'd like to take this opportunity

682
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,309
to say something.

683
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,716
Mihane Yoshiyama!

684
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,087
You do everything
with all your might,

685
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,256
and I love you for that.

686
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:01,927
He loves her?

687
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,930
I love you!

688
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,475
What...

689
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:26,885
Please...

690
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,055
Be my Juliet.

691
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,293
Juliet...

692
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:40,565
Juliet...

693
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:45,303
Juliet...

694
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:49,875
Juliet...

695
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,184
Juli...

696
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:01,586
Juliet...

697
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:03,488
Juliet...

698
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,070
Kiss her...

699
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,741
Kiss her...

700
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,380
Kiss her...

701
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:08,820
Kiss her...

702
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:16,494
Kiss her...

703
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:24,336
Kiss her...

704
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,275
Kiss her...

705
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:44,889
"Okonomiyaki, Ribon"

706
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,425
I love the way you acted, Mr. Yano!

707
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,529
I'm just a radish.

708
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,433
I absolutely love dishes made
with radish!

709
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,235
Oh, do you?

710
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,269
Okay...

711
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,305
If you don't mind,

712
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:05,143
would you give me a personal lesson
and teach me how to act?

713
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,346
- Please!
- Another glass of beer, please!

714
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:11,649
Don't be so mean! Please!
Just teach me a bit!

715
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,052
- Mr. Miura?
- Just for a bit...

716
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,820
Is he too shy?

717
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,888
Mr. Miura!

718
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,391
- Mr. Miura, are you okay?
- Mr. Miura!

719
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,126
- Please call an ambulance!
- Okay.

720
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:25,063
Mr. Miura...
Hang in there, Mr. Miura!

721
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:54,526
Oh?

722
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,930
I can't find any photo of Shohei.

723
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,112
"Class trip in Okinawa"

724
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,381
"We're always close! And always in
the same class, too!"

725
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:18,750
Why?

726
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,054
Shohei isn't here.

727
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,125
I'm happy that you confessed
your love.

728
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:30,462
Will our romance end when she knows
my real identity?

729
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:33,431
Why don't you have photos
of your childhood?

730
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,166
Why can't I live my life
the way I want?

731
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,901
- Goro...
- Goro!

732
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:40,004
I was in love with you, too!

733
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,041
Break up with Mihane and go back.
It's for your sake.

734
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:46,111
I'm tired of being Goro Asakura.

735
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,512
What is "the real you"?

736
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:50,648
I don't want to be left alone again.

737
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,317
I won't leave you on your own.

738
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,586
I want to be with you no matter
what, Mihane.
