1
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,708
What...Hey, what are you...

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,010
Come on!

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,679
You're heavy!

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,982
Let's go picnic...Picnic...

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,617
Why?

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,453
I want to go to an amusement park.

7
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,689
The three of us will go together,
right?

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,326
Just you and me.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,731
Why? What about Shohei? The three of
us are always together.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,468
We won't tell him.

11
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,071
We'll have more fun without him.

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,407
Somehow you sound weird.

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,410
We are a couple now...

14
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,317
What?

15
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,245
Mihane Yoshiyama!

16
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,949
You do everything
with all your might,

17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,084
and I love you for that.

18
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,589
I love you!

19
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,697
Please be my Juliet.

20
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,506
Please don't escape from
this moment.

21
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,275
I want a romance
that won't disappear.

22
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,952
If she knows who I am,

23
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,855
will our love end, too?

24
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,859
I have rewritten her memory...

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,063
...in a way that will give me
an advantage.

26
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,831
You look like a Kokeshi doll.

27
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,900
Kokeshi doll?

28
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,805
No, Shohei rescued you
with all his might.

29
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,077
Shohei rescued me
with all his might.

30
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,647
The holes in our love
are filled with lies...

31
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,552
It won't become real, will it?

32
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,356
What are you doing?

33
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,024
You've slept too much.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,629
Going on a picnic is nice,

35
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,366
but going to an amusement park
is nice, too.

36
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,737
Let's start our day from
the morning again.

37
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,173
What? Are you sure?

38
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,742
Sure.

39
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,083
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time
Episode 4"

40
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,793
It's an amusement park! Wow!

41
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,261
Let's go for a ride
on the roller coaster!

42
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,529
What is that?

43
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,033
What? You don't know what
roller coaster is?

44
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,335
I've never been to an amusement park
before.

45
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,171
You've missed out a lot
in your life!

46
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
- You're joking!
- Let's go.

47
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,343
You'll learn about the conjunction,
so that, today.

48
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,879
We'll start from doing a translation
of a sentence.

49
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,282
"The water was so cold."

50
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,752
It means...

51
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,925
Wow!

52
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,028
What?

53
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,331
I won't let you off.

54
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,199
Please get on the roller coaster.

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,668
Okay!

56
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,106
The roller coaster ride
will begin soon.

57
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,442
- Get on your way to heaven!
- See you!

58
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,110
Saying that brings bad luck!

59
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,046
No!

60
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,716
- Idiot! Idiot!
- It's going down!

61
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,151
I can't stand it!

62
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,329
Ride again!

63
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,964
- Ride again!
- No way...Seriously, no way!

64
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,233
Mom!

65
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,904
My DNA tells me that
I can't do this!

66
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,775
- We'll take another ride...
- Spare my life, please...

67
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,384
Encore...

68
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,827
I guess we should get off
the roller coaster.

69
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,495
Yeah?

70
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,566
- It's so good!
- Yummy!

71
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,471
They didn't notice us, right?

72
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,842
No.

73
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:19,046
But that's what youth should be.

74
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,081
You're staring for too long.

75
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,586
I'm full now...

76
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,788
- Ouch!
- What?

77
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,090
They fell at the same time.

78
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,759
You're too loud.

79
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,293
Bon appetit...

80
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,795
It looks delicious!

81
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,563
They suddenly fell...

82
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,999
They'll see us!

83
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:45,506
Hamburger, aha...
Hamburger, oh, yeah...

84
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:50,010
Can you see which part of the
sentence is defined

85
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,814
by the relative pronoun, who?

86
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,950
If you look at the verb here...

87
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,988
That cloud looks like a lion.

88
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,290
It's a safari in the sky.

89
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,195
Look! That's a fat kangaroo, right?

90
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,734
To its left, it's either
an elephant's nose...

91
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,804
Oh! The polar bear is
standing on its hands!

"Barber Asakura"

93
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,676
Welcome home!
We've been talking about you.

94
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,778
You might be accepted by
the medical school, I heard.

95
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,148
I just got lucky in the mock exam.

96
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,817
When you become a doctor,
please marry Mihane.

97
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,587
We're all very happy to have Mihane
as one of our family.

98
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,856
We'll dye your white hair for free
when they get married.

99
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,857
Really?

100
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,825
My daughter isn't the most
well-mannered,

101
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,826
but please take care of her.

102
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,329
What? You'll give us your daughter
for free hair coloring services?

103
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,797
Wow, you're horrible!

104
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,800
Well, Mihane is sitting her
university entrance exam, too,

105
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,068
but she's going to the amusement
park with her friend today.

106
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,870
Wow, she is confident.

107
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,238
No, I don't think she can be.

108
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,540
You can't really go out so carefree
at a time like this...

109
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,675
"University Entrance Exam 2017"

110
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,567
Welcome.

111
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,837
The usual haircut?

112
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,241
Okay.

113
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,533
You look lovely.

114
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,939
I wanted to make you beautiful,
but...

115
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,276
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

116
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,580
Go and do your revision. I'll tell
you when supper is ready.

117
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,215
Oops, I forgot the natto.

118
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,251
Gosh...

119
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,420
I don't want to sit for the exam.

120
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,255
What?

121
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,490
So I won't go to medical school.

122
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,427
I won't go to college, too.

123
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,495
Darling...

124
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,998
Darling!

125
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,304
Okay...Welcome...

126
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,341
Oh? Where is the customer?

127
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,177
Goro said that he wouldn't go to sit
for the university entrance exam.

128
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,278
What?

129
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,415
What are you going to do
if you're not go to a university?

130
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,718
I'll do what I want to do.

131
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,386
What you want to do?

132
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,755
You don't mean you want to succeed
this shop, do you?

133
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,827
Give up the idea.
You're not cut out for it.

134
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,161
Don't just assume that.

135
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,164
There is no future for you
if you stay here.

136
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,166
You have to think properly
about your future.

137
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,369
- I am doing it.
- Why?

138
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,237
You're worrying about the fee?

139
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,905
No, I'm not...

140
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,242
I just don't want to do it.

141
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,812
Don't just think about
what you want.

142
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,482
Why do you want to succeed
the shop so desperately?

143
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,951
It has always been my dream.

144
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,387
What kind of dream is that?

145
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,922
Don't decide your future by
unrealistic things

146
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,791
like motivation and dreams.

147
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,626
Face your own ability!

148
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,927
Gosh...

149
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,333
It's a shame that my parents can't
even help me to pursue my dream.

150
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,868
It's a real shame.

151
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,202
Then, what?

152
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,073
Parents have to be affirmative about
their children's every single dream?

153
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,674
I don't think so.

154
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:18,345
Don't mistake your impulse
for your dream.

155
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,483
Okay, I'll ask you.

156
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,120
Are you going to ignore your mom's
and my expectation for you?

157
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,689
- Darling...
- Gosh, you're so annoying.

158
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,527
It's my own life, why can't I do
what I want to?

159
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,162
Don't decide it for me!

160
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,832
Your expectation is nothing
but a nuisance.

161
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,175
Darn you!

162
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,159
You really want to become a barber,
don't you?

163
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,694
I've been saying it
for my whole life.

164
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,896
Fine!

165
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,900
But I won't let you succeed
this shop.

166
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,837
If you want to be a barber,
go somewhere and be one.

167
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,607
Fine.

170
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,422
The paella is gorgeous!

171
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,359
- It's so good!
- Yummy!

172
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,193
I put a lot of effort in it

173
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,928
and I have been making them
since yesterday.

174
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,898
Since yesterday? Oh, thank you!

175
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,567
You're welcome. I love having people
eat the dishes I make.

176
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,038
It's so good! Hang on, what is this?

177
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,908
I wrapped pieces of apple with pork.

178
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,344
Is that a film camera?

179
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,512
Yes, it is.

180
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,447
It is really good.

181
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,150
- Can I take some photos?
- Of course!

182
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,587
Okay.

183
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,490
You don't really see cameras like
that now.

184
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,492
No, you don't...

185
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,499
That reminds me. I haven't got a
single photo of Shohei at home.

186
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,669
We've been growing up together,
so I can't help but wonder.

187
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,440
Shohei's childhood photos...

188
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,878
I wonder if we have any at home...

189
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,315
What? You must have some, right?
Like photo albums.

190
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,818
I think so...Oh, hang on, mom!

191
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,553
Hey, Shohei,

192
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,156
why haven't you got
any childhood photos?

193
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,458
Hey, this is really delicious.
What is it?

194
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,693
I wrapped pieces of apple with pork.

195
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,963
But...Why do you wrap pieces of
apple with pork?

196
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,844
Mihane, it's ringing.

197
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:19,612
There you go.

198
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,782
- Hello?
- Mihane?

199
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,585
Are you with Goro now?

200
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,488
Goro? No, I'm not.

201
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,190
I'll let Goro's mom speak to you.

202
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,194
I'm Mrs. Asakura.
Sorry for calling all of a sudden.

203
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,530
Goro hasn't come home
after he went out.

204
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,634
What? He ran away from home?
Have you called his mobile?

205
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,503
He left it at home.

206
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,338
It's fine if he's okay,

207
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:50,009
but if there is the slightest chance
that he had an accident...Oh, gosh.

208
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,112
Where would a high school
student go? Manga cafe?

209
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,114
It's summer after all,
maybe he went camping?

210
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,815
- Camping?
- Let me speak to her.

211
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,618
Mihane, will you ask your friends
for us?

212
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,453
Oh, I'm sorry! Good grief!

213
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,960
Goro...

214
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,162
Goro.

215
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,399
Where have you gone?

216
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,734
Seriously?

217
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,570
Thank you very much.

220
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,553
Hello? I still haven't found him.

221
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,356
If anything happened to Asakura...

222
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,191
I will die.

223
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,860
If you die, Ojo, it will get
even more complicated.

224
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,763
Goro!

225
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,799
Goro!

226
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,168
Darn...Seriously?

227
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,582
Where has he gone?

228
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,718
Anyway,

229
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,489
maybe he'd think that he would lose
the fight if he went home too soon.

230
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,258
I guess we have to go back.

231
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,960
To when he ran away from home.

232
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,128
Let's go.

233
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,567
Why?

234
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:26,039
You look like you're not going to
take me with you.

235
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,007
Oh, it's not what I'm thinking,
but...

236
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,075
But?

237
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,513
I think I'd better go alone.

238
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,714
Why?

239
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,954
I think Goro will not feel
comfortable if you're there, too.

240
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:44,190
Why? I'm worried about Goro, too.

241
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,496
Hang on.

242
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,898
Does Goro...actually hate me?

243
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,736
Well, that's not...

244
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,372
That's not a problem, then.
Let's go.

245
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,910
His mom said that he left home
at after 7 o'clock, right?

246
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,044
Yeah.

247
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,689
The Star Festival Event? Why?

248
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,592
I got it wrong! We'll do it again.

249
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:25,198
You have to hang up.
Do hang up this time.

250
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,802
I said, you hang up first, Jun.

251
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,304
Oh, no!

252
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,439
- This is my room!
- Oh, that's...

253
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,908
Oh?

254
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,011
No, it's nothing.

255
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,916
Why?

256
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,718
What? It's a stomach band?

257
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,858
- Once more. One, two...
- Okay.

258
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,296
Why are we here again?

259
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,897
- It's weird!
- You're kidding me!

260
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,666
I can't go back to the
time I wanted to!

261
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,668
- Idiot! Idiot!
- Oh, no!

262
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,769
Oh, my god!

263
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,378
We're back to the bus station
from the amusement park!

264
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,716
He'll run away from home in
15 minutes! Let's go, Shohei!

265
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,052
I can't...I'm too tired!

266
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,420
Run!

267
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,128
Goro will...

268
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,797
Goro!

269
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,373
There he is!

270
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,179
Don't go!

271
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,448
Mihane?

272
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,860
Why?

273
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,865
It's so hot...

274
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,073
Have you leapt through time
to stop me, by any chance?

00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,322
Why did you run away from home?

278
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,291
I told them that I don't want to sit
for the university entrance exam.

279
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:38,665
Then they said that I shouldn't
ignore their expectations for me.

280
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:43,169
But you've been saying that you want
to be a barber.

281
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,471
My dad said that I'm not cut out for
it, so I should give up.

282
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,140
But you never know!

283
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,411
I'm supportive, though,

284
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,113
of your dream, Goro.

285
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,651
But I'm tired.

286
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:02,422
I'm tired of being someone who wants
to meet others' expectations.

287
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,626
Just let me do what I want!

288
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,429
That's how I feel now.

289
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,132
Okay!

290
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,468
Let's do it!

291
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,338
Do whatever you want.

292
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,407
Don't hold it back.

293
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:27,613
Do what you want to do most now
and don't worry about anything.

We'll let loose our emotions
tonight!

00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,754
Good! Good idea!

296
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,823
This is totally awesome, right?

297
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:41,861
Well, even if we cause any problem
or do anything,

298
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:45,331
Mihane will do something.

299
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,034
Yes, I'll do something.

300
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,169
What do you think?

301
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,240
Well, thanks for cheering me up,
but...

302
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,844
You're on your way home after going
to the amusement park, right?

303
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,086
I wish I could take a ride on
the roller coaster, too.

304
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,489
But I'm a third wheel, right?

305
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,428
You should have just left me alone.

306
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,234
I'm here exactly because
I can't leave you alone.

307
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,549
Okay, we'll start from doing
what Mihane wants first!

308
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,784
On the contrary.

309
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,419
Why?

310
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,054
This is the night that Goro Asakura
lets loose his emotions.

311
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,489
I'll think about it.

312
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,125
- So you'll do it first.
- What?

313
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,095
Then...

314
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,799
(Can the two of us lose ourselves
in love?)

315
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,403
- (I love you, ah...)
- Mihane!

316
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,744
(And my friends plan to run away
from home tonight.)

317
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,983
(Anyway, I don't want to go back
to school or home!)

318
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,924
(Grown-ups tell me to throw away
my heart, but I don't want to.)

319
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,198
Let's sing this, guys!

320
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:28,968
(I ride the motorcycle I stole,)

321
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,638
(without knowing my destination,)

322
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,874

00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,820
- Mr. Miura, is your health okay?
- Yes?

327
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,489
I'm totally fine.

328
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:53,492
The doctor gave me a thorough check
up, and said it was just fatigue.

329
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,294
Don't stress yourself too much.

330
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,699
So...Did you enjoy your date?

331
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,567
We just went to check out the place
for our school trip.

332
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,637
That reminds me!

333
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,340
We saw something strange.

334
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,211
Our students, Mihane Yoshiyama and
Shohei Fukamachi were on their date.

335
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,946
Those kids...

336
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,282
No, that's not what I said
was strange,

337
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:20,486
the two of them suddenly fell a bit,
like this.

338
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,088
They acted like nothing happened

339
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,457
and just kept having
their hamburgers.

340
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,525
Isn't it strange?

341
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,427
They fell a bit?

342
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,862
Yes, like this.

343
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:33,499
They seemed to be used to it
already...

344
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,568
- Cheers. Thanks...
- Thanks...

345
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,569
You don't need a glass?

346
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,371
No, or I'll have to do
more washing-up.

347
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:40,840
Mihane is staying at Ojo's home.

348
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,076
What? But she will sit for her
university entrance exam...

349
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:50,950
Okay...

350
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,255
Here we are.

351
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,391
Okay...

352
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,360
Let's jump!

353
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,965
Oh, my god!

354
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:10,636
I've always wanted to sneak into a
swimming pool at night!

355
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,505
It's awesome to have it to
ourselves!

356
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,874
I'm so jealous! Guys can swim
in their pants!

357
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,008
Jump in, too, Mihane!

358
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,243
Good, Mihane...

359
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,712
- Wait, I'm a girl.
- What?

360
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:20,913
- I'm a girl.
- What?

361
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,582
- You're a girl?
- Yes, I am!

362
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,986
On your mark...

363
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,089
If I win...

364
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,359
Ready...

365
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,363
- break up...
- I won't lose this.

366
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,531
Go!

367
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,074
You can do it...

368
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,649
- Oh?
- Where are my panties?

369
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,620
Shohei is disqualified!

370
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,221
I'm sorry.

371
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,957
- They really are off?
- Yeah, really. Sorry.

372
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,860
Hey, no! Seriously,
you're doing this?

373
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,595
No, seriously...

374
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,430
No! Hey!

375
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,132
Altair.

376
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,067
Vega.

377
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,836
Deneb.

378
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,006
The Summer Triangle.

379
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,743
The Milky Way is stunning.

380
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,913
The light of the stars

381
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,950
is the light they gave out
a long, long time ago,

382
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,053
and it finally reaches the Earth...
What...what are you...

383
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,788
What are you doing? Hang on...

384
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,456
One, two...

385
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,363
That was a new record!

386
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,170
Oh, my god!

387
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,173
Mihane, this...Shohei suggested
doing this.

388
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,008
Don't be ridiculous!
No, it was Goro!

389
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,277
Well, we can just turn back time.

390
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,883
It's Goro's turn next.

391
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,286
Have you decided what you want
to do?

392
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,289
I want to do something bad.

393
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:15,027
But sneaking into a swimming pool
at night

394
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:19,098
is something that a well-behaved
child shouldn't do, too.

395
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,499
Got it?

396
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:26,906
I want to do...

397
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:29,542
...something bad.

398
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,285
Okay.

399
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,173
Okay, you can break all the windows.

400
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,877
We only have to turn back time.

401
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,209
It's pointless...

402
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,546
...doing this.

403
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,288
I know what I want to do now.

404
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,358
What is it?

405
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,834
I want to stay in today
for the rest of my life.

406
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,411
We'll keep repeating today.
What do you think?

407
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,879
Isn't it fantastic?

408
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,421
I hope tomorrow will never come.

409
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,494
I don't want it to come.

410
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,404
When people don't expect anything
from me,

411
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,806
I can do whatever I please.

412
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,208
That's what I think.

413
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,946
That's why I have an impulse
to do some bad deeds.

414
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,650
But in the end, I'm not brave enough
to do any bad deed.

415
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,454
Becoming the good boy that
everybody wants

416
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,723
is really boring.

417
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,358
You mean becoming a doctor?

418
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,492
That's what my parents want.

419
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,830
If you don't want to be a doctor,
then don't be one.

420
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:09,735
You don't exactly don't want
to be a doctor, do you?

421
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,704
It's difficult, isn't it?

422
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,242
Yes, it is.

423
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,546
You know...

424
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:24,450
I have always wanted to be
a barber, right?

425
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,086
You wanted to be a pair of scissors
at first, though.

426
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,387
What? An object?

427
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,588
It was when I was in kindergarten.

428
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,491
But still! A pair of scissors?
That's too weird.

429
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,193
He was a dangerous boy.

430
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,361
Yes, indeed.

431
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,164
But recently...

432
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,702
I don't know whether my dream

433
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,339
really is becoming a barber or not.

434
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,279
I've been telling my friends and
parents that it was my dream.

435
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,217
I can't help but feel that I can't
throw it away irresponsibly.

436
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,924
Baseball club's Shigemi

437
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,429
has been playing baseball since
Year 1 to Year 12,

438
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,700
but he told me that he didn't know
whether he liked it or not now.

439
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,736
Wow...

440
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,071
And...

441
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,708
I really understand how he felt.

442
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,679
How he felt?

443
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,317
I can do it with all my might,
regardless of if I like it or not.

444
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:34,286
Both Shigemi and I can.

445
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,491
So if I'm not obsessed with it,
I can't really be persistent, too.

446
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,963
In this era,

447
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,334
it must be hard for you because you
can do everything freely.

448
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,670
You have to find out by yourself

449
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:56,175
what role you should play among
so many possibilities, after all.

450
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,180
You're saying it like
it doesn't concern you.

451
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:05,651
People in the future are given
suitable roles in an efficient way.

452
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,288
Wow...

453
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,457
Is it in a movie?

454
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:13,859
Actually,

455
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,363
Goro takes his work seriously,

456
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,832
he's hard-working,

457
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,468
and most importantly,

458
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,003
he is kind to people.

459
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,174
So I think...

460
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,277
you're cut out to be a doctor.

461
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,483
Goro, I think maybe your parents

462
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,119
didn't tell you to be a doctor

463
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,955
just because you got good results in
the mock exam.

464
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:46,325
They've been watching you grow up,

465
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,628
that's why they told you
that you should.

466
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:56,168
Sometimes, people around us know us
better than ourselves...

467
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,537
...surprisingly.

468
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,347
My stupid face was caught
on her camera...

469
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,617
To me,

470
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,954
you look like you're prepared to
face and fight for your own future.

471
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,656
How can you say that?

472
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,630
Actually...

473
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,469
I want to keep taking photos
in college, too.

474
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,176
So I'm going to Tokyo.

475
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,210
What?

476
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,612
Why?

477
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,182
When did you decide that?

478
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,452
Just recently.

479
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,056
I just said it for the first time.

480
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,763
Gosh, it somehow makes me
angry at myself.

481
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,666
Why are you kneeling like that?

482
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,669
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

483
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:14,046
What was tomorrow has become
today again.

484
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,049
We can't stay in "yesterday"
forever.

485
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:23,255
"Tomorrow" keeps becoming "today"
and "today" becomes "yesterday".

486
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,625
Then we will all die someday.

487
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:32,364
We won't be here 100 years later!

488
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,006
Can I do just one evil deed?

489
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,207
What?

490
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,111
Anyway, I'm doing it!

491
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,453
I was in love with Mihane, too!

492
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,027
I have been for my life, but I have
never been able to say it.

493
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:07,266
Then Shohei stole her away right
under my nose and I was so angry!

494
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,669
I am really jealous!

495
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,473
Shohei!

496
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:17,409
Promise me you'll make Mihane happy!

497
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,244
Got it?

498
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,617
I've made up my mind.

499
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,722
I won't return to the 22nd Century.

500
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,360
I will make Mihane happy!

501
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,997
I will, with all my might!

502
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,266
Idiot.

503
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,836
Thank you, Goro!

504
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:49,074
Don't thank me!

505
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,112
(When I look at the sun through
my palm,)

506
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,785
(I see my red, flowing blood.)

507
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:08,527
(The earthworms, the mole crickets,)

508
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,030
(and the pond skaters...)

509
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,832
(...are all alive,)

510
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:19,538
(all of them are friends.)

511
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,673
Idiot!

512
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,344
- Is it set?
- Yeah.

513
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,279
- Is this okay?
- How many seconds?

514
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,781
Six, five, four, three, two, one...

515
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,413
Where have you been?

516
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,753
If you want to succeed the shop
no matter what...

517
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,323
Do whatever you please.

518
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,763
I won't be a barber.

519
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,498
What?

520
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:22,968
I won't be a barber.

521
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,409
I will study for my
university entrance exam.

522
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,845
And...

523
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,915
I'll face the reality
and see what I'm capable of doing.

524
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:51,296
You must be starving now.
There is natto.

525
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,915
Oh, right...We turned back time.

526
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:16,054
I forgot about the dinner party.
Oh, no...

527
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:23,762
I am sorry.

528
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:30,836
You took so much effort to make
the dishes here,

529
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:32,838
but I...

530
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,742
I just happened to forgot it...

531
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:43,348
Oh, this is the dish you made by
wrapping pork around piece of apple?

532
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,484
It was really delicious!

533
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,920
I'm sorry, it might seem that
I didn't have it,

534
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,090
but I actually did.

535
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:56,328
Mom?

536
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,600
Do you know how much
I've been worrying about you?

537
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,672
I really...

538
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,609
...don't want to be left alone
again.

539
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:17,048
Don't just disappear
without saying anything!

540
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,385
I'm not going anywhere.

541
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,996
"Sample collection point.
Blood sample, urine sample"

542
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,739
I hate the smell of hospital so much
that I could get ill.

543
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,674
The results of your check-up...

544
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:50,282
Frankly, it is really bad.
Your illness is pretty serious.

545
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,385
It can't be that bad.

546
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,554
Only your irregular lifestyle
wouldn't have

547
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,622
harmed your internal
organs to that extend.

548
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,292
The aging of your bones
is significant, too.

549
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,995
Do you have any clues
what might have caused this?

550
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,198
Any clues?

551
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,035
"I am from the future."

552
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,505
Of course I can't tell anyone that.

553
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,174
Pork and egg, and a mixed
Okonomiyaki. 1900 yen, please.

554
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,743
The reason that I'm staying
in the 21st Century...

555
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,712
Keita, no, you can't have beer.

556
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,415
Hey! Don't go! You haven't paid!

557
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,817
There is only one reason.
It's because...

558
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:26,651
Stop there!

559
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,320
...my family, Yuri and Keita,
are here.

560
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:31,256
Yuri and I didn't get married,

561
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,158
and I'm not related to Keita
by blood.

562
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,528
But still, to me,

563
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,497
they are still the precious family
that is irreplaceable.

564
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,833
You got in my way...

565
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:45,070
Pay me 1900 yen! Or I'm not going to
let you go easily!

566
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,573
He got away and it was your fault!
You idiot!

567
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,611
Our fateful...Well, it's not exactly
the right word. It's been 7 years...

568
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,246
...since we first met each other.

569
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,321
An encounter can change a person.

570
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,298
If someone from the future
keep staying in this era...

571
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,735
...he will die an early death?

572
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,538
I knew this, too, only after I spent
three years in this era.

573
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,342
Break up with Mihane and go back
soon. It's for your own sake.

574
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:28,713
Are you going to keep staying here?

575
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,918
I don't mind dying. My family here
is more important than my life.

576
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,655
If I can be with Yuri and Keita
until my life ends,

577
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:37,956
then I'll be happy.

578
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:50,835
But is it okay that I'm the only one
who is happy?

579
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,671
What?

580
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:56,841
Hey.

581
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,111
Mihane can leap through time, right?

582
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,886
You got it right.

583
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,596
I have to tell you about
Ribon's Mr. Miura.

584
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,131
What happened to Mr. Miura?

585
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:22,667
He might come and talk to you
about something weird,

586
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,636
but don't believe anything he says.

587
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,739
Everything he says is a lie.

588
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,741
What?

589
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,043
He is trying to break us up.

590
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:36,448
- What?
- Anyway.

591
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,817
Just trust me.

592
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,490
I want to be with you
no matter what.

593
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:47,959
I mean...

594
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:49,995
I will.

595
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,174
I was wondering what you've been
doing, skipping the extra lessons.

596
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:05,243
You're suddenly eager.

597
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,013
- Zoe.
- Yes?

598
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,782
You have to return to the 22nd
Century as soon as possible.

599
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:12,050
I do want to.

600
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,752
The self-cleansing action of space
and time

601
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,754
is trying to expel
all alien objects.

602
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:19,257
- Pardon?
- We are from the future,

603
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,527
and time flows quicker for us.

604
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,764
Well...What does that mean?

605
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,807
If someone from the future
continue to stay in this era,

606
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,676
they will die an early death.

607
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,013
What?

608
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,152
What...

609
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,757
What?

610
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,626
Die an early death?

611
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,494
Die an early death...

612
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:07,338
Are you not...going back with me?

613
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:15,180
The lab after school...
Please! Let me go back!

614
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,414
It's hypnotization.

615
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:19,918
Goro was the one who saved my life
at that time...

616
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:21,619
But I want to be here with you.

617
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:22,987
You have to go back!

618
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,590
Please do a time-leap
and make our family disappear!

619
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,559
But I think you should be
responsible for your encounter.

620
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,961
I have been very happy
in the few years with you.

621
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,963
I actually don't have a son.

622
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,966
I have made up my mind. Does this
really trouble you?

623
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,535
I don't want your life get cut
short, Shohei.

624
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:40,238
Of course I want to be with you
forever!

625
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,639
Farewell.

626
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,375
But don't run away from your family.

627
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,744
Thank you for all your
fantastic dishes.

628
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,847
Please take care of my mom forever.

629
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,582
What is a "right goodbye"?

630
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,117
If you've realized your mistake,

631
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,651
then don't make it again.

632
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:56,721
I'm here to help you go back
to the 22nd Century.
