"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time
Final Episode"

2
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,315
What is this?

3
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,818
The smell...

4
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,835
I don't like to say goodbye.

5
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,003
I hate it.

6
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,876
So much that I bawled when we had a
class shuffle two years ago.

7
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,913
When I have to say goodbye
to my friends,

8
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,184
or when I have to say goodbye to a
time I treasure, I'd feel lonely.

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,355
I think of time as my life.

10
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,861
Hey...

11
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,097
Will you cry?

12
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,737
Will you cry if our time dies?

13
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,207
Keita,

14
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,210
are you going to keep loving
your mom?

15
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,913
Of course I am!

16
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,350
You'll listen to her, and talk to
her about interesting things?

17
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,952
Of course I will!

18
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,024
Thank you!

19
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,864
Mi-kun, too, please continue
to take care of mom.

20
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,699
Sure. Cheers.

21
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,403
I have to keep making you like me,
too.

22
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,404
What?

23
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:56,410
You know, my father hated me,
so he left us.

24
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,781
- No, that's not true.
- It is true.

25
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,183
I remember it.

26
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,624
"7 years ago"

27
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,293
Hey, stop there!

28
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,361
Pay for the food!

29
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:25,272
He got away and it's all your fault!
You idiot!

30
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:38,018
Actually...Why did you cry?

31
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,788
It has nothing to do with you.

32
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,223
Has nothing to do with you!

33
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,200
Who the heck are you?

34
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,813
She has paid off her debt,
hasn't she?

35
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,583
Wait...What are we here for?

36
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,252
Well...She has paid off her debt.

37
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,222
Bon appetit...

38
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,825
Miura...

39
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,994
What about "Mi-kun"?

40
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,199
Mi-kun.

41
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,535
Well done!

42
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:32,406
Seven years have passed since then,
and Keita has grown up a lot.

43
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,542
It's been seven years, huh?

44
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,847
My body aged many times
quicker than that,

45
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,949
and it's seriously damaged.

46
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,518
When the doctor told us
the results of your checkup...

47
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,788
I think it was my fault.

48
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,557
That's not the case at all.

49
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,294
I think maybe the food I make
isn't healthy enough.

50
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:59,166
You aged so much that there is
no medical explanation...

51
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,335
I just don't get it.

52
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,240
Sometimes I'm worried...

53
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,577
...that when I wake up in
the morning,

54
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,314
and I will find that you're gone.

55
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,688
So when I wake up and see you here,

56
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,357
I feel like I had
a fateful encounter.

57
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,695
When you meet someone, you only feel
the delight for a brief moment,

58
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,331
but I feel that every single day.

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,903
How blessed I am!

60
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,140
On that night,

61
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,744
I kept thinking about what is the
right way to say goodbye.

62
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,847
Wheat noodles...

63
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,918
- Oh!
- It's hot, isn't it?

64
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,152
I'll drive you home.

65
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,621
No, thanks. I haven't been
exercising enough.

66
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,725
I would like to ask you a favor.

67
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,027
What?

68
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,366
I come from the 22nd Century.

69
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,202
Yes?

70
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,205
To collect samples of
the environment here.

71
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,575
But then, I met Yuri.

72
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,112
So I decided to stay in this era
and form a family.

73
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,282
But after a few years,
I felt a change in my body.

74
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,853
When I had my cells checked,

75
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,555
they showed signs of rapid aging.

76
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:33,293
It is a self-cleansing action caused
by time energy.

77
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,231
Time flows faster for people
from the future.

78
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,733
I cannot live long.

79
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,208
You're seeing Shohei, aren't you?

80
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,944
You should break up with him
as soon as possible.

81
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,248
Shohei is from the future, too.

82
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,655
Wow...Is he?

83
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,124
Anyway, the introduction was
too long.

84
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,526
It'd be more simple and interesting

85
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,195
if you tell me that we're siblings
related by blood,

86
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,030
like they do in the lunch time
soap opera.

87
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:11,565
What?

88
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,602
You want to ask me
to break up with Shohei, right?

89
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,439
No, that's not the favor
I want to ask.

90
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,777
Please make my family gone.

91
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,479
What?

92
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,949
I mean, please do a time-leap
and make my family gone.

93
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,919
Make your family gone?

94
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,353
What do you mean?

95
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,491
Please don't let me meet Yuri
seven years ago.

96
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,708
What...No, I can't take this!

97
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,643
This is not for you.

98
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,245
What?

99
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,515
If you pay off her debt with the
money, then we wouldn't have met.

100
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,351
Yuri is gorgeous,

101
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,120
so she would meet someone
and live happily forever.

102
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,690
I'm sure that she'd be happier
like that.

103
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,826
Please, help me.

104
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,228
No way!

105
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,730
And I didn't say I can
leap through time.

106
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,399
No need to feign innocence.
You can, can't you?

107
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,870
When you leap through time,
you jump a bit, like this, right?

108
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,607
Wow...Jump a bit...Is that so?

109
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,942
Be careful,
or you'll hurt your back.

110
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,348
I said, I cannot leap through time.

111
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,253
Mihane!

112
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,021
Please!

113
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,060
Is it okay to just conclude what
Mr. Miura said was a lie?

114
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,363
- He's a pathological liar.
- Yeah, I guess.

115
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,098
But...

116
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,500
He knows that I jump a bit
when I do a time-leap.

117
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,371
- He is a pathological liar.
- You're absolutely correct.

118
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,244
Of course Shohei can't come
from the future.

119
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,445
I told you...

120
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,147
Where are you from, then?

121
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,749
Let's pretend that I'm a foreigner.

122
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,783
Yoshiyama.

123
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,055
I don't think you know me, but...

124
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,057
Yes, I do...

125
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,326
Onishi.

126
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,064
I've decided to transfer to
a school in Tokyo.

127
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,332
What?

128
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,701
I actually wanted...

129
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,570
...to be friends with you.

130
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,545
Please let me take photos of you
someday.

131
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,290
Eight, nine, ten.

132
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,347
The photos are ready.

133
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,481
Thank you.

134
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,852
Oh, wow. I look handsome
in the photos you took.

135
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,324
I don't get why you lied to me.

136
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,892
The reason I lied?

137
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,628
There isn't any,
because it wasn't a lie.

138
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,900
My body can't hold out for long.

139
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,438
I'll have my last supper with them
later.

140
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,975
The two of them don't know this.

141
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,144
It will be our usual supper.

142
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,447
I'll be gone after they fall asleep.

143
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,018
You're running away.

144
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,755
I think you should take the
responsibility of your encounter.

145
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,223
The responsibility of our encounter?

146
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,127
- You should say goodbye properly.
- I won't.

147
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,361
I can't.

148
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,865
I, Yuri and Keita will not be able
to stand the pain of saying goodbye.

149
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,602
Because we're very close.

150
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,904
Then you should stay...

151
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,273
The best way is to avoid
meeting them at all!

152
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,277
You can leap through time, right?

153
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,146
I know.

154
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,947
Please help me!

155
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,183
I love my family.

156
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,820
I don't want them to be sad
because of the problem I have.

157
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,855
I want them to smile.

158
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,559
Please!

159
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,663
To me, my family is more important
than my own life.

160
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,899
Please make our encounter
never happen!

161
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:46,273
I can't really control when I leap
to recently.

162
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,946
I don't know whether I can
go back to 7 years ago smoothly.

163
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,082
You will help me?

164
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,788
But please don't run away from
your family.

165
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,726
Thank you!

166
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,903
- Supper is ready!
- Thank you!

167
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,538
- It looks delicious!
- There you go, Keita.

168
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,773
Thank you.

169
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,109
Thank you.

170
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,779
It's gorgeous!

171
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,684
What's wrong?

172
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,556
I have to tell you something.

173
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,697
This is the last day
that we are a family.

174
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,865
What?

175
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,267
The last day?

176
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,737
The seven years that we've been
a family will be gone.

177
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,373
Don't worry.

178
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,145
We're only going to spend the
seven years again separately.

179
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,713
I said separately,

180
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,917
but we won't feel lonely or sad
because we can't see each other.

181
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,487
Because we wouldn't have met
to begin with.

182
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,824
You mean because you'll stay in
hospital next week?

183
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,193
But the doctor said that it will be
a simple checkup.

184
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,528
Don't make a fuss.

185
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,229
What I want you to understand,

186
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,732
is that...

187
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,003
I love you both from the bottom of
my heart, Yuri and Keita.

188
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,105
I love you very much.

189
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,744
If possible, I wish I could spend my
whole life with you two.

190
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,779
But if I do that,

191
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,315
I am going to make you sad.

192
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,651
I'm going to break your hearts.

193
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,020
So please, understand that.

194
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:45,492
Keita, do give your mom
the support she needs.

195
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,696
No matter what happens,

196
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,066
you should live your life
with all your might.

197
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,368
And...

198
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,973
Find the person that you care for.

199
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,080
Living is to love the people
you care for.

200
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,083
This is what I learnt from you two.

201
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,954
You're just going to have
an endoscopic examination,

202
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,823
don't say it like you're leaving us
forever.

203
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,962
Thank you so much for being my
family in these seven years!

204
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,600
We have been a real family.

205
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,202
I was very happy.

206
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,272
What are you talking about?

207
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,979
We are a family,
and we always will be, right?

208
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,482
We're a family forever.

209
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,657
Mi-kun is crying.
You look so stupid.

210
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,528
- Don't cry, dad.
- What...

211
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,529
Okay.

212
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,233
You are my dad.

213
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,335
You're one of our family.

214
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,241
Keita...

215
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,847
That reminds me.

216
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,583
Look at this...

217
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,285
We took them the other day.

218
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,222
We all look so happy.

219
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,124
We're the greatest family in Japan.

220
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,526
No, in the world.

221
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,561
In the universe!

222
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,666
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

223
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,535
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

224
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,578
It was a sad last supper.

225
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,848
If we had never met,
then all the sadness will be gone.

226
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,021
I wonder if this is the right way
to say goodbye.

227
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,329
It's your own turn next.

228
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:03,797
What?

229
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,865
How are you going to
say goodbye to Shohei?

230
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,071
I'm not going to say goodbye to him.

231
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,140
People from the future
can't live long here.

232
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,711
I told you, I grew up with Shohei.

233
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,212
He hypnotized you.

234
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:21,815
Hypnotized me?

235
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,485
Do you remember what Shohei looked
like when he was a child?

236
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,029
Go away! Go!

237
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,230
Hey! Go away!

238
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,232
Are you okay, Mihane?

239
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,036
Mihane, it's okay now.

240
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,149
It was Goro...

241
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:02,055
It was Goro who saved my life
at that time.

242
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,228
It wasn't Shohei...

243
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:24,944
"Okonomiyaki Ribon"

244
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,780
(Your life is short,)

245
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,186
(so go and fall in love, maiden.)

246
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,462
Oh? Where is Goro today?
What is he doing?

247
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,431
I think he has gone to
his cram school.

248
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,000
Seven years later, you told me to
give this to you.

249
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,740
Stop there!

250
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,410
Hey...Stop!

251
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,013
I don't want it.

252
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,570
- Welcome.
- Hello.

253
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,405
- Welcome!
- Hello.

254
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,310
There is something that
we would like to tell you today.

255
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,780
- We're getting married.
- What?

256
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,348
We hope you two would be
our witnesses.

257
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,484
- Wow!
- Congratulations!

258
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,953
Thanks. We have to thank
the two of you for this.

259
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,223
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, we scared you.

260
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,459
- Good job, Mr. Yano!
- Don't tell anyone yet.

261
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,861
- But...
- Choose what you say.

262
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,996
We'll do what we should do.

263
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,376
Hey, wait for me.

264
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,154
You...

265
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,124
Who the heck are you?

266
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:19,959
What?

267
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,363
What do you mean?

268
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,898
You want to hypnotize me again?

269
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,167
Are you going to rewrite my memory?

270
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,643
What? You know?

271
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:37,644
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

272
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,481
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

273
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,418
My real name...

274
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,421
...is Ken Sogol.

275
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,958
In our era, the environment on Earth
is different from now.

276
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,794
It's covered with snow
throughout the year.

277
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,535
There is no season after
the 21st Century.

278
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,940
We've came to study summer.

279
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:12,045
I was supposed to go back after
staying for a few hours,

280
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,316
but I carelessly lost the potion
for doing time-leap.

281
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,084
What?

282
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,186
You lost it?

283
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,921
It was a small bottle...

284
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,458
with a green lid and some purple
liquid in it.

285
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,794
Have you seen it?

286
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,697
- Why would I have?
- True.

287
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,203
- And?
- Oh...And...

288
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,038
If I use the spare potion

289
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,408
to mix with the ingredients I can
get in this era as well,

290
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,914
I should be able to have finished
making the potion, but...

291
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:48,948
But what?

292
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,651
You were too careless again?

293
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,855
You knocked over all the potions.

294
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,527
It was after school on 7th July,

295
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,863
in the lab's storage room.

296
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,666
What?

297
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,372
You mean it was my fault that you
can't go back?

298
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,207
Well, if you put it that way,

299
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,143
then, yes, it was.

300
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,413
But thanks to that,

301
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:25,251
we fell in love, didn't we?

302
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,227
Mihane?

303
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,200
You can't go back now?

304
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,872
I'm making the potion from scratch
again,

305
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,542
and it will be completed soon.

306
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,213
But don't worry,

307
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,584
I'm staying in this era.

308
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,987
What?

309
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,155
What?

310
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,393
I thought you would be happy.

311
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,264
You have to go back!

312
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,267
- If you stay in this era...
- But I want to be with you.

313
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,273
If that Mr. Miura
really cared about his family,

314
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:25,978
he should have stayed in this era
until his last moment.

315
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:29,782
Go back.

316
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,318
But I've made up my mind.

317
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,521
Does it bring you so much trouble?

318
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,961
Just go back!

319
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,864
Go back to the future
as soon as possible.

320
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,746
Come and help me, Mihane.

321
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,017
- Help you with what?
- Put this on the table.

322
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,085
This?

323
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,654
- Yes...
- Okay.

324
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:17,196
- Hey...What are you doing?
- You're so clumsy.

325
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,165
- Step away.
- Gosh!

326
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,900
Why is the newspaper placed here?

327
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,503
Apologize before you blame others!

328
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,539
I'll just turn it back, okay?

329
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:35,648
Oh?

330
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,850
Why?

331
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,958
- What are you doing?
- Why?

332
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:49,228
Why? Turn it back...

333
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:52,198
Turn it back...

334
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,399
Turn it back...

335
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,545
"To you, who never know summer.
A photo collection"

336
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,790
You're going now?

337
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:19,859
What?

338
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,529
Mix the rice like you're cutting it.

339
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,364
Take it.

340
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:31,671
That's it. Well done.

341
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,908
Have you noticed who I actually am?

342
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,645
On the night you didn't come home,

343
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,849
I got so worried that
I went to ask for the police's help.

344
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,689
I didn't have a son.

345
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:13,946
So...

346
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,651
You're not going to ask...

347
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,921
...who I really am?

348
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,692
I enjoyed having you here,

349
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,196
and I know that you aren't
a bad person.

350
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,033
Thank you very much

351
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,036
for all the delicious dishes
you've made me.

352
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,147
When are you leaving?

353
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,584
Tomorrow.

354
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,960
Then please do the washing up
tonight.

355
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,695
As your rent.

356
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,463
Mom!

357
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,944
"Barber Asakura"

358
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:26,953
What's the matter?

359
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,658
There is no reaction...

360
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,493
What?

361
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,934
Seriously?

362
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,572
Oh, my god...

363
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:51,444
I have to grow old and die
in this era!

364
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:53,713
This is amazing...

365
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,449
I can stay in this era!

366
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,351
You darn idiot!

367
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,621
This is awesome! Fantastic!

368
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,022
Yes!

369
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:13,933
Mihane.

370
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,535
Mihane!

371
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,456
Good news.

372
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:43,062
The ingredients in the potion didn't
react in the final stage.

373
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:48,200
What? Say that you're happy.

374
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,103
Be happy for me.

375
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,205
I can't.

376
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,809
You can't live for long.

377
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,814
It's all my fault.

378
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,984
If I hadn't knocked over the lab's
apparatus on that day,

379
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,155
you would've been able to
return to the future.

380
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,860
I wish I hadn't...

381
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,330
What?

382
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:20,699
Pardon?

383
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,639
I said, I wish I hadn't
fallen in love.

384
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,686
You'll get many questions on the
area of quadratic functions

385
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,854
in your exam,

386
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,889
so make sure you do some
revision on them.

387
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,563
Is there any problem
you can't solve?

388
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:55,434
I said something that
I didn't actually mean.

389
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:58,737
And?

390
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,775
The way I said goodbye...

391
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,378
...was wrong.

392
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,682
If you realize you've made
a mistake,

393
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,284
then you'll not make it again.

394
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,315
- Mayuka, let's go.
- Okay.

395
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,820
Could this be...

396
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,724
It has a green lid

397
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,626
and purple liquid inside.

398
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:02,935
Shohei!

399
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,939
Shohei!

400
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,046
He's not here.

401
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,737
I can use it instead.

402
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,857
It's faint, but the smell...

403
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:18,744
I'll go back to the lab afterschool
on 7th July.

404
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,780
Just when I thought that,

405
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,683
I realized something important

406
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,619
and I hesitated.

407
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,155
If I return to that day,

408
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,292
that means my first love with Shohei

409
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,862
would never have happened.

410
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,233
But it's just my first love!

411
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,370
It's the first love
that I'm going to forget anyway.

412
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,473
It's the first love

413
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,809
that I'll just make fun of someday
and have a good laugh.

414
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,813
I don't have to be hesitant.

415
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,984
For the person I care for,

416
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,355
I'll throw away something trivial,
like my first love.

417
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,625
It's just my first love.

418
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,295
But it's still my first love.

419
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:19,338
Please...

420
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,140
Please!

421
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,274
Please...

422
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,146
7th July...

423
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,580
"8th August"

424
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,349
In the lab, after school.

425
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,252
Please! Let me go back!

426
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,123
Please be my Juliet.

427
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,068
Julio!

428
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,625
"7th July"

429
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,608
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

430
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,411
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"

431
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,850
Shohei.

432
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:43,455
You're here, right?

433
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,128
Hey...

434
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:57,703
Hey.

435
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,671
Where are you?

436
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,580
Over there, huh?

437
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,116
What are you doing here?

438
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,327
I'm here to help you return
to the 22nd Century.

439
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,402
The last time...

440
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,874
I knocked over the very same set of
apparatus.

441
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:40,612
And that's why...

442
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,082
you couldn't return to the future.

443
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,521
I inhaled it,

444
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:51,857
then I passed out.

445
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,360
It gave me the ability to
leap through time,

446
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,431
and I had a lot of fun.

447
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,412
So it was the smell of lavender...

448
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,862
You don't know this now,

449
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,399
but we...

450
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,169
We were a couple.

451
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,271
What?

452
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:44,109
It's not right to say that
we were a couple, though.

453
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,312
It should be in the future.

454
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,121
You fell in love with me,

455
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,960
then you rewrote my memories,

456
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,297
so that you could take advantage
of it.

457
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,234
You're awful.

458
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,603
I'm sorry.

459
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,772
Don't apologize!

460
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,042
You still haven't done it.

461
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,614
This is you, when you had
iced pineapple for the first time.

462
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,317
You looked happier than
when we watched the fireworks.

463
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:00,619
But after this...

464
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,890
The decoration of the frame
hit right at you.

465
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,525
Seriously?

466
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,229
But I protected you by
turning back time.

467
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,866
I saved your life,

468
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,871
so I felt relieved and cried.
You saw me...

469
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,274
...and you laughed.

470
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,913
Why are you wearing sweat suit
alone?

471
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,449
15 minutes before this was taken...

472
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,687
You...

473
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,558
...kissed me for the first time.

474
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,530
I tried to run away and fell
into the swimming pool.

475
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,034
Sorry for dodging your kiss.

476
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,907
Our class did a performance
in the Garyosai Festival.

477
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,610
You played Julio.

478
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,445
Julio?

479
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,980
It was Romeo and Julio.

480
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,921
When we had a party afterwards,

481
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,824
you confessed your love for me
in front of everyone.

482
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,794
I'm not good at dealing with
situations like that,

483
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,397
but...

484
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,201
I was happy.

485
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,142
This was taken when we went
on a picnic.

486
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,245
We had a date in an amusement park.

487
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,782
The dinner party at your home.

488
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:38,850
At the swimming pool
in the middle of the night.

489
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,490
Your funny face...

490
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,627
What about it?

491
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,697
It's pretty awful.

492
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,567
Though it's a funny face...

493
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,839
I don't want my boyfriend
to look like this.

494
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,377
It's bad for
people who come from the future

495
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,452
to stay in this era for too long.

496
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,189
To help you go back
to the future,

497
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,726
coming here today is the only way.

498
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,328
But you told me

499
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,264
that you were not going back.

500
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,869
You said you'd rather have your life
cut short than separate with me.

501
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,273
But I don't want that to happen.

502
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,878
I don't want you to have your life
cut short

503
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,880
just to be here with me.

504
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:45,417
So...

505
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:50,655
Go back.

506
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:55,894
I see.

507
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,231
Are you really okay...

508
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,401
...with me returning to the future?

509
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,042
I've been holding back,

510
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,312
but when you ask me that...

511
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,615
I don't want you to go back.

512
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:20,519
Of course I want to be with you
forever.

513
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,356
Because it is my first love.

514
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,959
I really don't want to lose it.

515
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,731
But if I don't get you back
to the future,

516
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,868
you're going to die.

517
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:47,779
So I'll give up.

518
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,349
I see.

519
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,661
Take it.

520
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,665
If you've finished making
your potion,

521
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:08,934
then go back as soon as you can!

522
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,269
Just go!

523
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,526
Hey...This...

524
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,462
"To you, who never knew love"

525
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,297
You wrote this, didn't you?

526
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,413
It's a photo book made
by an unknown photographer.

527
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:30,815
This...

528
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,085
Isn't it yours?

529
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,155
No...

530
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,057
This is...

531
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,360
the photo book that
you are going to make.

532
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,866
"To you, who never knew summer.
A photo collection"

533
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,273
All the photos are great, right?

534
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,944
This is an amazing collection
of photos.

535
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:02,113
I see.

536
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,150
I have to thank you for everything.

537
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:10,689
Thank you.

538
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,059
I'll take...

539
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,294
the summer,

540
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,830
and my love back with me.

541
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:30,942
I love you.

542
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,146
Farewell.

543
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,253
Thank you.

544
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,420
There she is.

545
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:18,823
Mihane?

546
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:35,940
I have to submit the form of
my plan after high school.

547
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:40,745
Your first choice is
the University of Tokyo?

548
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,280
Kyoto University? Harvard?

549
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,449
- Which one?
- Harvard!

550
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,751
Just joking.

551
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,955
It's a university, which I can
do a photography degree course.

552
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:54,859
You're serious?

553
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:55,994
I...

554
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,198
There is something I want to do.

555
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,264
I took it!
