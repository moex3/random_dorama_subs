1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,238
Where is it?

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,009
MINATO-KU SUZURAN-CHO 2 AREA MAP

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,112
Where could it possibly be?

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,882
I believe love is like holding a sword.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,351
It's a battle between a man and a woman.

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,755
Romance is where you learn
how far you can hurt someone.

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,425
Without holding the sword, you don't know
when someone starts to bleed.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,127
You don't know how to heal.

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,129
Wow, that's so deep.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,198
Even so, there's not even a sign

11
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,767
that anything's going on.

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,702
Kids these days aren't interested in love.

13
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,538
Same with my daughter.

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,974
She's never had a boyfriend in her life.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,777
Even with your daughter?

16
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,945
I'm sure she's beautiful and pretty too.

17
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,614
Not as much as me.

18
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,783
-Please edit that out.
-Yes.

19
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,387
<i>THE NEVERENDING LESSON</i>

21

Excuse me?

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,430
Oh, we're not suspicious.
We just had a question.

23
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,397
Okay.

24
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,434
Do you know a building called
Angel Forest Tower?

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,668
Sure.

26
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,372
-Cross here, turn right…
-So it is famous.

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,108
Well, I live there.

28
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,044
<i>I had her quite young. She's already 20.</i>

29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,815
I want my daughter to experience love.

30
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,052
There are parts of you that can only grow
through romance.

31
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,323
Most of all, don't you think it's sad to
not know the feeling of being in love

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,358
after being born in this world?

33
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>THE SOUND OF DREAMS</i>

34
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,095
You want and pursue someone,

35
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,863
you get hurt, you hurt them,

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,498
and you learn what it is to be human.

37
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,434
Those without that experience are weak.

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,406
Are you listening, Ms. Matsuyama?

39
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,978
Sorry, don't shoot from below.

40
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,080
The upper right is my best angle.

41
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,014
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,052
<i>You don't know her?</i>

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,788
Aoi Minase, the queen of romance novels.

44
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,757
I guess kids these days don't know her.

45
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:09,262
Like the <i>Sound of Dreams</i> or
<i>Seeing You Tomorrow.</i>

46
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,731
It took the world by storm back then.

47
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,399
How about now?

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,769
-Well, it's hard to say…
-Past its prime?

49
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,872
You're a straight talker!

50
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,974
You said turn right here…

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,709
I'm going to the convenience store.

52
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,678
I didn't think I'd be concerned
about this.

53
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,581
Ever since my daughter was young,
my concern was

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,884
what if she gets caught up
with the wrong guy?

55
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,687
But there hasn't been a single guy
pursuing her.

56
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,190
Now, I have the opposite concern.

57
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,325
What if she never gets a boyfriend, and…

58
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,394
Even though her mother's a
master of romance?

59
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,562
A master? Me?

60
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,132
You've written so many romance novels.

61
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,101
You must have so much experience,

62
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,203
and have been pursued by many men.

63
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,572
No, it's not like that.

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,077
<i>Ms. Matsuyama is</i>

65
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,781
<i>my mother's editor of 20 years.</i>

66
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,449
<i>But because of the recession,</i>

67
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,885
<i>Saneisha asked for employees to</i>
<i>retire early,</i>

68
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,953
<i>and she volunteered.</i>

69
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>Today is her last day.</i>

70
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,193
It's been so long, Editor-in-Chief!

71
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,229
I'm sorry it's been so long, star writer!

72
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,198
As expected of
the queen of romance novels.

73
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,266
What a beautiful home you have.

74
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,235
What's wrong?

75
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,571
Is that a bean jelly from Tatsuya?

76
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,705
Oh, you don't like these?

77
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,808
I do, but that's an apology gift.

78
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,413
So observant… Don't worry about me.
Please continue your interview.

79
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,248
We'll talk later.

80
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,584
Ms. Minase, you say that,
but I'm sure you'd get

81
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,620
very lonely once your daughter
has a boyfriend.

82
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,656
No, I'm more worried about her
staying home and becoming

83
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,592
"a parasite single."

84
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,327
Do you know about those?

85
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,629
Yes, it's kids who don't marry
and stay home…

86
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,599
Exactly! What if she's still living here
when she turns 30, 40,

87
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,867
or even 50?

88
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,704
Without a boyfriend, without marrying…
How horrific!

89
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,106
But your marriage didn't last, either.

90
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,374
What did you say?

91
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,575
I'm home.

92
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,683
Welcome home. Say hello to everyone.

93
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,688
Welcome to Denny's.

94
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,691
That was otterly weird. Get otter here!

95
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,693
THIS IS A SMALL-CLAWED OTTER!

96
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,465
Oh? You're the girl from earlier.

97
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,033
He said you're past your prime.

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,134
No, that was you…

99
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,003
Welcome home, Sora.

100
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,971
Where were you today?

101
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,173
Your daughter was buying
pornographic comics

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,143
at Tokyo Big Sight.

103
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,145
A ton of them.

104
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,954

00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,897
Another bite! Eat another bite!

<i>This is Gon-chan's dad, Shunichiro.</i>

-Excuse me?
-Yes, sir!

<i>Odaya, struggling from the</i>

<i>That was the sanmayaki,</i>
<i>instead of the taiyaki.</i>

125
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,613
Welcome, everyone!
We have some delicious taiyaki!

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,716
We have whole beans, crushed beans,

127
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,618
Indian beans, alien beans… Just kidding!

128
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,953
We have everything!

129
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,890
-Right?
-I know!

130
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,560
You're not eating that?

131
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,695
Our bean paste is really good!

132
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,032
Yes, of course it's good,
but there's just too much.

133
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,734
What?

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,869
<i>That was a big shock to Gon-chan.</i>

135
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,006
<i>In his life, he never doubted the</i>
<i>universal good of stuffing taiyaki</i>

136
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,476
<i>with as much bean paste as possible,</i>
<i>to the tail.</i>

137
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,614
<i>With this experience, he invented</i>
<i>the sanmayaki, with less bean paste.</i>

138
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,419
So this is the sanmayaki?

139
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,187
I'm not a fan of too much bean paste.

140
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,623
That's why Odaya made this for me.

141
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,826
-She's lying.
-If there's only a little bit of paste,

142
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,995
it looks like fish organs. Gross!

143
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,199
So they're testing a new recipe
with white bean paste. Right, Sora?

144
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,100
Roger that.

145
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,602
That's not how you use that word.

146
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,604
Can I eat some, too?

147
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,272
Roger that.

148
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,614
I'm sorry this is more bean paste, but…
Here you are.

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,983
Hey, Sora's right there!

150
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,118
Tatsuya's bean jelly,
kneaded with apologies.

151
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,354
The weight of the jelly represents
the guilt.

152
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,257
Red bean paste,
stewed and simmered apologies.

153
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,191
What are you saying?

154
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
I'm so scared!
What will he apologize to me about?

155
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,198
This is difficult for me to say…

156
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,933
Then don't say it!

157
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,745
Oh, sorry! I need to take this.

158
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,914
Hey, wassup?

159
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,751
You're in Nishiazabu? Sure.
Right now? Yeah, sure.

160
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,789
Yes. Ask them to open early.
You're a VIP, they'd do that!

161
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,591
And who are you?

162
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,862
Everything is so chaotic, I haven't
had the chance to introduce…

163
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,298
Not yet. Now's not the time.

164
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,534
Alright, got it!
I'll just deal with this quickly.

165
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,970
I'll be right over. Okay!

166
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,308
Oh, sorry about that.

167
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,443
Apologies, apologies.

168
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,745
You know, you might call me

169
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,581
a little outdated, but…

170
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,750
Ms. Aoi. I'm so sorry about this.

171
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,620
Wait, don't say it! Sora's here!

172
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,055
Hey, don't you have work?

173
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,156
After I eat this.

174
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,126
Your series at Raphael
will end next month.

175
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,261
Canceled.

176
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
No!

177
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,267
We're so sorry.

178
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,773
I guess I'm too out of touch
for this line of work…

179
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,609
Huh?

180
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,211
The series at Raphael is
<i>Umbilical Cord,</i> right?

181
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,581
You said we'd release season two,
serialize it, and make a movie…

182
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,386
See! It says Season One right here!

183
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,388
Season One is the end.

184
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,956
What the hell?

185
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,993
Well… This book…

186
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,396
It didn't sell. It really didn't sell.

187
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,564
Not at all.

188
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,366
Soften it.

189
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,402
Soften the blow! You're too frank!

190
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,038
We need a little frankness at times,
don't you think?

191
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,275
This proves Aoi Minase is
a romance writer after all.

192
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,609
Mystery wasn't your thing.

193
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,078
I used all my weak brain powers
to write this!

194
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,314
Season One didn't sell at all,

195
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,317
so the film company had second thoughts,

196
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,288
we couldn't find actors or directors.
Truly, no one.

197
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,959
So who will it be?

198
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,527
Huh?

199
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,896
Who's going to take over
my spot at Raphael?

200
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,435
We found someone really good!

201
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,469
Who?

202
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,939
The handsome TV star, Tomoro Nakagawa.

203
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,141
-You know him too, right, Sora?
-No.

204
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,677
She's an otaku. Only interested in 2D men.
She doesn't even know

205
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,445
how many members are in Arashi.

206
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,413
There are five.

207
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,747
So close! There are six!

208
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,549
Ms. Aoi, there are five.

209
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,220
Anyways, Tomoro Nakagawa is
the next Arashi.

210
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,122
He's also the one who just called me.

211
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,859
He said he had an idea for a new series.
He's in Nishiazabu…

212
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,595
-Wait.
-He's drinking at a bar.

213
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,196
-Wait!
-It sure is nice to be young.

214
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,565
"Wait, will you?" That's a Kimutaku quote.

215
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,866
Wait.

216
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,469
He's an actor, right? An actor!
This Nakagawa man.

217
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,672
Yes, he became popular in the
morning drama series "Glaring Sun".

218
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,109
An actor should act! He's just hot, right?

219
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,712
He probably can't write a sentence
to save his life!

220
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,180
Ms. Aoi.

221
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,681
The thing is…

222
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,684
He's a pretty good writer.

223
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,320
And he has fans,

224
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,322
so we can expect sales.

225
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,428
Alright then. I'll be off…

226
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,731
Oh, I almost forgot.

227
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,967
I totally forgot he was here.

228
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,638
Since Matsuyama will be retiring early,

229
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,707
he will be your editor from now on.

230
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,843
I'm Tachibana.

231
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,780
"Soseki Tachibana"?

232
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,782
Your name is Soseki?

233
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,885
Yes. My brother is "Ogai."

234
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,589
-You're kidding!
-No, it's true.

235
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,190
His father loves literature.

236
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,293
He's just a high school teacher, though.

237
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,928
You don't need to say "just."

238
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,764
You could get in trouble for that.

239
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,932
So you're my new editor?

240
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,971
Yes. No matter how hard I work,
a woman would never be promoted.

241
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:16,108
Instead of being bossed around
by stupid young men,

242
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,978
I'll be retiring early and start work
at an IKEA near me.

243
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,513
I'll be the manager there.

244
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,381
That was so much information.

245
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,417
But you know, Ms. Minase,

246
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,585
we really care about you.

247
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,388
That's why we got the hottest guy
to be your editor.

248
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,289
"Hot?"

249
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,126
You just have hair in your eyes.

250
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,998
These days, all young hot guys have
hair in their eyes, so I can't tell.

251
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,299
Like that famous guy…

252
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,501
Stop! That's a red card!

253
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,136
This is broadcast TV, not Hulu.

254
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,339
I think he's pretty hot.

255
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,843
Maybe you can tell once he's next to me.

256
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,516
Hey, cameraman? Don't come too close.
Pull back.

257
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,819
He's eight heads tall.
I'm four heads tall.

258
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,422
Konishi-kun, you've gotten fat!

259
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,259
<i>Mom calls the editor-in-chief</i>
<i>"Konishi-kun"</i>

260
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,495
<i>because they're old friends.</i>

261
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:14,333
<i>I don't know the details, but apparently,</i>
<i>he was the one that discovered my mom.</i>

262
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,885
<i>Even after losing a job,</i>
<i>the sky is wide and beautiful.</i>

263
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,688
TAIYAKI

264
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,922
-Come again!
-Thank you!

265
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,390
Thank you!

266
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,464
Did I mess up?

267
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:50,703
No one's buying the sanmayaki!
Maybe it's the design.

268
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,872
I already got ten molds made too.

269
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,140
It'll pick up.

270
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,841
You think?

271
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:57,943
Let's hope so…

272
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,149
The customers are gone, so
let's take a break when you're done.

273
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,183
-Yes, sir!
-Sure.

274
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,123
I think we should move.

275
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,895
I don't think we can pay the mortgage.

276
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,100
Is your mom struggling

277
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,902
that much for work?

278
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,837
She might start wanting to work here.

279
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,706
No way. We can't hire Aoi!

280
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,809
She's no good! She can't do anything!

281
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,478
She'd break all the plates.
She's so clumsy!

282
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,914
What? A love story?

283
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,148
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,952
I'm writing romance again?

285
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,956
You're Aoi Minase,
the queen of romance novels, after all.

286
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,725
But that wasn't going so well. That's why

287
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,460
I wrote mystery…

288
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,897
But that was even worse.

289
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,168
So if I write romance,
you'll publish the book for sure?

290
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,904
Yes. Saneisha will make sure that happens.

291
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,141
I think there are a lot of fans
awaiting your romance novel.

292
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,346
I can't any more.

293
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,218
I'm so far from romance…

294
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,857
I don't have anyone to do it with.

295
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,933
Come.

296
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,682
Ow…

297
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,619
I avoided the tender spots.

298
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,425
Thank you very much!

299
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,760
Aoi.

300
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,798
If you eat that fast,
you're going to choke.

301
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,434
Shunichiro…

302
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,572
Can you hire me for 5,000 yen an hour?

303
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,274
Even 50 yen an hour is too much.

304
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,747
Hey, Dad?

305
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,416
For Nagaiki Home across the street,

306
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,952
did they say they want
40 taiyaki for dessert…

307
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,187
-Ouch!
-What the hell?

308
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,658
-You were here?
-My eyes! I'm going blind!

309
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,527
You can't see my handsome face.

310
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,164
I'm off to deliver ten taiyaki
to Hana Café.

311
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,265
Good work!

312
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,167
Good work! Ow…

313
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,101
What's wrong?

314
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,870
Recently, I can't raise my right arm.

315
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,341
You've got frozen shoulder! You're so old!

316
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,011
Sora, you can clock out
when you're done with that delivery.

317
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,081
Okay! Oh, but my bike…

318
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,583
-Mom, can you take my bike home?
-Okay!

319
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,087
-What do you want to eat tonight?
-Um… Grilled meat?

320
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,088
Then Hamada?

321
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,223
Hamada! Good idea!

322
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,658
But the leftover curry…

323
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,894
I'll go home and freeze it.

324
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,763
Got it.
Don't forget to remove the potatoes.

325
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,303
Her bike saddle is too high for me.

326
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,572
I have to lower it. So much work.

327
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,707
You've got short legs.

328
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,644
Gon-chan. Can you lower the saddle?

329
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,879
What?

330
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,182
Alright!

331
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,719
TAIYAKI

332
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,190
This is rusty! You have to maintain it!

333
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,124
Okay.

334
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:37,229
<i>Gon-chan and Mom are old childhood friends</i>
<i>who grew up together in Suzuran District.</i>

335
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,999
<i>A lot of things happened,</i>
<i>and they're both single.</i>

336
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:45,170
<i>Gon-chan is a bit older, but they both</i>
<i>went to the same calligraphy class.</i>

337
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,441
A HOPEFUL SPRING

338
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,578
<i>That was Gon-chan's greatest masterpiece.</i>

339
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,648
<i>The teacher was approaching.</i>
<i>He was certain he'd get praised.</i>

340
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,223
What have you done?

341
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,531
<i>Mom tried to pour the ink in the inkstone,</i>

342
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,467
<i>but her hand slipped, so the stone</i>
<i>hit Gon-chan's…</i>

343
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,503
<i>Ouch!</i>

344
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,674
<i>You can still see the inkstone scar</i>
<i>under Gon-chan's chin.</i>

345
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,111
Ouch!

346
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,013
This won't work.

347
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,083
I heard you lost a job.

348
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,252
It's not going well these days.

349
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,156
It's the same with electronics.
If one goes bad, everything follows.

350
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,825
This might be the end for Aoi Minase.

351
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,460
You can marry me, then.

352
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,462
What? Really? You'll have me?

353
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,132
Wait, you're that desperate?
So much that you'd marry me?

354
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,636
-We don't have to have sex, right?
-Cut it out!

355
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,573
In that case, don't go to Hamada.
Eat your leftover curry.

356
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,543
Their salted beef tongue is 1,800 yen,
you know!

357
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,844
It's really good, though.

358
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,179
The mortgage will be tight.

359
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,814
You should move then.

360
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,085
-I can't do that.
-Why?

361
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,756
Sora, huh?

362
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,428
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

363
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,329
Not at all.

364
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,600
Can't believe a trendy café like this
eats taiyaki for snacks.

365
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,303
That's how it is, you know?

366
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,540
Oh, we have a new product.
Do you want one? A soy-ppucino

367
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
-Really?
-Sure.

368
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,320
SUGI BEE GARDEN

369
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,289
<i>This café and the honey shop next door</i>

370
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,925
<i>used to be combined into a single home.</i>

371
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,328
<i>It was our home.</i>

372
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,832
<i>We used to be a traditional photo studio</i>
<i>called Minase Photo Studio.</i>

373
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,903
<i>Apparently, we've taken photos</i>
<i>of the imperial family.</i>

374
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,973
<i>But we were pressured to sell</i>
<i>and my mom's mom…</i>

375
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,877
<i>My grandma and grandpa sold</i>
<i>the photo gallery,</i>

376
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,145
<i>with no regrets at all.</i>

377
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,045
VACANT PLOT

378
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,749
<i>Because this was a prime location</i>
<i>in the middle of the city,</i>

379
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,219
<i>Grandpa and Grandma fulfilled their</i>
<i>lifelong dream of moving to Switzerland.</i>

380
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,822
<i>Now, they live there,</i>
<i>taking photos of mountains.</i>

381
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,158
<i>My mom, a young novelist</i>
<i>just starting out,</i>

382
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,828
<i>was kicked out of home,</i>

383
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,732
<i>but she found success.</i>
<i>To celebrate, she bought herself</i>

384
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,370
<i>a newly-built high rise</i>
<i>just across Suzuran Shopping District.</i>

385
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,273
<i>The title of Mom's novel</i>
<i>from back then was</i>

386
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,341
<i>"The Scent of the Sky."</i>

387
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,977
<i>Pretty, right?</i>

388
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,316
<i>What does the sky smell like?</i>

389
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,527
Um…

390
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,531
Are you okay?

391
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,573
<i>And thus, a fateful encounter…</i>

392
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,310
It spilled, huh?

393
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,312
Here, have this. It's a soy latte.

394
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,350
-That's what you're worried about?
-Are you hurt?

395
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,753
I'm fine.

396
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,256
I'm close to home. I can walk.

397
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,425
-I see.
-Yeah.

398
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,960
Okay. Bye, thanks.

399
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,194
-Wait.
-Huh?

400
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,329
Your glasses.

401
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,931
They're bent out of shape.

402
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:34,967
Huh?

403
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,911
Did they get damaged from the fall?

404
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,783
Maybe before that. Here. Try them now.

405
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,459
-Wow!
-Easy to see, right?

406
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,896
Do you work with glasses?

407
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,333
Not really.

408
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,440
SUZURAN HOT SPRINGS

409
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,509
MEDICAL HEALTH BATH OF THE DAY

410
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,378
Oh, that feels good!

411
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,649
We're in heaven! And the beer after this…

412
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,518
-…will be so good!
-Yeah!

413
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,558
Gon.

414
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,663
Are you not going to get married?

415
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,563
What?

416
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,234
-Why ask now?
-How about you and Aoi?

417
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,138
That'll never happen.

418
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,675
Never. Not in a million years.

419
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,110
Not for forever and ever?

420
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,646
Not even long long ago.

421
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,249
Didn't happen long ago,
won't happen in the future,

422
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,818
not once in this long life, huh?

423
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,221
So sad.

424
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,359
It's Aoi after all.

425
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,896
Why do we always overeat grilled meat?

426
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,265
I could eat grilled meat forever!

427
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,767
After loin, the short rib, and the rumen,
I didn't think

428
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,070
we'd do the salted tongue again, ya know?

429
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,972
-"Ya know?"
-It's a reference to <i>Chibi Maruko.</i>

430
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,277
We should've gotten cold noodles
or bibimbap too! Regrets!

431
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,112
This is bad.

432
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,714
Today's grilled meat was bad?

433
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,651
No, Hamada is always delicious, forever.
The best in Suzuran Shopping District!

434
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,586
-I know.
-No…

435
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,390
What's bad is not the grilled meat,
but our household budget.

436
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,827
Now's not the time to eat out.

437
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,597
Mom, when you're struggling with
a manuscript, you always run to food.

438
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,501
Hamada, Aroma Fresca, Au Mirador,
Calanques, Kokoro and Yomogi… Too much!

439
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,936
You were there too!

440
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,140
Listen up. Our food budget is about to
surpass our income.

441
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,343
Those clothes are Prada, right?
You shopped online again!

442
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,412
No, they're Gucci.

443
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,480
They're both expensive!

444
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,315
You too. That sweater's from Toga, right?

445
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,917
I saw Mei Nagano wear it
in the New Year's show.

446
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,553
-Oh, I remember now!
-What?

447
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,856
Today, on my way home from Comic Market,

448
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,924
I bought some Milk &amp; Violet ice cream.

449
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:13,992
Which flavor?

450
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,728
Limited edition, Amaou Strawberries
and Mascarpone Blend.

451
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,430
Nicknamed "Ama-Mas." I also got Matcha.

452
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,066
-The limited edition is mine!
-No!

453
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,668
That one's for me! Ama-Mas is mine!

454
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,404
I got it!

455
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,671
Hey, are you serious?

456
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,773
I got this myself!

457
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,875
-Are you a kid?
-I had to go to three stores!

458
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,210
-That makes me want it more!
-No.

459
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,580
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Shoot! Shoot!

460
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,858
-Can I have a little?
-No.

461
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,361
-I want a little!
-No.

462
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,666
-Is it good?
-Very much.

463
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,934
You're so mean.

464
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:00,005
I'm training your sense of motherhood.
Parents should give to their children.

465
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,176
LIMITED EDITION
STRAWBERRY MASCARPONE

466
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,447
Mom, I'm going to say it again.

467
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,315
You have ice cream here.

468
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,354
Our budget is in a bad state!

469
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,591
Huh? Why is that there?

470
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,593
I've decided that today was the day.

471
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,764
Okay? Look at this.
Here's our income and our expenses.

472
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,365
BALANCE: -111,020 YEN

473
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,840
This. Look. Look.

474
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,011
<i>We're a mother and a child household.</i>

475
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,416
<i>She was a soft and fluffy baby.</i>

476
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,420
<i>I decided that I'd raise her properly.</i>

477
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,223
<i>I'd do it my way. My own unique way.</i>

478
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,726
<i>She grew up into a wonderful girl</i>

479
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,095
<i>and became my right-hand-man.</i>

480
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,265
<i>I was busy with work, so she took on</i>

481
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:05,504
<i>the household tasks and eventually,</i>
<i>our budget.</i>

482
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,539
<i>She sometimes steals from me,</i>

483
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,774
<i>but we're a mother-daughter team.</i>

484
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,713
<i>She's my partner as we live through</i>
<i>this world.</i>

485
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,750
<i>Even though she only decorates photos</i>
<i>where she looks good.</i>

486
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,684
You say something?

487
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,820
No. You must be hearing things.

488
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,391
Listen up, Mom. Our mortgage for
this place is not looking good.

489
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,960
I know I haven't paid a cent, but…

490
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,396
Of course you haven't. You're in college!

491
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,099
Hey, wanna quit college and work?

492
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,370
Just kidding!

493
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,975
It was tough to lose Kodansha,
Marukawa Books and Chugakukan.

494
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,876
Huh?

495
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,512
Why did they keep Kodansha?

496
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,781
Let's move. Mom, let's move!

497
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,218
Wait. Okay? Wait up. Mom has an idea.

498
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,619
What is it?

499
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,889
<i>UMBILICAL CORD</i>

500
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,325
I'll sell <i>Umbilical Cord!</i>

501
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,262
I'll find a publisher that will
serialize Season Two!

502
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,599
Then, I'll make it a bestseller,
like Harry Potter!

503
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,703
That'll show Saneisha, and Konishi
for abandoning me!

504
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,205
Wow…

505
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,544
RISSEI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

506
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,080
Really good! Can you look more this way?

507
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,014
Sure.

508
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,384
Wow, that's really good.

509
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,490
Are we done here?

510
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,595
He's a model for Men's Non-no.

511
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,697
Oh, really?

512
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,831
Hey, you!

513
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,499
He's kidding.

514
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,869
I bet you could model anywhere.

515
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,539
Can I get one more?

516
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,444
Sure! I'm nice to pretty girls!

517
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,080
Stop! You're making me blush!

518
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,348
Can we take one here?

519
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,017
Isn't that Irino?

520
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,852
It is!

521
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,454
He's being photographed!

522
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,055
Irino!

523
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,259
Hey, Irino!
You're going to the party tonight, right?

524
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,628
That was today?

525
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,330
I'll go. Of course I will.

526
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,765
I'm asking Irino.

527
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:14,966
What does that mean?

528
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,434
I don't feel like it…

529
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,335
Oh, look at him!

530
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,138
Those popular kids…
Members of the light tribe.

531
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,272
Seriously?

532
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,910
I'm the chief of the shadow tribe
in this party school.

533
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,248
I'm a completely different being.
A different being. Different being.

534
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,618
Say it three times, and it's a mantra.
I can reach enlightenment.

535
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,086
BANG!

536
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,921
CRASH!

537
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,827
You're going too, right?
The Cains Seminar party.

538
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,929
No, I'm…

539
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,567
The professor said attendance is
mandatory. Otherwise, you'd fail.

540
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,139
Isn't that what some would call coercion?

541
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,044
I'm just joking!
But it's true, everyone should attend.

542
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,478
I'm planning it. So come.

543
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,081
Seven, at Ikkyu. See ya!

544
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,554
-Konishi.
-Yeah?

545
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,790
About Ms. Minase…

546
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,027
Right. Did she call?
Any ideas for a romance novel?

547
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,296
No, not at all.

548
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,734
You think she's planning to escape?

549
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,502
From us. From Saneisha.

550
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,939
You're a hot guy for a reason, okay?
Don't let her escape.

551
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,712
Hey!

552
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,214
Hey…

553
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,917
Where are we going?

554
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,419
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

555
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,489
I'm not running away!

556
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,592
Huh?

557
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,598
-You pervert!
-Not like that. Why are you here? Why?

558
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,234
I work here part-time.

559
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,506
For eye candy, I assume. Because I'm cute.

560
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,209
Yeah, you are, but…

561
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,682
I want to be by your side forever, Soseki.

562
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,383
That's not cute.

563
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,854
Yes… Yes. It's a little tough?

564
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,023
Come on, give me a chance!

565
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,061
I have ideas for what happens next.

566
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:27,265
Autumn will turn into winter.
And then… Huh?

567
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,968
Oh, you have a meeting?

568
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,871
Wait, what about Gen?

569
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,741
Gen, the editor-in-chief.
I've worked with him before…

570
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,546
Oh? He retired?

571
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,916
It's alright, then.

572
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,951
Goodbye…

573
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,823
AKIKAWA SHORIN BOOKS: SAKURA SUGIMOTO

574
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,093
NEW MAIL: ABOUT THE SERIES PROPOSAL

575
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,561
From Iwatani Books?

576
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:02,367
"Thank you for contacting us
about publishing your series."

577
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,269
"As for <i>Umbilical Cord,"</i>

578
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,472
"we've decided not to go forward
with publishing… "

579
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,183
It's no good. I'll go to bed.

580
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,490
BEDROOM

581
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,171
I had this many ideas…

582
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:43,575
I could've continued to Season Ten
if needed…

583
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,610
Canceled…

584
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,415
NOTEBOOK

585
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,456
Oh… Am I crying?

586
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,511
Hello?

587
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,447
Hello, it's Tachibana from Saneisha.

588
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,417
Ogai, right?
Your name is more impressive than you!

589
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,087
<i>I'm Soseki. Ogai's my brother.</i>

590
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,089
Then the same for your brother!

591
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,291
He won the Nobel Prize.

592
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,160
No way! Like Haruki Murakami?

593
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,497
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>
<i>Also, Murakami has never won it.</i>

594
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,800
Are you alright? Did something happen?

595
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,339
It's nothing.

596
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,475
<i>Your nose sounds stuffy.</i>

597
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,511
That's how I sound. Also, I have sinuses.

598
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,246
<i>I see.</i>

599
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,516
Do you have any ideas
for the romance novel?

600
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,421
-I'm still thinking!
<i>-I see.</i>

601
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,494
About <i>Umbilical Cord…</i>

602
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,529
Yeah?

603
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,532
You have two more spots for your series
on Raphael.

604
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,002
<i>Konishi said to end it in two chapters.</i>

605
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,041
I can write 40 more chapters if needed.

606
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,944
I have the plot and everything.
How stupid of me.

607
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,080
<i>You're sincere and diligent, Ms. Minase.</i>

608
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,849
Huh?

609
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,651
That's how I felt reading your novels.

610
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,821
You're serious about your work.

611
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,096
Okay. Two chapters, right?

612
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,098
I can end it.

613
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,172
"BUT THEN, OUR PLAN WOULD FAIL…"

614
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,022
I feel sick…

615
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,695
Hikaru, I invited Minase, too.

616
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,296
Who's Minase?

617
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,900
Oh, that gloomy girl?
She's always by herself.

618
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,002
Hey, Tanaka, look carefully.

619
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,837
She's actually got a pretty face.

620
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,005
But she's an otaku, right?

621
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,540
Or a Boys' Love fan-girl?

622
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,342
Ew…

623
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,580
Did she hear us?

624
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,850
Is there more beer?

625
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,719
What are you drinking?

626
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,656
It stinks!

627
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,892
-Good, right?
-You like this?

628
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,527
What? It's good!

629
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,630
-It's cilantro.
-I want to try!

630
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,265
It tastes bad. You shouldn't.

631
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,033
What are you drinking?

632
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,968
-Calpis.
-Calpis?

633
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,177
What? Why did you do that?

634
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,812
Don't make fun of me.

635
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,049
I just thought it was cute.

636
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,185
Huh? What are you saying?

637
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,855
I'll be going now. I need to see an anime.

638
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,331
BATHROOMS ARE THIS WAY

639
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,239
No one will come after me, of course.

640
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,217
<i>UMBILICAL CORD</i>
SEASON 2

641
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,489
I can't write.

642
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,893
I can't write a single word…

643
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,090
-Hey, today…
-Yeah?

644
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,192
Someone threw an edamame at me.

645
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,562
What the heck? Who?

646
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,897
A classmate.

647
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,798
-A girl?
-A girl.

648
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,902
That's cute. What did you do?

649
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,336
Nothing.

650
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,208
You didn't do anything,
but she threw an edamame at you?

651
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,577
-A confession of love, maybe?
-What the hell?

652
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,946
Are you staying over?

653
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,550
Can I?

654
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,452
You're welcome to.

655
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,923
APARTMENT FOR RENT

656
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,291
What's this?

657
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,427
I found this on the way home from school.
I think it's good.

658
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:40,932
Minamijujou? That's outside of Tokyo!

659
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,733
It's accessible to the center of Tokyo.

660
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,570
It's only one train ride to my school.

661
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,472
I didn't ask you to find a house!

662
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,575
It's just a pamphlet.

663
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,810
You don't believe in your mom?

664
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,147
Did <i>Umbilical Cord</i> sell to another
publisher then?

665
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,382
No, but…

666
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,519
Then why not? I'm sure they have
cheap onions and potatoes there.

667
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,688
But they don't have Hamada!

668
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,824
Keep saying that,
and we'll keep losing money!

669
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,894
It's your pride that keeps you in
Minato Ward.

670
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,663
Yeah, but…

671
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,467
Prada and Louis Vuitton,
it's all your pride.

672
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,836
This house is filled with your pride.

673
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,272
But without my Pradas and Vuittons,

674
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,875
I can feel myself ending.

675
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,312
It feels like the end of Aoi Minase!

676
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:32,350
All I know is to write.
How will I raise you?

677
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,418
I'm suffering here for you, you know?

678
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,989
What? Don't use me as an excuse
for your creative block.

679
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,092
What is that tone?

680
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,494
Is that how you talk to a parent?

681
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,831
If you went to a national school,
it would've been a little easier.

682
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,268
Sorry I'm not smart like you, Mom.

683
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:54,038
You think that I should've at least
gotten into a private school like Waseda.

684
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,308
What? I never thought that.

685
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,609
Of course you do!

686
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,878
You said you want me to go
because that's where you went!

687
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,648
I just recommended it because
it's a good school!

688
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:07,818
Anyways, I never asked you
to write for me.

689
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,521
You decided to write. You got famous.
I'm not a part of it.

690
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,690
What are you saying?

691
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,258
I'm the one who raised you!

692
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,528
Here it is. What a cliché line. So lame!

693
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,631
If you don't like it, leave!
This is my house!

694
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:24,502
I'm the one who bought this house! Leave!

695
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,704
No need to tell me.

696
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,741
If you want to be spoken to like a mother,
then act like a mother!

697
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,914
What does that mean?

698
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,450
-How many of my teachers can you name?
-What?

699
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,420
Any of my teachers from elementary school
to high school.

700
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,762
Mr. Hirano! Your teacher in middle school!

701
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,066
I can't take this!

702
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,165
ODAYA: OPEN

703
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,569
Hey Dad, about the sanmayaki…

704
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,337
-Kenta said custard cream might…
-Ow!

705
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,039
Ow, ouch…

706
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,509
I'm so sorry!

707
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,211
But I can't see you, you know?

708
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,280
Don't bury yourself like a cat…

709
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,683
Huh?

710
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,820
Are you crying?

711
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,348
I have to write.

712
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:34,865
Here you are.

713
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,076
ODAYA

714
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,480
It's so warm.

715
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,716
Sure.

716
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,486
Just like your mom.

717
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,823
You're so cheesy, Gon-chan.

718
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,092
Yup. I'm a cheesy man.

719
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:05,896
Hey, Gon-chan.

720
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,168
The only teacher that Mom remembered

721
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,972
was a hot teacher named Mr. Hirano.

722
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,542
She loves hot guys.

723
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,915
Hey.

724
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,221
Your mom doesn't sell that house
for you, Sora.

725
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,023
Me?

726
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,627
You can see Zojirushi from
your room, right?

727
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:42,433
That cute elephant? It's a good design.

728
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,404
When you were a kid,
your mom would pick you up when you cried

729
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,640
to show you the elephant.
Then you'd stop crying.

730
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,278
I've heard that story a lot.

731
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:59,350
She said Zojirushi's there
as a stand-in for Dad.

732
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,319
She said it's our guardian…

733
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,625
You like Zojirushi, right?

734
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,667
Yeah. It's even my wallpaper.

735
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:18,836
Seriously?

736
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:26,544
It still calms me down when I look at it.

737
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:33,817
Like in high school, when I didn't make
first chair in brass band,

738
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,989
or when I didn't get into
a national school for college.

739
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,392
I looked at that elephant.

740
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,996
It calms me down.

741
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,134
It's kinda lame so
I was keeping it a secret.

742
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:57,107
But your mom knew, huh?
That "A leopard can't change its spots."

743
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,810
It calms me.

744
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,513
It's your guardian, after all.

745
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,381
NEW PRODUCT: SANMAYAKI

746
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,724
Anything that's important for you, Sora,

747
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,928
is way more important for your mom.

748
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,570
She should just say it.

749
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,172
Hey, come on…

750
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,041
Even Aoi has some things she can't say.

751
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,645
You probably think she says everything
that's in her head, but…

752
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,882
Well, she does say most things.

753
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,920
But not the important stuff.

754
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,826
Your mom's always

755
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,930
cheering you on, Sora.

756
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,538
Gon-chan.
Do you have red bean soup for Mom?

757
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,974
Sure do!

758
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,390
Mom!

759
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,361
Mom, what's wrong?

760
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:28,632
Mom! Mom! Mom, what's wrong?

761
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,668
-What's wrong?
-I was looking at this.

762
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,503
Huh?

763
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,205
Me, you, and the elephant.

764
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,343
You must've been in kindergarten
when you drew this.

765
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,619
What is it?

766
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,624
What is it?

767
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:04,401
In here… In this house,

768
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,439
three-year-old you, nine-year-old you,

769
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,075
they're all here.

770
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,727
What are you doing, Mom?

771
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,763
We're moving to Minamijujou, right?
For the memories.

772
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,999
-No, Mom!
-What?

773
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,903
Aoi Minase can't move to Minamijujou!

774
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,574
That would be the end! You'd stop
wearing Prada or Vuitton or Marni.

775
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,708
You'd shop at Unishiro!

776
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,010
Unishiro has up to XXXXL.

777
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,879
You'd lose your figure!

778
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,581
It's already slipping away!

779
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,051
<i>Umbilical Cord</i>'s ending after
two chapters,

780
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,654
and I can't even write that.
I have to quit writing…

781
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:02,326
I was gone for a little bit,
and her morale is so low.

782
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,462
Hey, Mom. What will you do in Minamijujou?

783
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,664
I'll work at a supermarket.

784
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,934
Mom. A customer
bought something for 878 yen.

785
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,370
They paid 1003 yen. What's the change?

786
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,006
-Two hundred…
-See?

787
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,908
All you know is to write.

788
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:22,279
You were born to write.
So many people are waiting for your book.

789
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,415
But after finishing <i>Umbilical Cord</i>
in two chapters,

790
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,119
I have to write a romance novel.
Otherwise, I have no path.

791
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,988
What? A romance novel?

792
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,190
Yeah. Did I not mention?

793
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,926
They said they'd publish if I write
a romance novel.

794
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,597
But I can't write those anymore!
I don't know love.

795
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,835
-I'll help.
-How?

796
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,237
I'll find romance!

797
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,406
What?

798
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,676
I'll find love, and you can write
about that!

799
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:58,248
You? The otaku and Boys' Love fan?

800
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,018
Is an otaku Boys' Love fan falling in
love a bad story?

801
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,554
No, it might be really good.

802
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,257
More than anything, I'm so happy
you're interested in that!

803
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,960
I was so worried that you'd never
get a boyfriend

804
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,131
and keep reading bloody manga
and manga about men making out.

805
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,332
BL, you mean.

806
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,935
I was so worried about you!

807
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,136
That much?

808
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:23,273
I'll write a romance novel! I'll do it!

809
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,810
I'm so excited for you to find love!

810
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,078
Yay!

811
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,414
-Ouch!
-What's wrong?

812
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,784
I can't raise my right arm these days.
I have frozen shoulder…

813
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,085
Ow, ouch…

814
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:35,986
CHIROPRACTIC: TAIYOU-DO

815
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:40,023
But actually, if it's an otaku
main character, it'd be a light novel.

816
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,325
A light novel?

817
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,961
Yeah. It's what young people read.

818
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,629
That's not really what I write.

819
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,098
I see. I didn't know about light novels.

820
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,135
So really, I have to find love.

821
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,339
If I can remember that sparkle
in my heart, I can write again…

822
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,573
Ouch!

823
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,378
A sparkle is good and all,
but your shoulders are in terrible state.

824
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,148
I need backup.
I'll go call the other doctor.

825
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,049
The Director?

826
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,118
No, he retired the other day.

827
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,853
We have a new doctor.

828
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,488
Can you come here, sir?

829
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,859
Excuse me.

830
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:18,528
<i>A young man?</i>

831
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,366
Your scapula and humerus are
stuck together.

832
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,936
Yes, my scapula and humerus…

833
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,237
Excuse me for a sec.

834
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,809
Okay. Try getting up.

835
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,883
Raise your right arm.

836
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:42,920
Oh, okay.

837
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,857
Oh, it worked! I can raise my arm!

838
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,058
Wow!

839
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,961
A little more, like this…

840
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,203
It's all fixed.

841
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,572
Thank you.

842
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:08,145
If you have the time, please come again.

843
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,080
Yes!

844
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,016
-I'm sure you're busy, but…
-Huh?

845
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,019
I'm reading your series on Raphael.
<i>Umbilical Cord.</i>

846

I'm a big fan! I have all your books!

847
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,358
Ouch!

848
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,128
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

849
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:28,198
-Be careful!
-Because you're so tall…

850
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm sorry. Thank you.

851
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,034
Wow…

852
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,572
I was so nervous. So lame…

853
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,476
So…

854
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,212
