1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,371
Mom fell in love in the most shallow way
possible.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:06,706
Cute…

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,808
Her daughter, me,

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,744
also had a fateful encounter.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,045
Are you okay?

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,750
And it was with the same person!

7
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,185
The end! That's everything that
happened in Episode One.

8
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,820
What the hell? That's it?

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,189
Mom, language. You're too old to swear.

10
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,091
Well, Miss Sora,

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,527
I felt that the explanation
was insufficient.

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,596
We only have one precious hour a week…

13
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,965
-Let's begin the next episode. Enjoy!
-Enjoy!

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,600
CHIROPRACTIC: TAIYOU-DO

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,471
I feel it.

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,839
Something's coming.

17
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,208
Huh? What's coming?

18
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,111
A storm? A hurricane?

19
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,480
It's the middle of winter.

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,949
A big snowstorm or something?

21
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,619
No, something more…

22
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,988
Something more powerful.

23
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,861
Alright. Good.

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,398
CLASS CANCELLATION

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,813
<i>Hey, is Mom pretty?</i>

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,548
What the hell…?

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>Isn't that too much makeup?</i>

28
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,358
<i>Much more than when</i>
<i>your stylist Arai does it.</i>

29
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,994
<i>Is it an interview? TV?</i>

30
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,129
<i>A book signing?</i>

31
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,230
The chiropractor!

32
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,131
THE CHIROPRACTOR

33
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,566
THE CHIROPRACTOR

34
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,467
<i>The chiropractor?</i>

35
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,970
Yes. Remember I have a frozen shoulder?

36
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,108
It's actually much better, but…

37
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,978
Huh? Is it too much?

38
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,248
Hello, it's Tachibana from Saneisha.

39
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:56,749
Soseki, right?

40
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,918
I'm honored you remember my name.

41
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,387
I doubt most people can forget that name.

42
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,290
For the Early Spring 100 Books Fair,

43
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,360
your novel <i>The Perfect Date</i>
will be featured.

44
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,163
-It's been decided.
-Well, that's good.

45
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,901
It used to be Aoi Minase's
100 Books Fair a few years ago.

46
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,802
<i>Oh…</i>

47
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,470
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

48
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,807
Hey! It's a joke!
I haven't written 100 books!

49
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,510
<i>Also, Ms. Minase, about the new novel…</i>

50
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:24,844
Stop right there!

51
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,713
I have it.

52
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,215
-An idea!
<i>-Wow!</i>

53
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,154
I'm going to go find love right now!

54
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,222
Is that the title?

55
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,590
No.

56
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,627
A woman in her forties is going to
fall in love with a chiropractor.

57
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,063
Well, I'll say she's in her forties,
but she doesn't look it.

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,666
She looks around 30, maybe.

59
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,868
A romance with a chiropractor?

60
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,138
Is that something like,

61
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,606
she got touched

62
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,708
<i>and felt something, or…</i>

63
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,944
Anyways, that's the proposal.

64
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,679
Tell Konishi that, okay?

65
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,686
"Unemployment develops, that is to say,

66
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,388
because people want the moon."

67
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,923
This is what Keynes said.

68
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,957
If people accept

69
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,092
that fresh cheese and the moon
are the same…

70
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,594
Keynes…

71
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,729
What are you saying exactly?

72
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,598
It makes no sense at all.

73
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,267
Fresh cheese represents fiat money.

74
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,136
If the loan is money,

75
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,338
and everyone wants a loan…

76
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,439
Oh.

77
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,676
What are you doing?

78
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,279
What were you drawing instead of listening

79
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,181
to my very interesting lecture?

80
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,385
The people desiring the moon.

81
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,091
-So good!
-Wow! Nice!

82
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,393
Well,

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,495
I'll be taking this.

84
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,998
-You can't, Professor!
-Huh?

85
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,766
Don't throw it away.

86
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,171
I can't throw this away?

87
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,907
It's fine. Go ahead.

88
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,875
It's just a doodle.

89
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,210
Then, can I have it?

90
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,849
Alright. We're finished.

91
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,985
Thank you so much.

92
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,466
Oh god!

93
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,202
Thank you so much.

94
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,639
For frozen shoulder,

95
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,642
women in their fifties risk
damaging their rotator cuffs,

96
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,610
so don't move it if it's painful.

97
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,946
-Huh…
-What?

98
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,050
-Fifties?
-Yes, indeed.

99
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,052
You need to maintain good blood flow.

100
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,021
So make sure your shoulder doesn't
get cold.

101
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,323
A hot bath might be good.

102
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,457
Doctor,

103
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm actually in my forties.

104
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,929
Hm?

105
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,998
Not a woman in her fifties,
but in her forties.

106
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,368
Oh, your age? You're in your forties?

107
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,970
Yes.

108
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,873
-I'm in my forties.
-Oh, I see.

109
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,243
-And how old are you?
-Twenty-five.

110
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,480
ODAYA

111
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,820
Isn't that rude? Do I look like
I'm in my fifties?

112
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,724
For a 25-year-old,
40, 50… It's all the same.

113
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,059
You're an old woman.

114
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,761
Here you are! <i>Sanmayaki</i>

115
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,662
and <i>mitsumame.</i>

116
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,098
If you eat that much,
you'll get a stomachache.

117
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,866
She's stress-eating!

118
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,603
It was so short!

119
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,639
The romance only lasted three days.

120
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,876
That's not real romance.

121
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,780
Hey, listen to this.
I created a new recipe.

122
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,517
Gorgonzola-flavored <i>taiyaki.</i>

123
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,453
-You want one?
-Nope.

124
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,155
Minase?

125
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,191
RISSEI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT

126
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,827
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

127
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,729
-Wait up.
-I'm in a rush.

128
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,697
-I'll hurry too then.
-Hey, Irino!

129
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,232
-You're going to karaoke, right?
-Yeah.

130
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,301
-The usual spot, Karaoke Zanmai.
-Okay!

131
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,769
-We'll see you there.
-Got it.

132
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,970
Okay, bye!

133
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,276
I placed seventh
in a national track tournament

134
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,045
back in high school.

135
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,246
You can't outrun me.

136
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,349
A popular kid like you

137
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,952
shouldn't talk to a nerdy kid like me.

138
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,887
The whole school will laugh at you.

139
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,323
-Is this a prank?
-That's so sad.

140
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,694
Why are you so cold?

141
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,163
Did I do anything to make you hate me?

142
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,333
Oh, the drawing from class.

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,734
Here you are.

144
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,670
Oh, hey, what…

145
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,109
Why did you do that?

146
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,044
You threw edamame too. You're a thrower!

147
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,216
Hey! Wait! I need to talk to you!

148
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,785
It's important!

149
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,522
Oh! Ow!

150
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,758
What's with that guy?

151
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,896
A housewife in her forties
in love with a chiropractor?

152
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,198
Actually,
I don't think she said housewife.

153
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,101
A woman in her forties and a chiropractor?

154
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,002
Yes.

155
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,971
Would that be any good?

156
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,407
A Japanese Harlequin Romance story?

157
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,743
I thought it sounded pretty standard, but…

158
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,045
She told me to tell you
to push that proposal through.

159
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,247
Geez.

160
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,452
Is even the great Aoi Minase floundering?

161
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,522
I was the one who discovered her,
you know?

162
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,358
Her debut was when
she was still in college.

163
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,396
She got her big break with
<i>The Scent of the Sky</i> at 23.

164
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,666
Oh, I'm the one that opened
the character for scent.

165

00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,169
Otherwise, it was like an ad for Resesh.

167
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,505
Resesh? The spray?

168
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,773
The air freshener?

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,374
Now that you mention it…

170
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,609
<i>THE SCENT OF THE SKY</i>

171
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,711
Those who get their break early struggle.

172
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,047
Because they have to stay relevant
for a long time.

173
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,916
Minase started selling in her early 20s.

174
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,453
In this world, where you can't
catch a weasel alive,

175
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,689
being able to continue writing
is as hard as

176
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,525
winning the lottery.

177
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,596
Excuse me, Konishi,
but it's "catch a weasel asleep."

178
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,266
I said that on purpose, Soseki.

179
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,568
You work hard too.

180
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,938
I let you join my team
despite your issues.

181
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,941
If you don't prove yourself,
you'll get transferred again.

182
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,043
Yes. I understand.

183
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,647
-Sit down.
-Welcome!

184
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,148
Here you are.

185
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,150
Order anything you like.

186
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,186
-I just got paid at my job.
-Welcome.

187
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,054
Okay.

188
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,924
-Everything on this page.
-Wait a minute!

189
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,325
Hot chocolate, please.

190
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,328
-I'll have a coffee.
-Coming right up.

191
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,008
They don't have <i>Jump.</i>

192
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,877
I wanted to read <i>Chainsaw Man.</i>

193
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,146
<i>Demon Slayer</i> is fine too.

194
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,416
But I'm really drawn to <i>Chainsaw Man.</i>

195
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,019
It didn't hook me in the beginning, but…

196
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,887
What? What did you just say?

197
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,455
It was good from Chapter One.

198
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,259
You haven't read <i>Fire Punch?</i>
The author's previous work. You should.

199
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,961
It was on <i>Jump Plus.</i>

200
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,462
Or do you only read on paper?

201
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,633
<i>Chainsaw Man</i> is so freaking good.

202
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,236
I can feel my brain exploding.

203
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,771
I love it.

204
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,446
You know,

205
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,749
I've seen you before.

206
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,618
What?

207
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,554
I see you every week
at the Keynes Seminar.

208
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,058
I'm just a background character.

209
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,359
You probably haven't noticed.

210
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,962
No, somewhere else.

211
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,798
Even though you threw edamame
at me at the restaurant the other day.

212
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,567
It's somewhere else.

213
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,971
-Somewhere else?
-Yeah.

214
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,240
Where?

215
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,510
-At Comic Market.
-What?

216
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,348
Wait. Me being at Comiket

217
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,917
is like a camel drinking water
in a desert oasis.

218
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,886
-What does that mean?
-It means it's obvious.

219
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,155
Oh, okay.

220
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,424
Why were you there?

221
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,527
So you're an <i>otaku</i> too?

222
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,467
Bingo! I disguise myself when I go.

223
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,870
I wear glasses, a wig, a plaid flannel,
and a vest with so many pockets.

224
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,772
You'd never recognize me.

225
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,510
You were wearing a cosplay of Shiki
from <i>Edens Zero</i> and had a huge suitcase.

226
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,978
Can we get a picture?

227
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,747
-So cool!
-That's dope!

228
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,081
So cool!

229
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,450
You look just like him!

230
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,320
-You saw me?
-I did.

231
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,591
-You saw what was in my suitcase?
-It's fine.

232
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,559
I'm open to all genres.

233
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,762
NL, BL, GL. I read everything!

234
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,865
I don't have a preference either way,

235
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,433
but I read everything.

236
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,068
The open-minded type, huh?

237
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,107
Please keep it a secret.

238
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,343
Oh, sure…

239
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,745
But why?

240
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,480
My public image is Hikaru Irino,

241
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,516
the social, nice, handsome guy.

242
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,618
I successfully self-branded in college.

243
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,520
I don't intend on throwing that away.

244
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,155
Why not?

245
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,692
Oh, so you can get with cute girls?

246
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:33,926
You get it.

247
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,062
You're the worst. Go to karaoke already.

248
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,431
-They were inviting you.
-I'm not going.

249
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,267
I don't want to only sing
Kenshi Yonezu or Hige Dan.

250
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,437
I only want to sing anime songs.

251
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,539
You're a real <i>otaku.</i>

252
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,774
Here you are!

253
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,643
-Hot chocolate.
-Thank you.

254
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,079
-Hot coffee.
-Thank you, sir.

255
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,914
Here's your check.

256
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,183
Enjoy!

257
00:11:58,984 --> 00:11:59,885
Anyways.

258
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,390
This drawing is wonderful.

259
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,026
-It's just a doodle.
-No.

260
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,228
Your eye level is stable,
the stipples are cool,

261
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,330
and your perspective is good.

262
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,535
Let's make manga together.

263
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,606
-Huh?
-I'll write the story, you draw.

264
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,875
We'll become the kings of <i>Jump!</i>

265
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,379
No way!

266
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,882
He's gone crazy! This isn't <i>Bakuman.</i>

267
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,485
So, are you going to do it?

268
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,719
No way.

269
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,788
Our series would never be Number One
on <i>Jump,</i>

270
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,990
let alone have it made into an anime.

271
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,127
And anyways, I don't even know
how to draw manga!

272
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,529
But you've always been good at drawing.

273
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,464
That's not relevant.

274
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,867
If all good drawers
could get a series on <i>Jump,</i>

275
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,569
<i>Jump</i> magazines would be this thick!

276
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,138
Like a telephone book.

277
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,773
Probably more.

278
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,941
You should try.

279
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,611
What?

280
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,646
Ever since you were a kid,

281
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,783
you always gave up before you even tried.

282
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,519
When I said you could go to art school

283
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,521
because you're good at art,

284
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,157
you said there was no guarantee
you'd earn a living

285
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,459
because that only happens
to a small group of people.

286
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,960
So you went to a regular college.

287
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,962
What's wrong with that?

288
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,365
There's nothing wrong, but…

289
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,368
It's such a waste. You're so talented.

290
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,971
Not everyone

291
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,507
can become successful like you, Mom.

292
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,111
That's not what I'm saying.

293
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,379
Yes, it is!

294
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,382
Things worked out for you,
so you don't know

295
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,484
what it's like to be scared.

296
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,352
Hey, you're pushing it.

297
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,554
I'm not!

298
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,023
I have regrets about art school too,
you know.

299
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,794
-You do? In that case…
-I knew that's what you'd say!

300
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,597
The world isn't as easy
as you think it is, Mom!

301
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,300
Not everyone can live
a lighthearted life like you!

302
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm heading out.

303
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,716
-Listen, Kenta.
-Yes.

304
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:48,320
You have to listen closely
to the sound of the beans.

305
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,923
What, really?

306
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,258
It's true!

307
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,126
If you listen closely…

308
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,829
Simmer, simmer…

309
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,796
Huh?

310
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,665
"Not yet. Not yet."

311
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,635
You can hear that, right?

312
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,769
I see.

313
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,284
MOM

314
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:10,669
<i>TURNING, FIGHT</i>

315
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,443
<i>AOI MINASE</i>

316
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,580
<i>THE TRANSPARENT YOU</i>

317
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,385
Oh.

318
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,187
<i>AOI MINASE</i>

319
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,088
It's nothing.

320
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,163
<i>AN OFFHANDED GOODBYE</i>

321
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,071
It's time for dinner.

322
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,073
What are you dancing?

323
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,075
Dance with me.

324
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,511
Why?

325
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,020
Your mom and I went to see her.

326
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,354
It's Janis Ian.

327
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,491
Right.

328
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,861
You've told me many times.

329
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,096
-At the Budokan, right?
-Yeah.

330
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,767
That was a great concert.

331
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,809
It's a vintage item at this point.

332
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,612
I like the needles.

333
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,647
The way you place them softly.

334
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,020
You really love Mom, don't you?

335
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,022
Even now.

336
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,893
When I listen to this song, I remember it

337
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,062
like it was yesterday.

338
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,968
Mom didn't have a great son,

339
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,870
but she had a great husband.

340
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,606
That's how it is.

341
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,644
The son isn't so bad either.

342
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,786
CARAMEL SOY-PPUCINO

343
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>The guy from the other day.</i>

344
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,811
Are you okay?

345
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,782
<i>I met him again!</i>

346
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,896
You are…

347
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,267
From that time!

348
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,610
Your glasses?

349
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,745
Huh?

350
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,714
How are your glasses?

351
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,484
Oh, excuse me.

352
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,689
Ouch! I'm sorry.

353
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,224
Oh!

354
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,827
I'm so sorry.

355
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,535
I'm too tall for this place.

356
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,838
I bump into everything.

357
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,344
How tall are you?

358
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,549
I always lie and say 187 centimeters,

359
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,816
but I'm actually 190.

360
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,252
It's too tall, it's weird, right?

361
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,788
Not at all.

362
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,024
I'm short, so I'm jealous.

363
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,560
It's cute when girls are short.

364
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,628
What?

365
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,400
What were you reading?

366
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,168
Oh, this?

367
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,338
<i>AN OFFHANDED GOODBYE</i>

368
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,806
-B-ah!
-What?

369
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,509
That was otterly weird. Get otter here!

370
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,745
-What is that?
-You don't know?

371
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,281
-It's a manga reference.
-I don't know it.

372
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,417
Do they also say "B-ah!"
when they're surprised?

373
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,886
No, this is <i>otaku</i> talk…

374
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,724
No, I was imitating the call of a Pokémon,

375
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,094
beloved by everyone in Japan.

376
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,264
It was a fun play on words.

377
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,801
-You're funny.
-Not at all.

378
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,337
-Do you have any more?
-What?

379
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,038
Other than the otter.

380
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,176
-I do. There's a LINE stamp for it…
-No.

381
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,078
Your own version,

382
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,779
if possible.

383
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,287
Purple…Girdle…

384
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,357
Purple…Girdle…

385
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,293
Pig-nosed turtle.

386
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,928
PIG-NOSED TURTLE

387
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,265
Pig-nosed turtle, huh?

388
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,966
I liked the otter one more.

389
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,436
Otters are cute, aren't they?

390
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,872
I've never seen one.

391
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,641
Oh, did you know?

392
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,744
There's an Asian small-clawed otter baby
at Ueno Zoo.

393
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,079
Really? They have one at Ueno Zoo?

394
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,115
Want to go see it together?

395
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,017
What?

396
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,460
What's happening?

397
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,529
Hey, old lady.

398
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,065
Are you going in or not?

399
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,767
I'm not.

400
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,604
Welcome.

401
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,909
ODAYA

402
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,215
Hot! So good! The radish is so good!

403
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,950
That's good.

404
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,287
You eat a lot, don't you?

405
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,090
-I pay for my food!
-Scooch over.

406
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,426
A percentage of our sales are supported

407
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,828
by Aoi's appetite.

408
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,900
You're drinking?

409
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,769
Are you sad that your daughter
got the hot guy?

410
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,539
I don't care about that at all.

411
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,908
I was just really surprised.

412
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,409
Really, really surprised!

413
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,645
I think it's my first time

414
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,647
seeing her smile at a boy.

415
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,350
The last time was in preschool,

416
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,719
when she was playing
in the sandbox with Shuhei.

417
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,520
Is Sora okay?

418
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,725
She's really not.
She's an <i>otaku,</i> you know?

419
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,859
She reads <i>Chainsaw Man</i>,

420
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,395
a manga where a boy
wears his own intestines as a scarf.

421
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,597
I don't get it.

422
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,134
Are you afraid of losing your daughter
to a boy?

423
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,937
That's not it, Shunichiro!

424
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,940
I'm afraid she'll get dumped!

425
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,875
She's an <i>otaku,</i>

426
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,444
you know?

427
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,614
It's like… Oh, I know!

428
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,150
Like that one time at preschool
sports day, she started running

429
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,651
in the opposite direction.

430
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,087
I was watching from the parents' seat,

431
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,056
and didn't know what to do.

432
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,392
Everyone else finished except for her.

433
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,460
Obviously. Since she was running
the wrong way!

434
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,729
And then finally, she realized,

435
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,966
"I'm all by myself.
There's no one around me."

436
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,702
And she just stood there!

437
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,105
Just remembering makes me cry from pity!

438
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,540
How old was she back then?

439
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,576
She was in the Bunny Class, so… Three?

440
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,179
Oh, I felt bad for her then.

441
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,815
You were there, Dad?

442
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,886
Never mind. Check this out!

443
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:45,424
How nice! A plum and a bush warbler.

444
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,626
It's almost February, after all.

445
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,061
<i>Japanese hanging scrolls must get ahead</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

446
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,898
That was Nako's favorite.

447
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,534
I see.
Today's her monthly death anniversary.

448
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,203
Exactly. Good memory.

449
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,639
Plum and bush warbler, willow and swallow,

450
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,041
Japanese maple and deer, bamboo and tiger.

451
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,910
Oden and sake!

452
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,494
<i>Nako is Gon-chan's mother.</i>

453
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,396
<i>Shunichro's wife.</i>

454
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,097
<i>She passed away seven years ago.</i>

455
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,201
<i>Mom was close to her as a neighbor…</i>

456
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,804
<i>No, Mom thought of her as her own mother.</i>

457
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,739
<i>Mom took care of Nako.</i>

458
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,175
<i>Because back then,</i>

459
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,677
<i>Gon-chan wasn't in Japan.</i>

460
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,083
<i>Gon-chan didn't get to see his mother</i>
<i>on her deathbed.</i>

461
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,388
Alright. Now Nako's in a good mood,

462
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,757
along with her favorite scroll.

463
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,795
Let's drink, the three of us!

464
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,330
We danced to Janis Ian too.

465
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,331
What?

466
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,600
Let's drink, Aoi.

467
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:03,902
Yes!

468
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,971
I've already started though.

469
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,939
Mom!

470
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,143
Mom!

471
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,729
Oh.

472
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,938
<i>It's like the moon's about to fall!</i>

473
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,875
You here, Mom?

474
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,980
Is that how you enter someone's home?

475
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,950
Excuse me.

476
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,320
-Huh? What is it?
-We're going home.

477
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,456
-What is it? I haven't had the tofu yet…
-What's wrong, Sora?

478
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,458
-Something has happened.
-What do you mean?

479
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,894
-Something cataclysmic!
-What happened?

480
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,729
It's a date.

481
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,565
-What?
-Huh?

482
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,300
We must strategize!

483
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,135
Gon-chan can help!

484
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,604
Hey, I know all about dates!

485
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,738
-Ask me!
-No, me.

486
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,541
No. I can't rely on old men
who can't get women.

487
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,475
What?

488
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,678
I'll ask my mother,
the queen of romance novels.

489
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,417
-Give up on your tofu.
-What?

490
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,352
Let's go.

491
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,955
It's imprinting.

492
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,757
She's been telling Sora from birth
that she gets all the men

493
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,359
and we don't get women.

494
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,529
That's true. Kids always think
the first adult they see is their parent.

495
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,530
Huh?

496
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,165
That's not exactly right, Dad.

497
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,600
It's close enough.

498
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,971
But, I'm sure that Aoi was
popular with the boys.

499
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,007
Not really.
Her personality was her downfall.

500
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,242
I'm sure she was popular.

501
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,011
You just didn't see.

502
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,349
You're mean, Shunichiro!

503
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,622
It's cold.

504
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,991
So cold!

505
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,931
You're just wearing
a puffer over your pajamas.

506
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, I wasn't really thinking.

507
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,369
You went outside in that?

508
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,505
Suzuran Shopping District is my yard!

509
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,606
Odaya is our…

510
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,841
-Kitchen!
-Kitchen!

511
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,678
You stopped growing.

512
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,014
-We're about the same height.
-Really?

513
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,482
I'll grow more.

514
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,284
Is that true?
I thought you'd grow taller than me!

515
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,053
I'll grow more.

516
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,287
Oh, did you know?

517
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,190
There's surgery abroad to
increase your height.

518
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,160
I do. It's pretty popular,
they're being flooded with bookings.

519
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,262
But it's really expensive!

520
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,597
I guess we can't then.

521
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,399
I'm heading out.

522
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,100
-Good night.
-Good night.

523
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,636
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

524
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,372
Hello. Sorry to bother you,
it's Tachibana.

525
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,141
Oh, Soseki.

526
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,177
You're not bothering me,
but I already quit Saneisha.

527
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,180
I wanted to ask you about Ms. Minase.

528
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,084
Love between a woman in her forties
and a chiropractor?

529
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,420
Yes. She hasn't called
since proposing that.

530
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,989
Should I bug her about this?

531
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,725
Writers need time to solidify their ideas.

532
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,226
Leave her alone for a bit.

533
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,395
I read the ending of <i>Umbilical.</i>

534
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,197
How was it?

535
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,131
<i>UMBILICAL CORD</i>
CHAPTER 2, FINAL CHAPTER

536
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,734
Well… it did feel forced.

537
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,636
I felt a writer's pride, though.

538
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,972
Well, finishing in two chapters
was like playing in

539
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,340
Extra-Hard Mode.

540
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,043
Extra-Hard Mode?
What's that, young people talk?

541
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,944
Whatever.

542
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,614
I think she feels very weak
right now as a writer.

543
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,417
Because of stupid Konishi,
she's only seeing numbers.

544
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,387
I wanted to protect her.

545
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,989
<i>Is that the reason</i>

546
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,257
<i>you quit Saneisha?</i>

547
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,627
I'm a woman,

548
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,196
and I was too weak.

549
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,231
Soseki,

550
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,734
you climb to the top and protect Ms. Aoi.

551
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,270
Do I have to climb to the top to do that?

552
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,673
<i>If you continue to be an employee,</i>
<i>then yes.</i>

553
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,243
It'll be alright.
She fights hard when it's needed.

554
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,012
She's probably writing that new novel

555
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,347
as we speak.

556
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,916
You're right.

557
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,962
All done.

558
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,666
"A list to get men"?

559
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,136
Yes. It's Mom's secret technique.

560
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,370
Secret technique? Like Pokémon?

561
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,938
-Tech Machine Mom!
-Huh?

562
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,775
One: Pretend to get drunk
after one and a half drinks.

563
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,909
Exactly. Like this!

564
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,779
"Oh, I think I'm drunk!"

565
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,081
This is a person. A hot guy.

566
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,283
Two: Pretend the train is full.

567
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,119
-Rumble, rumble…
-No need to demonstrate.

568
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,255
-Pretend it's crowded, and lean on him.
-Exactly.

569
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,489
Tip Number Three:

570
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,792
Say, "I forgot my gloves,
my hands are cold!"

571
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,361
And put your hands into his pockets.

572
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,862
Barf. Do I not have my own pockets?

573
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,497
It doesn't matter!

574
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,635
Four: Don't cry, but pretend to cry.

575
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,371
-Mom, how many of these are there?
-Sixty-three.

576
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,741
I didn't write these,
but don't forget the basics.

577
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,543
If the boy says something,

578
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,812
"Wow! Really?

579
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,747
I can't believe it!"

580
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,316
Exaggerated reactions. And smile!

581
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,518
And if you get Italian,
get tiramisu for dessert.

582
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,021
Tiramisu and strawberries are
a cute girl's food!

583
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,155
What era are you in, Mom?

584
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,057
That's Showa. Not even Heisei.

585
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,525
So far from Reiwa.

586
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,594
You poor thing.

587
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,497
Did this help you get boys?
You cunning woman.

588
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,667
You asked what to do for a first date.

589
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,036
That's why I dug up my memories…

590
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,805
No, this is too much work!

591
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,507
If I was Suzu Hirose,

592
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,442
I would just have to stand there.

593
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,046
Too bad, you're not Suzu Hirose.

594
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,682
If I was Haruka Igawa, I'd just sit there.

595
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,684
Mom.

596
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,919
You're sitting like an old man.

597
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,722
Oh, god!

598
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,158
But would Doctor Wataru

599
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,293
like this sort of thing?

600
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,598
All men love cute girls. Did you know?

601
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,734
When they took a survey
to ask everybody's type,

602
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,203
girls' types changed with their age.

603
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,939
They looked for traits like nice, cool,

604
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,609
and reliable.

605
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,445
But all men, from preschool to
elementary to middle

606
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,381
to high school to college to
working men and old men,

607
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,317
they all answer, "A cute girl!"

608
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,019
-Are they stupid?
-In a way.

609
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,721
Oh, you just called him

610
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,422
"Doctor Wataru."

611
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,057
You're already on a first name basis?

612
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,659
What a development!

613
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,028
No. Wataru's his last name.

614
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,997
His name's Shuichi Wataru.

615
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,666
I see. That's why everyone calls him
Doctor Wataru.

616
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,935
Oh, he said to say hello.

617
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,904
I didn't know you went to
that chiropractic.

618
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,605
Yes, actually.

619
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,075
Did he mention me at all?

620
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,277
Just to say hello.

621
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,778
That's it?

622
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,547
Also, he was worried about
your fifties shoulder.

623
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,118
I'm in my forties!

624
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,972
Woohoo!

625
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,841
Alright. It's your professor's turn.

626
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:24,943
"Daitokai!"

627
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,578
-Alright!
-Professor, that's so old!

628
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,381
You have to learn about the old times.

629
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,055
-Where are you going?
-Bathroom.

630
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,792
Sora Minase?

631
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,329
Are you leaving?

632
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,966
You have to participate
in the seminar parties.

633
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,234
"Cherish harmony among people."

634
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,603
Trademarked by Prince Shōtoku!

635
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,306
-That was Confucius.
-Oh, really?

636
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,442
You're leaving?

637
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,210
I stayed for 30 minutes. I'm good.

638
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,045
I want to go home too!

639
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,914
-I'm bad at singing.
-You're right.

640
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,449
And they make you sing Kenshi Yonezu.

641
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,517
I want to sing anime songs!

642
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,289
Don't tell anyone I'm an <i>otaku!</i>

643
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,494
I'm not flirting with her.

644
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,395
Sure.

645
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,999
Apparently, when I'm with girls,

646
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,501
it looks like I'm trying to seduce them.

647
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,138
Maybe it's this hand. It's too close.

648
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,639
Oh.

649
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,309
Listen.

650
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,446
It's hard for me to talk

651
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,447
with those eyes.

652
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,250
What is it? I want to go home.

653
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,919
-To watch <i>Kaguya-sama.</i>
-Did you watch Chika Dance?

654
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,921
They say they drew 845 key frames!

655
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,891
The movements were insane!
The way her skirt flowed was

656
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,060
so smooth…

657
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,263
You're already done peeing?

658
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,798
It was all occupied.

659
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,300
Maybe something's happening inside.

660
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,603
Dang! That's totally possible.

661
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,905
Whatever. I'll sing one more song.

662
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,775
-Can you put in "USA" for me?
-Got it!

663
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,843
-I'll be going now.
-Thanks! Hey, wait!

664
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,278
Wait, wait, wait!

665
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,247
Look at this.

666
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,682
-What is it?
-It's the plot.

667
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,618
I wrote a story for a manga.

668
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,454
I said I'm not interested.
You're annoying me.

669
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,923
I like reading manga.
I don't want to draw it.

670
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,428
Did she really call me

671
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,164
annoying?

672
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,739
It's a story about a place
that's not here.

673
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,809
It's about a time that's not now.

674
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,179
It's about searching for

675
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,681
freedom in a place not here,
a time not now.

676
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,583
Please look at it.

677
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,489
A time, a place, a time period.

678
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,057
A fictional world.

679
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,327
But such a world once existed.

680
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,197
And the government issues
a story prohibition order.

681
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,533
-A story prohibition order?
-Yes.

682
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,470
Because stories can

683
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,138
tempt hearts,

684
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,639
and tempt people.

685
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,709
They can move human hearts
more than any speech or lecture,

686
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,411
and influence them.

687
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,413
And then?

688
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,252
A boy meets a girl,

689
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,654
and the two break the law

690
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,256
to start creating stories.

691
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,892
Because that is their dream.

692
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,965
STORY

693
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,373
THE TWO DID NOT YET REALIZE
THEY WERE CREATING A STORY

694
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,814
If you can write such beautiful stories,

695
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,182
why hide it?

696
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,353
Because only <i>otakus</i> write manga?

697
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,788
Why sing Kenshi Yonezu?

698
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,090
Sing "Japari Park" instead!

699
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,826
Because it's lame.

700
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,029
Aiming for a series on <i>Jump,</i>

701
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,898
and wanting to make it an anime?

702
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,133
They'd just laugh at me.

703
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,669
That's cringey.

704
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,105
It's not my character.

705
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,009
And if I fail, it would be so pathetic.

706
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,777
And I'll fail for sure.

707
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,215
So…

708
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,250
You're actually a coward.

709
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,853
What?

710
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,056
You're the same as me.

711
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:35,593
What?

712
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,166
I'm sorry. I don't have the time
to draw manga.

713
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,367
I'm busy.

714
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,073
What are you busy about?

715
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,543
Like playing games, watching anime,
reading light novels?

716
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,379
-Oh, collecting merch?
-A date. I have a date.

717
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,548
No way.

718
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,184
You have a boyfriend?

719
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,453
I'm going to soon.

720
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,591
This one? Or this one?

721
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,893
That one's cute too. Which is better?

722
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,195
Let's see. Which one is better…

723
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,498
Oh, she's home!

724
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,866
She has to try it on herself.

725
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,270
Huh? Why is she ringing the doorbell?

726
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,039
Did she forget her keys?

727
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:25,776
Huh?

728
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,079
The Early Spring 100 Books Fair.

729
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,213
We have a mockup for

730
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,415
the new cover of <i>The Perfect Date.</i>

731
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,551
I emailed you to tell you I'd drop by.

732
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,753
You replied and said okay.

733
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,688
I forgot.

734
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,591
Oh, please don't bother.

735
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,127
-I have my own.
-This is for me.

736
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,532
Ms. Aoi, do you cook?

737
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,335
I can only boil water.

738
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,570
I brew coffee.

739
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,239
I wait two minutes and 47 seconds
for cup noodles.

740
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,407
That's the best time.

741
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,210
I didn't know that.

742
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,045
You want to try?

743
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,847
I have curry noodles.

744
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,715
I'll have some.

745
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,184
I thought you'd say no.

746
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,020
I didn't have time for lunch.

747
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,489
PAUSE, CANCEL

748
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,723
Oh?

749
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,294
Just now, you called me Ms. Aoi.

750
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,962
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,565
I was talking to Ms. Matsuyama
and she called you that.

752
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,401
It's fine.

753
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,636
"Ms. Minase" is kind of hard to say.

754
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,638
The 'miz' and 'se' is tricky to say.

755
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,708
Oh, you mentioned the other day….

756
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,143
Wait. Ten more seconds!

757
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:35,680
Alright.

758
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,556
-You're right. It's good.
-Right?

759
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,658
It's my original recipe.

760
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,195
Oh, Ms. Aoi.

761
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,731
The romance with the chiropractor
you mentioned…

762
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,966
-It's over.
-What?

763
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,036
It ended before it even started.
I'm not writing it.

764
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,606
I see. That was fast.

765
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,141
Unexpectedly.

766
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,448
-What is that?
-It's from Zozotown.

767
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,982
I'll return what I don't need.

768
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,186
Oh, it's not mine. It's for my daughter.

769
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,021
Oh, I see.

770
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,690
It did look a little young for you.

771
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,128
My daughter's going on her
first ever date.

772
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,530
Your <i>otaku</i> daughter?

773
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,165
Is it her imagination?

774
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,301
Not imaginary. It's real.

775
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,503
Excuse me.

776
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,171
Ouch.

777
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,874
Ms. Aoi?

778
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,577
Just checking. Yes, it's reality.

779
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,147
Her date is with

780
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,949
the chiropractor.

781
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,284
The one I thought was cute.

782
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,086
Oh, I see.

783
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,623
It's very sad.

784
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,127
Even if I love like back then,

785
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,095
I'm not the same me.

786
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,363
I've gotten older.

787
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,698
Not at all.

788
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,467
You're still very beautiful.

789
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,537
Wow, the model answer!

790
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,805
That's not what I…

791
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,407
It's because you work for me.

792
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,409
Just because you're my editor.

793
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,512
That's actually quite cruel, you know?

794
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,484
I want to hear your honest thoughts.

795
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,053
You know,

796
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,156
maybe…

797
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,527
Maybe no one sees me as a woman anymore.

798
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

799
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,371
I didn't mean to say something
so pathetic.

800
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,507
And in front of you.

801
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,576
I'm sorry.

802
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,312
<i>Tip Number Four: Pretending to cry.</i>

803
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,714
<i>Mom was testing to see</i>

804
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,651
<i>if she still possessed her divine powers.</i>

805
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,853
<i>If her romance tricks she honed back then</i>

806
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,822
<i>would still work on men.</i>

807
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,473
Wait a minute!

808
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,580
What are you doing to someone else's man?

809
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,516
Who is this person?

810
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,185
She was loitering
in front of our building.

811
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,320
I asked her what she was doing,
and she said,

812
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,221
"I'm a stalker.

813
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,057
"I'm the best stalker there is.
I'm on my 24-hour shift.

814
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,026
I stalk Soseki Tachibana of Saneisha."

815
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,762
She was funny, so I let her in.

816
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,063
How is that funny?

817
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,467
So we stayed quiet and watched you guys.

818
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,969
We were watching closely. But…

819
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,306
-I couldn't just watch this happen!
-You've got it all wrong.

820
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,975
I was just testing what would happen
if I cried.

821
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,310
You were testing me?

822
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,015
You too, Soseki!

823
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,117
Why would you enter some woman's house?

824
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,218
Once you've entered,

825
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:38,289
any woman would fall in love with you!

826
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,723
That's not true at all.

827
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,826
Hey. You've got it all wrong!

828
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,429
Let me explain myself.

829
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,464
Mom, show them that thing!

830
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,867
The list with 63 tips.
That was Number Four.

831
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,069
Right. Wait a second.

832
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,039
Oh.

833
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,642
Here it is!

834
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,646
See? I was just trying this.

835
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,682
Sally, will you just trust me already?

836
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,917
-Sally?
-Sally?

837
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,285
I'm Saori, so it's Sally.

838
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,621
It's not some woman's house.
She's just a novelist.

839
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,490
This is the home of Ms. Minase.
I'm her editor.

840
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,561
I know.

841
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,265
I know that! But!

842
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,833
I was tracking your movements.

843
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,101
You took the Hanzomon Line,

844
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,636
transferred to the Namboku Line,

845
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,139
then you entered this building,

846
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,408
then you didn't move at all.

847
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,510
That's why I got worried!

848
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,347
Are you okay?

849
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,448
I can't…

850
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,583
-I can't breathe.
-She's hyperventilating.

851
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,318
Do you have a bag?

852
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,654
That's been proven to be a bad treatment.

853
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,489
Just relax.

854
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,890
Calm down.

855
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,892
Calm down. Breathe out.

856
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,561
Mom gets this sometimes.

857
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,996
Like when she can't write.

858
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,532
Calm down, okay?

859
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,134
AZUMA

860
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,570
FULL BLADE

861
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,152
I knew it. I'm bad.

862
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,591
I can't do it!

863
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,976
I can't see the stars in Tokyo.

864
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,333
So pretty.

865
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:06,003
Are you awake?

866
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,540
This has a relaxing effect.

867
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:12,976
I fell asleep?

868
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:14,878
Soseki said

869
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,181
you have medication you usually take.

870
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,950
You took it and got sleepy.

871
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,085
So you slept here.

872
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,588
I see.

873
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,325
I made some lemonade.

874
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,860
You want some?

875
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,163
Thank you.

876
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,343
It's delicious.

877
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,649
-Where's Soseki?
-Oh, Soseki?

878
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,119
Soseki had to work.
He's back at the office.

879
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,198
What?

880
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,167
Hey.

881
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,237
Soseki isn't the one that's making
you a mess.

882
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,272
Love is.

883
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,311
Has Soseki ever done

884
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,679
anything to hurt you?

885
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,724
I get worried for no reason.

886
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,229
We live together,

887
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,232
but even then.

888
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,437
I worry because I'm not with him
all the time.

889
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,642
I got hired at Saneisha.

890
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,044
Because I wanted to be near him longer.

891
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,547
Even then…

892
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,485
Just watching him talk and laugh with

893
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,621
female coworkers drives me mad.

894
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,127
It's like someone is

895
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:16,533
wringing my heart like a rag.

896
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,107
I'm so stupid!

897
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,430
Soseki said

898
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,533
he'd make your favorite stew tonight.

899
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:53,670
Really?

900
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:55,873
Yeah.

901
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:07,417
<i>Sally's about the same age as me.</i>

902
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,553
<i>Honestly, it was moving.</i>

903
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,256
<i>Maybe romance is a war.</i>

904
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,791
<i>For me, it's an encounter with an unknown.</i>

905
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,328
I'll work hard, Mr. Elephant!
Sora Minase is

906
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,097
taking her first adult step!

907
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,272
Wow. Perfect.

908
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,374
Your mom has great taste.

909
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,509
True. But I picked too.

910
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,278
We picked together.

911
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,948
You're the cutest you've ever been!

912
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,117
Now, and when you were born.

913
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:43,287
Don't say things like that, Mom.
I'm not a baby anymore.

914
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,187
Roger that.

915
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,227
I wish you the best of luck.

916
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,996
Thank you, ma'am.

917
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,874
Doctor Wataru!

918
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,359
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE BEHIND THE SCENES
OF <i>DATE MY DAUGHTER!</i>

919
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,393
Now.

920
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,928
What the hell? That's it?

921
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,230
Mom, language. You're too old to swear.

922
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,233
-What the hell? That's it?
-Mom, you're young.

923
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,534
MOM, YOU'RE YOUNG

924
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,903
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry.

925
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,990
THE NOODLES…

926
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:31,561
THE NOODLES WON'T COME APART

927
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,532
THE TRASH WON'T…

928
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,870
THE TRASH WON'T GO IN!

929
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,040
A FAIL

930
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,409
ANOTHER FAIL

931
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,612
SO CLOSE!

932
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,848
A SUCCESS!

933
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,016
Yay!

934
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,820
<i>Did you enjoy your date?</i>

935
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,422
<i>-An arranged marriage date?</i>
<i>-He marries.</i>

936
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,756
<i>We can't go to Odaya.</i>

937
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,792
Go on a date with that childhood friend.

938
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,660
<i>I need my own love, or I can't write.</i>

939
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,129
Love is more random.

940
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,798
<i>Will that random love come true?</i>

941
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,933
Let's not get married.

942
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,834
