1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,303
Doctor Wataru!

2
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,292
<i>Nose hair.</i>

3
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,002
Nose hair?

4
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,371
Yes. Nose hair.

5
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,243
That's quite the hurdle, nose hair.

6
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,944
I may not be able to jump it.

7
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,281
Did you enjoy your date?

8
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,183
I can only remember the nose hair.

9
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,986
Plans for the next date?

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,221
My mind was on the nose hair.
I didn't ask.

11
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,293
You couldn't point out the nose hair
to him?

12
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,130
I'm certain I could never say
such a thing.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,134
Oh!

14
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,270
Was the small-clawed otter cute?

15
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,740
He was really cute.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,445
Oh, he's adorable!

17
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,080
So cold!

18
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,215
When can I see you next?

19
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,516
-Let's see.
-Tomorrow?

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,685
-I have work.
-No way!

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,089
Oh, Hikaru!

22
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:30,890
Hey.

23
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,626
Oh, this is my cousin.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,196
I tutored him back home,

25
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,897
in Kumamoto.

26
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,333
I see. Good evening.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,302
So you go to school here?

28
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,071
-Yes.
-Where?

29
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,740
Rissei Gakuin University.

30
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,809
Wow, impressive!

31
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,546
No, it was unacceptable at his home.

32
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,483
I felt guilty as his tutor.

33
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,285
His brother went to Kyushu
University pre-med from La Salle.

34
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,721
His father's a Kyushu University
med school professor.

35
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,423
Your family's very educated.

36
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,758
Well, my family is.

37
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,128
Don't sulk like that!

38
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,930
Did you need anything?

39
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,867
No, well…

40
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,802
My parents sent some stuff from home.

41
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,937
They asked me to give this to you.

42
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,974
-I'll be going, then.
-Really?

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,009
Yes. Talk about memories from back home.

44
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,378
-No, I'll head back.
-It's fine.

45
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,013
We can see each other whenever.

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,049
We see each other too much.
We need to spend some time apart.

47
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,084
Hey!

48
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,855
I'm so drunk!

49
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,025
Your parents sent you this from home?

50
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,127
Flan from a convenience store?

51
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,297
It's my favorite.

52
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,467
You're a liar, Miwa.

53
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,004
Oh, what I said before?

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,073
Half is a lie, and half is the truth.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,809
It's true that I was your tutor.

56
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,511
But a complete lie

57
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,213
that you're my cousin.

58
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,652
Let me tell you

59
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,820
a great technique for when you lie.

60
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,356
You mix in some truths.

61
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,660
Is he your top choice?

62
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,697
Well, not really. I'm assessing.

63
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,732
More like, browsing.

64
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,036
I'm trying him out.

65
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,838
So he's being returned?

66
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,809
I'm almost 30, you know?

67
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,645
You don't look it.

68
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,050
Maybe I don't look it,

69
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,618
but once I'm 30,

70
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,821
I want to get married.

71
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,190
I don't need love anymore.

72
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,026
I'm tired of working.

73
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,028
I just want to relax.

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,398
You want to relax?

75
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,534
I came to Tokyo,

76
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,870
worked hard, and wore myself out.

77
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,207
I'm emotionally tired.

78
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,845
You have a lot of girlfriends too,
right, Hikaru?

79
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,482
Yeah. Of course. Lots.

80
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,950
Right?

81
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,854
It's too much work to like
and love just one person.

82
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,890
Having fun with pretty girls
is all you need, right?

83
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,328
We have Gorgonzola Taiyaki!

84
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,231
We have <i>sanmayaki</i> with less paste,
great for those on a diet!

85
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,000
White bean, crushed bean,

86
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,002
Indian, Alien, Adrian! Just kidding.

87
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,503
Gon-chan, three <i>sanmayaki.</i>

88
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,005
Are you on a diet, Asu?

89
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,407
Oh, sorry. That's sexual harassment.

90
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,209
Asu, you've grown up into a beauty!

91
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,143
Really?

92
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,778
Can you really eat three?

93
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,179
It's for my family.

94
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,547
I see.

95
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,750
He's handsome, isn't he?

96
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,718
He really is handsome!

97
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,488
What a bummer. Only if I was younger.

98
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,291
If only I wasn't married, right?

99
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,760
And these girls over here.
What will you have?

100
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,196
Gon-chan. We're not here to eat today.

101
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,666
-What?
-We have a proposal for you.

102
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,170
No way. Is that what I think it is?

103
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,872
She's really pretty, alright?

104
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,441
A beauty! Right?
You just have to meet her.

105
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,043
Come on. At my age?

106
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,045
All you have to do is look.

107
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,112
Trust me, alright?

108
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,048
Hey, come on. No…

109
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,684
-How old?
-Twenty-six.

110
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,885
So young!

111
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,355
I'm home. Geez.

112
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,825
Mr. Toyoda from Sarashina Toyoda
talks too much.

113
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,428
His rants are as long as his soba noodles,
am I right?

114
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,397
Hey, sorry my husband talks too much!

115
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,999
Oh? You're here?

116
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,968
Oh, today was Suzuran Shopping District's
Board of Directors meeting.

117
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,003
Was my husband there?

118
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,606
Yes, he was. But he went out for drinks.

119
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,507
What?

120
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,343
Another arranged marriage date?

121
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,815
Right? Auntie Toyoda and Mrs. Kanbayashi

122
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,951
always bring photos, calling her a beauty,
but they never are!

123
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,887
They're all leftovers of the district,
divorced.

124
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,756
-Or from Suzuran Elementary…
-Hey!

125
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,725
This one's impressive.

126
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,295
She's… What was it? Miss Universal?

127
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,897
Universal's a theme park.
She's like Miss Universe!

128
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,400
I'll meet her.

129
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,634
I'll marry her!

130
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,837
What are you saying? It's for me.

131
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,805
-No, wait.
-What? Just show me.

132
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,142
Shunichiro's fine, too. He's single.

133
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,644
A May and December wedding.
Just like Cha Katō.

134
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,979
Peh!

135
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,214
She's all mine.

136
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,183
What are you saying?
You perverted old man!

137
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,084
It's for me!

138
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,586
Let go!

139
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,321
Oh!

140
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,424
Are you alright?

141
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,925
My back!

142
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,761
Are you okay?

143
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:35,862
Don't touch me!

144
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,864
Are you okay?

145
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,999
My back hurts. Ouch!

146
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,934
She's so pretty!

147
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,569
CHIROPRACTIC: TAIYOU-DO

148
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,905
How is it?

149
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,908
It's just a bruise. No need to worry.

150
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,179
Alright. All finished.

151
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,480
Help me up.

152
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,519
Huh? What?

153
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,854
It doesn't hurt.

154
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,222
-I'm glad.
-Wow.

155
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,366
-What is this?
-Nose hair extensions.

156
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,669
-What? Nose hair extensions?
-Yes.

157
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,473
-No, these are eyelash extensions…
-It's nose hair.

158
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,061
Pretty, right?

159
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,406
Wow, she's really pretty!

160
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,574
So beautiful.

161
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,479
-Prettier than you, Mom.
-What does that mean?

162
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,981
You always want to fight
against pretty women.

163
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,716
You want to decide who wins and who loses.

164
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,751
Oh yeah, she does that!

165
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,955
She was sulky for placing second
in a beauty contest in middle school.

166
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,290
I've already lost to her by age.

167
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,326
She's 26, right?

168
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,463
Wait, why am I fighting?

169
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:18,798
Whatever.

170
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,867
So you came all this way

171
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,435
to show this off?

172
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,971
No way. I'm busy, you know?

173
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,772
But you're going to meet her.

174
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,941
It's not like you can marry her,
right, Gon?

175
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,612
-Yes, I can.
-Really?

176
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,614
-I'm 90% sure.
-How are you so sure?

177
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,353
Apparently, she saw me making my <i>taiyaki.</i>

178
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,555
It was, you know…

179
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,691
<i>Love at first sight!</i>

180
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,059
<i>So she came by every day.</i>

181
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,529
<i>But she was too shy to order</i> taiyaki.

182
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,597
<i>That's why she asked Auntie Toyoda.</i>

183
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,267
I'm here because

184
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,803
if I do marry her, you're a
celebrity of sorts so…

185
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,273
-Not "of sorts."
-Make a speech for us.

186
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,375
You came to say that?

187
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,143
He came to show her off.

188
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,314
But you know, Mom.
If Gon-chan gets married,

189
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,516
we can't go to Odaya like we do now.

190
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,784
-Huh?
-What?

191
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,787
What? I mean, it's true.

192
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,024
A new wife. And she's young.

193
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,425
I bet she's the jealous type.

194
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,429
-Hey.
-Oh, sorry. But pretty people are jealous.

195
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,198
If he gets such a pretty wife,

196
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,201
and if Mom, his childhood friend,
who's old but still pretty…

197
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,938
Sora. Just call me pretty
and get to the point.

198
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,943
I'm saying that if his childhood friend
came to Odaya

199
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,811
<i>like it was her own living room,</i>

200
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,279
<i>eating yakisoba and</i> taiyaki

201
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,181
<i>and grilled mochi</i>

202
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,050
<i>and curling up in the</i> kotatsu <i>like a cat.</i>

203
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,052
She can't do that anymore!
Your new wife would hate it.

204
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,289
-I see.
-She's right.

205
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,427
But, you know,

206
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,562
if you really do get married,

207
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,731
Nako would be so happy.

208
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,869
Nako in heaven would be proud of you.

209
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,538
You think?

210
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,375
I was a good-for-nothing son.

211
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,544
I didn't see her on her deathbed.

212
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,746
It's because

213
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,415
we didn't know where you were!

214
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,783
I was traveling the world.

215
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,419
I was training in France as a pastry chef.

216
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,555
-Is that even true?
-What?

217
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,024
You want to hear my French?

218
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,095
Azabu juban. <i>Shippo made anko.</i>

219
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,663
You're so dumb.

220
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,699
It's true. I was in Paris.

221
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,469
That's why we have the Gorgonzola Taiyaki
in Odaya.

222
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,738
That was made in France.

223
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,705
Gon-chan.

224
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,807
Gorgonzola is an Italian cheese.

225
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,009
Oopsies!

226
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,778
I was all over Europe. That's why.

227
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,949
I hope I can have kids. Loads of them.

228
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,284
You want a baseball team?

229
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,222
I'd be happy if they took over the shop.

230
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,258
Odaya is really good.

231
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,160
You can't lose that.

232
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,230
It's continued since the Meiji Era.
That's amazing!

233
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,767
I thought Kenta could take over.

234
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,869
But when I asked him, he said,

235
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,004
"I couldn't!
It's gone on for four generations!

236
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,707
That's too much pressure!"

237
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,009
-Kids these days.
-Right?

238
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,178
I'm going to go check my books
at the bookstore.

239
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,881
I have a get-together
for Suzuran District.

240
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,916
Don't get sad if your books aren't piled.

241
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,118
You mean stacked. See you.

242
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,622
Oh, your right arm can go up!
So it's healed?

243
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,923
Your fifties shoulder.

244
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,325
My forties shoulder!!

245
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,397
PLOT FOR NEW SERIES

246
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,076
I've taken a look.

247
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,610
How is it?

248
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,481
Are you serious about this?

249
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,817
Why? It's good, right?

250
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,351
She wakes up, she's late, she runs

251
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,653
while holding toast,

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,288
then she bumps into a hot guy.

253
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,689
"Oh no, I'm so clumsy!" she says.

254
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,525
Then she goes to class and finds
that the hot guy is her teacher.

255
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,927
A fateful reunion.

256
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,229
Is it good?

257
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,498
Of course not!

258
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,035
I don't think I'm cut out for this
anymore.

259
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,705
I hear your annual income is 12 million
yen. Let me propose something.

260
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,874
Will you marry me?

261
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,044
What are you saying? You punched me
in the stomach the other day.

262
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,545
And how do you know my income?

263
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,648
I can't write romance novels
through interviews.

264
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,850
I need to find my own love.

265
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,687
No signs of that?

266
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,189
-None.
-You could think back on your past.

267
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,994
It was so long ago. I can't remember.

268
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,963
Not since the chiropractor?

269
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,100
-Nose hair man…
-What?

270
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,636
That's a taboo subject.

271
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,740
Mom, what about that story?

272
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,643
-Which story?
-How we can't go to Odaya.

273
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,447
That's so sad!

274
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,683
That place was my living room!
I love their <i>kotatsu.</i>

275
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,452
Why can't you go there?

276
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,754
Mom's childhood friend is getting married.

277
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,956
That's really good!

278
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,291
What?

279
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,260
Go on a date with him.

280
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,630
Bob Dylan tickets?
Those are so hard to get!

281
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,365
How? Through the power of Saneisha?

282
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,534
No. I clicked about 1,500 times.

283
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,902
Wow! Let's go, Sora!

284
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,670
No, this will be given to you

285
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,872
only if you go on a date

286
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,208
with that childhood friend.
A two in one pack.

287
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,077
ODAYA

288
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,780
What should I get?

289
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,249
-Their <i>taiyaki's</i> good, right?
-That's true.

290
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,419
Just get me whatever you're getting.

291
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,156
-Got it.
-Where's the restroom?

292
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,258
-It's over there.
-Thank you.

293
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,734
What? Why?

294
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,539
Hey, there.

295
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,810
Here you are. Enjoy.

296
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,682
Did you stalk me here?

297
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,983
No.

298
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,886
We just came here
after watching a movie around here.

299
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,989
Oh, a date?

300
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,290
In a way, yes.

301
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,758
What else would you call it?

302
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,264
I see… You saw <i>Until They Kiss.</i>

303
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,568
Let's talk <i>Chainsaw Man</i>
until she comes back.

304
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,769
Stop it, will you?

305
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,707
Is this your home?

306
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,108
No way. I work here.

307
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,110
Work. I see.

308
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,015
Hey, waitress. Two <i>taiyaki,</i> please.

309
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,383
And hurry, will you?

310
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,790
How was your date?

311
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,492
Getting along with your boyfriend?

312
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,161
It's going really well.

313
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,564
That's great.

314
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,132
We're both happy then.

315
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,635
To celebrate the joy,

316
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,403
this is for you.

317
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,039
<i>Cells at Work!</i> It's White Blood Cell!

318
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,376
I could never get Platelet.
Only White Blood Cell.

319
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,212
<i>Gachapon</i> on a date to get your character?

320
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,981
No way. I did it by myself,
on the way there.

321
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,717
Nice. I happily accept.

322
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:20,786
Oh, and this.

323
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,489
Here you are.

324
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,325
I got that too.

325
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,564
-What about your girlfriend?
-She only likes authentic stuff.

326
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,533
Like brand names.

327
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,136
I'd get sad if she asks me
how many carats that is.

328
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:40,940
I see.

329
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,042
<i>Hey, Soseki.</i>

330
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,643
Soseki?

331
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,313
Where did he go? Geez.

332
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,949
He's always off doing perverted things.

333
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,916
EQUIPMENT ROOM

334
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,153
Why won't you believe me?

335
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,788
Yesterday,

336
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,724
you went from Yotsuya to Otemachi,

337
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,359
then stopped at Jimbocho.

338
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,593
Jimbocho?

339
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,596
You know the new big bookstore there?

340
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,032
I stopped by
to see where they sell our books.

341
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,336
You didn't meet a hot girl
at the bookstore?

342
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,471
No way. I swear.

343
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,773
Jimbocho only has ugly girls.
It's not Ginza.

344
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,909
I see.

345
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,479
Hey, I'm working.

346
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,815
I'll get fired if I keep doing this.

347
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,150
I'm…

348
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,054
-Am I getting in your way, Soseki?
-It's not like that.

349
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,690
I will set aside time for you, Sally.

350
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,626
-I always do, right?
-Why…?

351
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,931
Why do you always react
like you're a kid in trouble?

352
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,667
Like a kid who has to submit his homework.

353
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,037
I want you to say, of your own accord,

354
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,672
"I want to be with you more!"

355
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,207
"I want to see your face more!"

356
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,477
Things like that.
Things like, "I want you!"

357
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,580
We're at work.

358
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,648
It's not our home or a love hotel.

359
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,852
What do you want from me?

360
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,757
Alright! I wanted to go to this!

361
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,426
No. I'm not giving you two. Just one.

362
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,727
The other one is for me.

363
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,329
We're going together.

364
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,699
Why do I have to go on a date with you?

365
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,001
Just give me two. I'll go with Takashi
from the clock shop.

366
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,669
I can't.

367
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,838
I can't separate these two.
It's a two-in-one set.

368
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,107
What is she on about?

369
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,277
When is that? Show me.

370
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,279
This Friday?

371
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,680
You're not invited, Dad.

372
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,783
Kenta and I will take care of the shop.

373
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:31,817
-You should go.
-What?

374
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,786
Go on a date with Aoi.

375
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,921
Why?

376
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,124
Don't go see Bob Dylan with two dudes!

377
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,093
You'll make Dylan cry.

378
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,767
Shunichiro, what have you been doing?

379
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,171
A dating app.

380
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,138
SEARCHING FOR CONNECTIONS…

381
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,749
<i>It's upside down.</i>

382
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,159
<i>The cars illuminated with tail lights</i>

383
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,462
<i>look like tropical fish in an aquarium.</i>

384
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,207
<i>The elementary school I went to.</i>

385
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,076
<i>The school closed down</i>
<i>due to a declining birthrate.</i>

386
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,053
One, two, three…

387
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,690
Four!

388
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,233
FORMER SUZURAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
DEMOLITION NOTICE

389
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,134
<i>It's going away?</i>

390
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,503
<i>This school?</i>

391
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,726
This place is cute, right?

392
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,927
Really?

393
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,966
MOM

394
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,301
Oh, sorry.

395
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,271
How's your asthma?

396
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,741
<i>It's calmed down these days.</i>

397
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,644
You're calling about
the family gathering, right?

398
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,146
I think I can make it the day before.

399
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,416
<i>Oh, about that.</i>

400
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,853
<i>You don't need to come for that.</i>

401
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,025
What? Why?

402
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,994
<i>All our relatives will be there.</i>

403
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,298
<i>Like Brother Hideo and Yuko from Fukuoka.</i>

404
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,501
Yeah, haven't seen them for years.

405
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,303
<i>It's been five years.</i>

406
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,840
<i>They don't know where you went</i>
<i>for college.</i>

407
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,345
<i>We'd talk about those things</i>
<i>at these events.</i>

408
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,982
<i>Dad wouldn't like it.</i>

409
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,585
<i>Your brother Hitoshi</i>

410
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,288
<i>got into La Salle last year.</i>
<i>So it's just you.</i>

411
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,424
<i>Dad doesn't know</i>

412
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,360
<i>how to tell everyone that</i>

413
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,662
<i>you didn't go to pre-med.</i>

414
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,831
<i>You should just stop</i>

415
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,200
<i>writing those silly cartoons of yours…</i>

416
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,484
<i>Hello?</i>

417
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,752
Sorry for hanging up.

418
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,888
It works out for me. I was busy anyway.

419
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,292
Mom.

420
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,762
Take care of yourself, alright?

421
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,444
<i>He plays the young Chris Matsumura…</i>

422
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,316
Come in.

423
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,085
What's wrong?

424
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,695
I'm going to sleep.

425
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,497
Sure, okay.

426
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,835
They're going to demolish
Suzuran Elementary?

427
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,905
They're building a condo.

428
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,310
Right. They closed that school

429
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,211
six years after you graduated.

430
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,819
I guess that

431
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,655
things you love
never stay in their original form

432
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,458
forever.

433
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,628
You loved your elementary school?

434
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,530
Well, that's good.

435
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,832
So, Mom.

436
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,234
Thank you.

437
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,769
Why?

438
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,172
Thanks for letting us live here

439
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,641
while Zojirushi is here.

440
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,745
That Zojirushi might

441
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,147
one day disappear too.

442
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,050
That's true.

443
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,287
Anything that exists will one day go away.

444
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,156
In that case,

445
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,559
I want to cherish them while I still can.

446
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,794
See them while I still can.

447
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,596
Touch them when I still can!

448
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,167
Hey, are you drunk?

449
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,071
You were watching <i>Exit,</i> right?

450
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,040
Want to watch? Kanechika's so cool!

451
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,308
Are you done with work?

452
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,211
Isn't your <i>Little Beauty</i> deadline
for <i>Mom's Helper Magazine</i> today?

453
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,683
Can't someone just give me money?

454
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,985
-I just want to have fun and live!
-Hey.

455
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,424
Mom.

456
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,694
Do you do work you don't like for me?

457
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,197
Writing looks like a hard job.

458
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,136
No, I don't.

459
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,405
I'm very grateful for you.

460
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,777
If you weren't here, I would've quit
this hard job

461
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,678
years ago.

462
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,114
A cocktail waitress, maybe?

463
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,184
I'd be bad at it.
I'm not attentive enough.

464
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,585
I would've just starved.

465
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,322
I'm so glad you're here.

466
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,226
I worked hard because of you.

467
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,198
Doing something for others,

468
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,801
doing something for someone,

469
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,936
is a happy and beautiful thing.

470
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,641
There's a limit to how hard
you can work for yourself.

471
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,477
That's what I think.

472
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,215
Mom.

473
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,653
That was really beautiful.
You could use that later.

474
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,855
Maybe you should write it down.

475
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,723
You're right. Notes app!

476
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:28,133
You went to Suzuran Elementary too, right?

477
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,203
Yup. I'm your <i>senpai.</i>

478
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,105
I see.

479
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,776
You were an elementary school kid too.

480
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,879
Such a time existed?

481
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,881
Of course it did!

482
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,853
Thinking about you in elementary school

483
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,821
kind of makes me cry.

484
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,359
You as a little girl!

485
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,696
Hey, you!

486
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,664
That's too much limoncello for you!

487
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,205
Mom. What kind of kid were you?

488
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,543
I was always forgetting things at home.

489
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,616
Ouch! Why did you do that?

490
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,419
ODAYA

491
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,358
It got cold.

492
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,728
Miss, your yakisoba will get cold too.

493
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,734
I'd love it if you ate it warm.

494
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,802
It tastes better that way.

495
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,071
I don't

496
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,408
actually want yakisoba.

497
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,215
I was just tracking his phone.

498
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,050
He got on the Namboku Line,

499
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,019
so maybe he'd get off here again.

500
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,353
I'm ambushing him.

501
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,924
But the GPS is acting funky.

502
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,860
Let me see.

503
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,464
Let's see.

504
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,335
Turn off the cellular data.

505
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,540
-Oh. Here it is.
-Wow!

506
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,878
He's all the way in Toda.

507
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,881
I came here for nothing.

508
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,218
It may have been nothing,
but eat up, okay?

509
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,555
Our yakisoba's really good.

510
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,325
ODAYA

511
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,532
-It's really good.
-Right?

512
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,534
The tempura bits especially.

513
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,504
They're from the tempura shop over there.

514
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,210
-I see.
-Yeah.

515
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,614
This place Odaya, it's famous, right?

516
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,618
I'm the third generation owner.

517
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,154
I came in here

518
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,857
to treat myself

519
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,727
after a sad day.

520
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,398
Oh? What happened?

521
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,141
This may be on the final exam.

522
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,411
Maybe, maybe not.

523
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,812
Which is it?

524
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,447
-Which do you want?
-We can pick?

525
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,415
No way.

526
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,084
In that case, let's study at my place.

527
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,320
-Good idea.
-Let's split the work up.

528
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,088
But no one took good notes.

529
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,757
-I did.
-Seriously?

530
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,925
You did! Impressive!

531
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,127
I don't even have a notebook.

532
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,063
You're the worst!

533
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,865
That's really bad, dude.

534
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:47,899
Really bad.

535
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,100
Excuse me.

536
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,302
What is it?

537
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,171
I want to apologize to you.

538
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,541
Sorry. I'll be back.

539
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,475
What's going on?

540
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,277
I'll be done in two seconds.

541
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,722
What is it?

542
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,895
Last night, finally,

543
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,899
we got in a fight about this GPS tracking.

544
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,637
We've been dating for two years now.

545
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,571
I see.

546
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,276
It's so yummy.

547
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,781
Perhaps you shouldn't

548
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,750
cry, eat, and talk at the same time.

549
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,354
Just pick one.

550
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,423
It might be easier.

551
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,396
You know,

552
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,833
I don't have anything.

553
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,470
I only have love to give.

554
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,340
I came to Tokyo from Aomori
to chase after a guy.

555
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,374
A Tsugaru accent?

556
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,377
But that man ran away from me.

557
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,513
Oh, I see.

558
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,248
After that,

559
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,684
Soseki took me in.

560
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,152
I didn't have anywhere to go.

561
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,420
That's why I turned into

562
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,922
this stalker.

563
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,592
If I could, I would follow him
around all day.

564
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,562
Do you have work?

565
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,832
I started a part-time job
just to follow him,

566
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,235
but I'm probably gonna get fired-dabyon.

567
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,270
"Dabyon?"

568
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,072
I don't even know

569
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,575
if I love him anymore.

570
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,046
I'm just obsessed with being
attached to him.

571
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,182
She's back in her Tokyo accent.

572
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,085
I really hate myself.

573
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,456
You want some <i>kuzukiri?</i>

574
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,659
Soseki Natsume said the best way
to cheer up women is with sweets.

575
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,962
Soseki!

576
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,798
Oh, no, you've got it wrong!

577
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:03,034
I'm talking about the writer!
Wait, he didn't say that.

578
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,937
Was it Osamu Dazai? No…

579
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,107
Some smart person said it, right?

580
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,576
I'm a <i>menhera.</i>

581
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,244
These are my meds.

582
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,879
They're called Lyricas. Do you know it?

583
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,816
No, I don't. <i>"Menhera"?</i>

584
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,552
Menmen?

585
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,088
Tantanmen? No, that's wrong.

586
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,462
I love dad jokes.

587
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,398
I guess

588
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,667
there are people

589
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:39,070
with no knowledge of <i>menhera</i>
or Lyricas in this world.

590
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,471
Even at that age.

591
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,107
Are you dissing me?

592
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,110
I'm not dissing you.

593
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,748
You know what "dissing" means?

594
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,852
You're inconsistent in your knowledge
of slang!

595
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,989
No, no.

596
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,160
I'll bring water for your medication.

597
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,462
-No need.
-What?

598
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,032
I feel calm

599
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,034
after talking to you.

600
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:11,803
Oh, really?

601
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,505
I was able to help?

602
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,912
Will you embrace me?

603
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,414
What?

604
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,552
Please be my anti-anxiety medication.

605
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:32,590
No.

606
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,093
-You don't want to?
-No.

607
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,863
Just a light one.

608
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:41,799
Okay.

609
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,403
I guess I could do a light one.

610
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,088
What the hell?

611
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,557
-A glass ball?
-Yes.

612
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,761
It rolled into a drain.

613
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:11,996
I couldn't reach it.

614
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,232
Which glass ball?

615
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,603
Oh, wait! I remember! The one I gave you

616
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,271
with White Blood Cell.

617
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,811
But you're so honest.
That was just a tiny thing.

618
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,148
I could see the city upside down.

619
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,183
It was fun.

620
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,089
Then pay for my drink here.

621
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,660
-Sure.
-Really?

622
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,063
I liked seeing the upside down city.

623
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,433
-It felt new.
-Alright!

624
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,036
How is it going with your boyfriend?

625
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,341
The date. It went well, right?

626
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,645
I lied.

627
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:03,815
Nose hair.

628
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,817
-Nose hair?
-His nose hair was out.

629
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,855
-And then?
-That's it.

630
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,926
-That's all. The end.
-No way!

631
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,694
-Isn't that too hasty?
-Because…

632
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,497
Romance is to desire beautiful things.

633
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,938
-Who said that? Shakespeare?
-Me.

634
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,074
You can write too?

635
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,944
-Can you write a manga story?
-I can't write! It's my mom.

636
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,412
Your mother?

637
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,116
What does your mom do?

638
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,721
She's a writer.

639
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,125
Could she be Aoi Minase?

640
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,459
You know her?

641
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,463
Everyone knows her! Seriously?

642
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,165
That's so cool.

643
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,801
My mom is. I'm nobody.

644
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,037
What does your dad do?

645
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,838
I don't know.

646
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,209
I don't have a dad.
My mom had me on her own.

647
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:07,945
That's so cool!

648
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,781
You're a bit strange.

649
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,849
You are too!

650
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,485
You end a romance over some nose hair?

651
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,320
You're too narrow-minded.

652
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,356
Maybe he looked in the mirror at home

653
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,725
and went, "I've really messed up!"

654
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,693
Right?

655
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,896
Or, he grew it out as a joke.

656
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,832
No way.

657
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,102
Love is more random than you think.

658
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,171
Anything can spark it.

659
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,377
Oh, I was plagiarizing Shakespeare there.

660
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,614
I see.

661
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,384
Maybe a random love could happen to Mom.

662
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,686
Your mom, huh?

663
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,522
Mom's on a date today.
She's seeing Bob Dylan

664
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,157
with a childhood friend.

665
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,160
-You want more coffee?
-Yes, please.

666
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,265
Who's Bob Dylan?

667
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,235
What? You know Aoi Minase
but not Bob Dylan?

668
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,536
Your knowledge is skewed?

669
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,804
What?

670
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:12,977
That's Bob Dylan.

671
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,387
Wow! You can sing it!

672
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,424
I could sing it in French too.

673
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,692
No need for that.

674
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,496
He was so good! Dylan!

675
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,964
Gon-chan!

676
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,632
You're drunk.

677
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,068
Where are you headed?

678
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,070
Let's get more drinks.

679
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,672
You have work tomorrow, right?

680
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,774
Let's go home then. This way.

681
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:45,610
-Gon-chan.
-Yeah?

682
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,412
-This way.
-What? Where are we going?

683
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,114
SLOW DOWN!

684
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:54,585
Wow, brings me back!

685
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,787
They're building condos here.

686
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,489
Sora told me the other day.

687
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,057
Seriously?

688
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,026
See, it's written here.

689
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:02,960
You're right.

690
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,062
They're starting demolition
on February 8th.

691
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,000
They're taking it down next week?

692
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,436
It's going to go away.

693
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,372
Our elementary school.

694
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,724
This way! Come!

695
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,560
We'll get in trouble!

696
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,761
We'll be fine.

697
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,300
We played

698
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,337
"Pineapple" here a lot.

699
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,771
Hey, Gon-chan.

700
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,007
You saved me here once, remember?

701
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,375
What?

702
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,278
I was being bullied by
an upperclassman girl.

703
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,046
She was blocking my way.

704
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:33,084
FIRE EXTINGUISHER

705
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,822
REMIND EACHOTHER TO WASH HANDS AND MOUTH

706
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,857
Hey!

707
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,526
Get out of the way.
The stew will get cold.

708
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,295
It's my favorite.

709
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,331
Don't bully her just because she's cute.

710
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,837
You're cuter than her, you know?

711
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,108
So cool!

712
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,943
Hey. Let's carry this.

713
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,247
-Let's speed it up!
-What?

714
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,249
Push!

715
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,318
Why are we running?

716
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,619
What? Look!

717
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,488
There's always been ghosts

718
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,590
behind the west exit bathroom!

719
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,060
The blue hand and the red hand!

720
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,301
I haven't played like that in a long time.

721
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,738
My box was always filled
with love letters.

722
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,907
On Valentine's Day, they wouldn't
even fit in my box.

723
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,244
On that day,
I would borrow my friend's box.

724
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,179
Valentine's was snack day!

725
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,882
When I went to Odaya,
there was so much chocolate.

726
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,417
My name started with O,

727
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,186
so my class number was usually three.
I'd be around here.

728
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,861
Class number three,

729
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,597
Gonji Oda. Nicknamed Gon-chan.

730
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,068
Yes?

731
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,805
Let's not become a wife.

732
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,942
<i>Mom messed up her line</i>

733
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,944
<i>at the most crucial moment.</i>

734
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,995
Let's not become a wife.

735
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,533
<i>Mom messed up her line</i>

736
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,402
<i>at the most crucial moment.</i>

737
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:34,739
Um, well…

738
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,009
Wait, you're not becoming a wife.

739
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,579
You're the one getting a wife.

740
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:42,646
Aoi.

741
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,515
Yeah?

742
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,884
I'm sorry.

743
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,287
Well, you know, I…

744
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,223
<i>Gon-chan was ruthless.</i>

745
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,991
<i>In these situations,</i>

746
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,927
<i>the man should leave the space</i>
<i>for the woman to say</i>

747
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,397
<i>"Come on, it was just a joke!"</i>

748
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,165
<i>That's what a real man does.</i>

749
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:02,967
<i>But Gon-chan was</i>

750
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,236
<i>still an elementary school kid.</i>

751
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,337
I already

752
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,607
met with Aoba.

753
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,845
So you already had the marriage date?

754
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,681
I already asked
Auntie Toyoda to move forward.

755
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,087
So…

756
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,327
I can't return your feelings. I'm sorry!

757
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,999
<i>Through a strange turn of events,</i>

758
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,134
<i>it was as if Mom was rejected</i>

759
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,669
<i>beyond any doubt.</i>

760
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,039
<i>As if she confessed her long-lasting love</i>
<i>and was rejected.</i>

761
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,308
<i>The casual line uttered by Mom,</i>

762
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,677
<i>called upon by the sweet night breeze,</i>

763
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,747
<i>grew into an irreparable ordeal</i>
<i>of confessing one's feelings</i>

764
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,450
<i>and was returned ruthlessly</i>

765
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,052
<i>by the cliché line for lost love,</i>
<i>"I'm sorry."</i>

766
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,654
<i>And she fell</i>

767
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,690
<i>into a deep, deep, hole</i>
<i>reaching the mantle of the Earth.</i>

768
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,694
Here's the coated paper.

769
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,496
Here's the mermaid paper.

770
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,467
Here's the leather-like paper.
These are a bit pricey.

771
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,937
I can't tell the difference.

772
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,974
One's glossy, one's rough,

773
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,309
and one's sizzling.

774
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,545
-Sizzling?
-Feel it.

775
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,781
Excuse me.

776
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,918
Sizzle, sizzle.

777
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,221
Anything's fine.

778
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,626
-Are you alright, Ms. Aoi?
-I'm not.

779
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,127
I got dumped.

780
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,532
I do feel a little responsible for that.

781
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,901
But I suffered for two hours

782
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,103
clicking the same button.

783
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,339
-All for those Bob Dylan tickets…
-Why?

784
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,676
Why, why, why, why?

785
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,780
Why do I have to get rejected
by that monkey?

786
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,084
-He's a monkey?
-Yes, he is!

787
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,119
He isn't bad-looking, of course.

788
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,822
He was the star of the local
basketball team since elementary school.

789
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,892
All the girls cheered him on
in the sports contests.

790
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,961
But inside that head, he's just a monkey.

791
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,864
I went to the same cram school as him.

792
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,167
Gon-chan cried because he didn't get
the crane-turtle math at all!

793
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,136
He would add a bunny to the mix!

794
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,438
No one would solve that!

795
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,541
A crane and a turtle is too much.
Now, a bunny?

796
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,809
I'm glad the new member
wasn't a centipede.

797
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,345
He got bored of multiplication
after the fives.

798
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,047
He should've kept at that.

799
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,982
He'd get Valentine's chocolates, right?

800
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,817
He'd invite all his guy friends over

801
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,986
and eat them all up as a group!

802
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,887
Can you believe it?

803
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,056
They don't have an ounce of sensitivity.

804
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,926
He'd invite boys over
who didn't get any chocolates.

805
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,328
He'd tell them, "Eat up!"
And they'd be like,

806
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,996
"Why are we getting leftovers?"

807
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,698
And get even sadder.

808
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,533
But they're kids after all,

809
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,303
so they give in to how good
the chocolates are.

810
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,805
Eventually they'd start eating
<i>taiyaki</i> and yakisoba.

811
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,341
And his mom would make so much!

812
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,210
Of course, I would be eating
with them, but…

813
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,112
What are you saying, Ms. Aoi?

814
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,417
I'm upset! I'm so upset!

815
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,320
I got rejected by a monkey!

816
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,721
We're back to the start.

817
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,524
I didn't say I liked him.

818
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,826
I didn't say that at all. Not even a hint!

819
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,729
I just said,
"What if you don't get married?"

820
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,331
Because then, I can't go to Odaya.

821
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,166
Odaya's our living room.

822
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,603
To be honest, I don't actually like this
magazine cover house that much!

823
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,404
I just copied Ira Ishida.

824
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,374
These white walls that wash away
any shadow! It's for photo shoots!

825
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,643
I don't even get that many interviews
these days…

826
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,979
This room exists only to hide my wrinkles!

827
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,046
Like laugh lines?

828
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,415
Yes, exactly!

829
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,618
You're knowledgeable for a boy!

830
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,886
Do you do anything to remove them?

831
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,455
I just put on Nivea cream.

832
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,758
What were we talking about?

833
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:48,792
Monkeys.

834
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,329
Right! So I just don't like

835
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,064
that I can't go to Odaya.

836
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,433
It's not like I ever liked him
in the slightest!

837
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,202
Is that true?

838
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,971
Maybe you said that
because you liked him a little bit.

839
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,210
Well, it was the night.

840
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,514
"Let the darkness of the night

841
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,616
set the stage for love
with its thick curtains."

842
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,618
Shakespeare, <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

843
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,053
Right. So it was night.

844
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,523
We're inside a soon-to-be-gone school.
We saw Bob Dylan.

845
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,958
We were a bit drunk.

846
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,293
How didn't you sleep with each other?

847
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,095
That's what would happen.

848
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,598
-Huh?
-What?

849
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,599
Cut that part out.

850
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,169
Soseki. Are you experienced with women?

851
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,804
Could it be, Ms. Aoi,

852
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,206
you're bad at love?

853
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,576
Well…

854
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,248
Maybe I am. I had been noticing that

855
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,084
for a while.

856
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,821
It's impressive that you wrote
romance novels then.

857
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,127
In novels, men act the way I want them to.

858
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,128
Right?

859
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,703
So that's how it is.

860
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,541
You decided on that guy, then?

861
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,042
Kind of, yeah.

862
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,779
So I don't think I should see you anymore.

863
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,115
We're not cousins, you know.

864
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,753
-Was that a joke?
-Not very funny, huh?

865
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:28,125
That guy was actually really rich.

866
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,994
He owns several condos in Tokyo.

867
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,468
I didn't know! I scored big time.

868
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,070
-You lucked out.
-Yeah.

869
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,840
So, that's that.

870
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,342
I'm older, so I'll pay.

871
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,745
It was a lot of fun.

872
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,914
Can you leave first?

873
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:55,185
I like watching men who I've dated
walk away from me.

874
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,453
Let me see you off.

875
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,523
You move fast.

876
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,391
Are you sad?

877
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,764
Nope. I was just jealous that

878
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,398
you're this lucky.

879
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,368
I can't even win the toy I want
from a <i>gachapon.</i>

880
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,571
Your time will come.

881
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,642
Bye, Hikaru.

882
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,816
<i>In love, whoever says goodbye first</i>
<i>is the winner.</i>

883
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,720
<i>Mine wasn't romance though.</i>

884
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,289
Here you are!

885
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,526
Sora.

886
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,662
-Will you take a pic?
-Sure.

887
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,165
Alright.

888
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,738
-What are you doing?
-Ta-dah! Extended nose hair.

889
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:49,907
Realistic, right?

890
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,009
I was going to text a pic to him.

891
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,711
That nose hair…

892
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,581
-Where did you get it?
-I bought it online.

893
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,151
Funny, right? You know that place,
Taiyou-Do?

894
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,287
The chiropractor there told me about this.

895
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,989
-You mean Doctor Wataru?
-Yeah.

896
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,898
What are you trying to get?

897
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,002
Platelet.

898
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,806
Sorry for keeping you.

899
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,008
Not at all.
We'll go with the coated paper.

900
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,578
-Glossy.
-Oh, right.

901
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,647
Oh, also I have some news.

902
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,317
-Bad news?
-Why?

903
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,785
It's good news.

904
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,555
Looks like <i>Don't Forget Me</i>
could be made into a movie.

905
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,758
That's from years ago!

906
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,795
It won't happen, like always!

907
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,296
I think it will.

908
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,365
Oh shoot, I forgot.

909
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,735
A famous musician
said he wanted to do this movie.

910
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,607
He's the main character of our

911
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,243
"Early Spring 100 Books Fair."

912
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,746
I totally forgot his name.

913
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,017
CHIROPRACTIC: TAIYOU-DO

914
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,518
Welcome!

915
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,526
Why did you

916
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,428
come with

917
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,464
nose hair extensions?

918
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,700
Why?

919
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,636
Why did you wear nose hair

920
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,037
on our date, on purpose?

921
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,243
Hey,

922
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,212
you already got Platelet.

923
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,747
Look there.

924
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,015
You see that shiny ball?

925
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,617
The glass ball. I want that.

926
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,087
See you.

927
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,131
Wait a minute.

928
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,335
What am I doing?

929
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,938
I'm so sorry.

930
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,010
Is this him?

931
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,913
Yes, it's him!

932
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,847
YUTO KUON

933
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,116
No way! It's Yuto from Silent Knife!

934
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,618
I'm a huge fan!

935
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,420
I have all his CDs and concert Blu-rays.

936
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,889
He said he wanted to meet you in person.

937
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,326
Yes! This is a big one!

938
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,296
This rocks! This rocks! The Ezo red fox!

939
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,298
EZO RED FOX

940
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,768
I'm going to find love with him.

941
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,738
That's how I'll get back

942
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,173
at that monkey!

943
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,641
What are you saying?

944
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,645
I'll get back at Gonzo
for marrying that Aoba girl!

945
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,349
I'll find love with Yuto!

946
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,300
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE BEHIND THE SCENES
OF <i>DATE MY DAUGHTER!</i>

947
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,006
My socks came off!

948
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:12,576
PUTTING ON THE NOSE HAIR

949
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:13,710
DON'T BREATHE TOO MUCH.

950
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,479
Where's the nose hair?

951
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,718
THE DATE IS WITH
A WEATHER FORECASTER FROM ZIP!

952
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,455
Why do you always react

953
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,523
like you're in trouble?

954
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,592
-Cut!
-It's a cut!

955
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,595
"TAYAMA" WAS CHOSEN IN AN AUDITION

956
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,164
Soseki!

957
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,365
HE'S FINALLY ON SCREEN!

958
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,299
Where did he go? Geez.

959
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,608
<i>CELLS AT WORK!</i>

960
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,043
PLATELET,

<i>A movie, huh?</i>

963
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,194
Let's swap genders.

964
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,395
What?

965
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,130
Will you go on another date with me?

966
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,331
<i>I want to stop playing</i>

967
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,933
<i>with people's feelings.</i>

968
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,868
<i>I'm outdated, alright?</i>

969
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,104
-I'll protect you.
-Stupid.

970
