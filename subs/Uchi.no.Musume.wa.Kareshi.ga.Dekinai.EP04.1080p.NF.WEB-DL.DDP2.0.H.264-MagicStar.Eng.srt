1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,270
Let's organize what happened so far.

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,706
Oh, we're not parodying anyone
with our look.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:07,674
We're not.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,711
Episode One. Mom's series is canceled
by Saneisha.

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,880
No sign of a love interest.

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,816
<i>Episode Two, Mom's rejected</i>
<i>by Doctor Wataru.</i>

7
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,219
<i>Episode Three, Mom is rejected</i>
<i>by her last resort,</i>

8
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,321
<i>her childhood friend Gon-chan.</i>

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,290
This show shouldn't be called
<i>Date My Daughter!</i>

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,760
You're the one not finding anybody.

11
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,163
It should be called <i>Date Me!</i>

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,731
Come on, say it.

13
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,801
Date Me!

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,636
DATE ME!

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,471
What is this horrible title?

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,775
No one would approve of this title.
Not a station, not society.

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,809
-A station?
-TV station.

18
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,844
Your title has lies!

19
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,780
That's not true! I'll find a boyfriend!

20
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,748
I'll find someone! I'll get a boyfriend!

21
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,116
You hear that, folks?

22
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,985
You're the one without a boyfriend.

23
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,886
What?

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,989
<i>Date my daughter!</i>

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,635
Thank you for coming today.

26
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,003
SANEISHA

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,871
Room 808, right?

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:12,972
How did you know?

29
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,443
It's Saneisha's fanciest meeting room.

30
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,347
<i>DON'T FORGET ME</i>

31
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,785
We're so sorry!

32
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,721
What's going on?
You told them the time, right?

33
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,124
Yes, of course. Silet Knife's Yuto

34
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,494
is filming a morning drama series
right now and they're behind schedule.

35
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,397
-Sorry about this.
-It's fine. Is it the show, <i>Glaring Sun?</i>

36
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,999
No, that already ended.
Now, it's <i>Friendly Family.</i>

37
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,435
Oh, Yuto's going to be in that?

38
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,804
Keep it quiet.

39
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,706
They're saving him until Part Two.

40
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,309
He's here.

41
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,246
Sorry for the wait.

42
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,388
Ms. Minase, right?

43
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,694
You're more beautiful and youthful
than in the photos.

44
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,497
I'm Yuto.

45
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,469
You really are beautiful.

46
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,771
Well…

47
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,073
So,

48
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,042
I wanted to ask you something today.

49
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,311
What?

50
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,115
<i>Don't Forget Me</i> will be turned
into a movie?

51
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,184
And with Silent Knife? Cool!

52
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,086
Yes. Mom's at the meeting with him
right now.

53
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,888
She got all dolled up.

54
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,656
Silent Night? What the heck is that?

55
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,158
Silent Knife.

56
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,361
-Yuto, don't you know? He's super popular.
-Oh.

57
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,863
Mom is a big fan! She was all
pumped up this morning

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,366
and she got all dressed up.

59
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,536
-Her hat is this big! Like this…
-Um… Hello.

60
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,471
Welcome!

61
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,306
Found you.

62
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,513
I wanted to explain myself.

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,415
Why…

64
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,983
Why?

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,453
Why did you come to the date with
nose hair extensions?

66
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,823
I wore this

67
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,259
to our date.

68
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,096
This is new. I haven't used it yet,
so it's clean.

69
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,998
It's a two in one set.

70
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,969
This is the nose hair extension?

71
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,640
-Can I try it on?
-What?

72
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,710
Oh, sure, but…

73
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,156
How is it?

74
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,857
It's kind of cute.

75
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,561
It's not cute, but…

76
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,164
It's realistic.

77
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,201
I'm sorry! It was so rude of me!

78
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
I was

79
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,411
trying to be hated by you.

80
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,182
Why?

81
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,886
There's someone I can't forget.

82
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,488
I can't forget this person.

83
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,791
So I wanted to avoid

84
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,526
the really improbable case

85
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,329
of you ever liking me.

86
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,799
I wanted to make sure that
this date didn't go well.

87
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,904
Then why did you ask me to go
see the otters?

88
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,341
Because I wanted to see the otters.

89
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,145
With you.

90
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,386
But you have someone you can't
forget, right?

91
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,326
Then, I wish you would've told me.

92
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,063
It's so sneaky to try to be hated

93
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,631
by showing your nose hair.

94
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,733
It's so patronizing.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,834
That's not what I…

96
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,169
I feel like

97
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,072
I was treated as a child.

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,842
I feel like I was belittled.

99
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,445
I…

100
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,085
Goodbye.

101
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,224
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

102
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>I said goodbye to a man</i>
<i>and left the table.</i>

103
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,564
<i>It felt a little like I was the heroine</i>
<i>of a story.</i>

104
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,700
<i>It felt good.</i>

105
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>Nine parts sad, one part good.</i>

106
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,372
<i>The ratio of my heart.</i>

107
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,476
I don't think I'm saying
anything difficult.

108
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,380
The girlfriend dies at the end of
<i>Don't Forget Me,</i> right?

109
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,483
I wanted it to be that only I die.

110
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,752
Then what about the title?

111
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,621
The "me" would be me.

112
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,259
I think that's a great idea.

113
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,261
-I think it's good.
-What?

114
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,831
The movie production company

115
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,567
and the producer and the screenwriter,

116
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,936
they all agree, right?

117
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,371
Yes.

118
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,773
The company agrees with this plot change.

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,009
It's better if I'm the one to die.

120
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,979
Then the girls would go,
"Oh no! Yuto's dying!"

121
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,081
It's not Yuto. It's Shuji.

122
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,249
Oh, the name?

123
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,918
The name doesn't matter.

124
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,122
Yes, sir. The script is already written
with this plot change.

125
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,390
What?

126
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,392
Without my consent?

127
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,993
What?

128
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,129
Oh? Did I not mention it to you?

129
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,465
I don't like

130
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,502
hard words like consent.

131
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,838
I don't want to use words like that
between us.

132
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,877
Maybe you don't need
my original text then.

133
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,880
It's a different story, after all.

134
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,014
No, no.

135
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,350
It has to be your work.

136
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,952
The lines you write are awesome. Right?

137
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,822
Yes, I wrote them down.

138
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,959
I picked out all the best parts,
Ms. Minase.

139
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:10,763
"You only meet someone once.
Once you meet them, you can't meet them"

140
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,766
-"for the first time ever again."
-I want to say lines like that.

141
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,269
That's Naoko's line.

142
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,237
Hey, listen…

143
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,672
It's almost time.

144
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,476
So let's just swap the male
and female characters.

145
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,311
I'll be the one to die.

146
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,913
Sorry, Ms. Minase.

147
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,482
I have a recording session now.

148
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,385
I'm so busy. I hate it!

149
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,890
I'm excited to stand next to you
when this film is done, Ms. Minase.

150
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,192
See ya.

151
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,332
So, Ms. Aoi. You know how it is.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,203
This movie is a big opportunity
for you, too.

153
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,806
The world will know about
Aoi Minase once again.

154
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,508
We'll push our marketing, too.

155
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,177
It'll be all about Aoi Minase.

156
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,380
You know, Ms. Aoi.

157
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,584
We're still waiting on your proposal
for your new book.

158
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,586
We have a limit to

159
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,722
how many new books we can publish
in a year.

160
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,293
We have a lot of writers
who want to publish through us.

161
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,864
You know what I'm saying.
We're all adults here.

162
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,266
Thank you for helping us make this movie.

163
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,473
Manga, the internet, games…

164
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,208
Literary Department's being

165
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,544
pushed out everywhere.

166
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:35,948
Hey, you.

167
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,417
Did you know about this?

168
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,821
No. But I thought it was weird
that we'd meet Yuto so soon.

169
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,457
SILENT KNIFE

170
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
I came here to get this autographed.

171
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,796
I'm so stupid!

172
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,401
Let's speak out against this.
And stop this film.

173
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,937
You didn't hear what Konishi said?

174
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,472
It's an agreement!

175
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,440
I have to give over my rights.

176
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,777
Otherwise, they won't publish my new book.
That's what he said.

177
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,513
That's not right.

178
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,316
Ms. Aoi, we have to strategize.

179
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,786
I've hit my peak already.
No one cares about my stuff!

180
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,455
We have to accept this movie
with these wild conditions.

181
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,090
Otherwise, I can't keep on writing!

182
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,228
Excuse me, Ms. Aoi,

183
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,463
but the publishing industry is
suffering everywhere.

184
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,465
Reality is even worse.

185
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,002
A lot of writers get part-time jobs,
because they can't get work…

186
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,938
Who do you think I am?

187
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,874
I'm Aoi Minase.

188
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,153
Will you leave me alone for a bit?

189
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,857
Leave me alone for a bit!

190
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,228
I understand.

191
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,356
<i>DON'T FORGET ME</i>

192
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,416
I wanted to clean up inside.

193
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,450
It's still in use.

194
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,709
<i>HAPPY KANAKO'S KILLER LIFE</i>

195
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,744
There's someone I can't forget.

196
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,114
What's wrong with me?

197
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,251
I can't laugh at my favorite lines.

198
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,794
I'm home!

199
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,233
Welcome home.

200
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,116
We're so sorry!

201
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,985
-What?
-We thought we could finally

202
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,988
let Nako up in heaven relax for a bit.

203
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,356
We're so sorry!

204
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,158
Wait. Why now?

205
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,661
I already bought a white tuxedo
at Marunouchi for the wedding!

206
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,297
What's going on here?

207
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,834
Well, Miss Aoba was very pretty, right?

208
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,503
Yes. Very much so.

209
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,739
In Roppongi, in the residence area
where people live,

210
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,309
she attended a party with rich people
that live in that area.

211
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,446
A CEO of an IT company fell smitten
with her.

212
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,381
She went to a party

213
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,917
after meeting with my son?

214
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,886
Apparently it's common.

215
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,488
A professional girlfriend,
do they call it? They search

216
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,191
around for men with better statuses,
and strike

217
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,359
when the timing's right!

218
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,327
I thought she struck for Gon!

219
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,731
She did, but she found an even better one
after that!

220
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,601
Maybe she clapped twice, like clap clap!

221
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,340
It seems like

222
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,643
she was lying about
falling in love with you

223
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,179
and visiting the shop to see you.

224
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,947
Looks like she was

225
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,850
-looking at the asset value of this shop.
-Asset value?

226
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,786
How much this place is worth
when you sell it.

227
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,722
Hey, Mrs. Toyoda.
You're the one spilling all the tea!

228
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,525
Land prices are going up.
You know, with Takanawa Gateball?

229
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,028
The new Yamanote Line station
they're making!

230
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,296
It's Takanawa Gateway!

231
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,764
Can't play gateball at a station!

232
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,467
So in other words,
our home is worth a lot of money.

233
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,204
She was after your money!

234
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,742
I'm glad it didn't work out!
She's like a sly fox!

235
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,913
If she became your wife,
you would've struggled a lot!

236
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,649
She was way too young and pretty
for you, you know?

237
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,284
-Right?
-Yes!

238
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,722
You two just say what you wan't,
don't you?

239
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,190
60 orders of taiyaki!

240
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,392
Thank you very much!

241
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,028
<i>To apologize, Mrs.Toyoda and</i>
<i>Mrs. Kanbayashi</i>

242
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,231
<i>placed a big order for taiyaki</i>
<i>and went home.</i>

243
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,002
-What should I do with this?
-I'll wear it.

244
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,704
Dad, you're getting married?

245
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,940
I'm just saying, you don't know
what'll happen in life.

246
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,508
You scared me.

247
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,043
You look relieved.

248
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,879
Why would I be relieved?

249
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,815
Because you were trying to get married
for Nako.

250
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,316
Not for yourself.

251
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,919
"This place,

252
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,154
this spot next to me including Odaya,

253
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,391
I want to reserve that spot for Aoi."

254
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,995
What are you saying? Have you gone senile?

255
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,699
When you say mean things like that,

256
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,334
it means I'm right.

257
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,337
Don't say dumb things.
Why would I be with that tomboy?

258
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,974
She's been too old to be called a tomboy.
And she gained weight…

259
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,809
I knew all along.

260
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,779
When you came back from France,

261
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,215
when you left Étoile and came home…

262
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,653
<i>Gon-chan used to be married</i>
<i>to a Parisienne named Étoile</i>

263
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,622
<i>who was ten, twenty years</i>
<i>younger than him.</i>

264
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,624
<i>He fell in love</i>

265
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,493
<i>while traveling the world.</i>

266
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,595
That happened because Étoile got with

267
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,932
a young pastry chef and left me.

268
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,733
And in front of Notre Dame, no less!

269
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,635
On the surface, that's what happened.

270
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,973
But you came back for Aoi.

271
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,241
It was all decided

272
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
by God.

273
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,314
I can't keep up with your romantic
nonsense! I'm going to go take a bath.

274
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,015
SUZURAN HOT SPRINGS

275
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,554
<i>Gon-chan!</i>

276
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,656
Let's not become a wife.

277
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,396
Ah, god!

278
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,032
On the surface, it's a good bet.

279
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,535
-A bet?
-The big production movie.

280
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,503
It'll be distributed by Kamisaka.

281
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,940
The theme song will of course be by
the extremely popular Silent Knife.

282
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,676
The director is Shinji Iwata.
He's done many popular films.

283
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,346
This could make a billion yen, at least.

284
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,247
Considering Yuto's popularity,

285
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,117
some say we could even aim for
ten billion.

286
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,186
Anyone can speculate, right?

287
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,289
And we got Lili Mashiba to play Naoko.

288
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,192
Wow! She's really popular.

289
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,295
Yes, so it's a good bet.

290
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,500
But they're switching the
male and female characters, right?

291
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,203
Shuji dies and Naoko lives.

292
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,140
Yes. That's the absolute requirement
set by Yuto.

293
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,011
<i>Don't Forget Me,</i> with the
two characters reversed.

294
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,145
This is the storyline.

295
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,813
It's the plot.

296
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,714
What?

297
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,016
I tested the script

298
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,752
to see if the story would work
with the roles reversed.

299
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,721
I understand that this was rude,

300
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,556
but I changed some parts.

301
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,495
How long did this take you?

302
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,365
Three days.

303
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,767
You haven't slept, have you?

304
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,136
I'm fine.

305
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,242
But, I'm sorry.

306
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,413
In my "Don't Forget Me,"

307
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,716
Naoko has to die. That's the story.

308
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,786
And Shuji has to live.

309
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,591
Let's say no, then.

310
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,103
I want money, and I want a place
to publish my next book.

311
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,508
I want to publish my next book!

312
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,078
Listen.

313
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,881
My best work is always my next work.

314
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,020
My next work always has to be
the greatest work.

315
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,260
I heard rumors.

316
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,162
Is it true you plagiarized?

317
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,301
You worked in manga, right?
Shonen Up of Saneisha.

318
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,004
You turned <i>Zephyr</i> and <i>Shinogi</i>
into big hits, right?

319
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,640
Yes.

320
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,878
Then, you ran out of ideas
for <i>Young Monster</i>

321
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,415
and plagiarized plot points
from a book published abroad.

322
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,318
You made the manga artist write it
as if it were your own ideas.

323
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,321
Yuzuru Yube. He's very famous.

324
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,493
This was big news back in the day.

325
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,662
Everyone's forgotten, but I read about
it in Bunshun.

326
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,699
I didn't know that was you.

327
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,338
That's why you got transferred from
manga to literary.

328
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,374
And now, you're my editor.

329
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,411
We're both failures, aren't we?

330
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,550
I've never plagiarized, though.

331
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,622
You're not a failure, Ms. Aoi.
You're a Tiffany.

332
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,191
What?

333
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,562
You're the real thing, who doesn't lose
against the times

334
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,564
or the commotion of society.

335
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,368
You write novels that are loved

336
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,136
across generations.

337
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,740
Excuse me.

338
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,715
Wait a minute! Oh! Not there!

339
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,417
You can't go there!

340
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,086
Sorry, you're busy. I'll call you back.

341
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,222
It's fine. My daughter will be back soon.

342
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,157
She went for a haircut.

343
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,192
Oh, she's back.

344
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,360
No, you've got it wrong!

345
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,129
What? I'm wrong?

346
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,965
You are!
This is about <i>Young Monster,</i> right?

347
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,801
It was Yuzuru Yube who plagiarized.

348
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,504
<i>But Shonen Up publishes abroad, too.</i>

349
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,607
<i>The writer themselves found it, and sued.</i>

350
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,209
Soseki took the blame,

351
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,645
so that Yuzuru Yube's name

352
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,414
won't be tainted.

353
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,682
Seriously?

354
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,352
But that's unfair for the company
to transfer Soseki!

355
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,355
<i>Ms. Aoi, that's what working</i>
<i>at a company is like.</i>

356
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,758
It's full of unfairness and injustices.

357
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,160
<i>Well,</i>

358
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,295
<i>I did think that when you volunteered</i>

359
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,565
<i>to retire early, even though</i>
<i>you're such a good editor.</i>

360
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,535
So Soseki's innocent.

361
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:42,307
Oh no! What should I do?

362
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,376
I really cornered him!

363
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,078
Like I was placing stones

364
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,913
on the lap of a violent criminal!

365
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,049
I don't know what that means,
but Soseki's innocent.

366
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,618
But you know, you know?

367
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,020
Listen to me, Matsuyama.

368
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,357
When I'm with him, I end up
saying everything that's on my mind!

369
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,826
Even things I don't need to say out loud!

370
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,696
"I want money, I want a place to publish,
my greatest work is my next work…"

371
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,232
So embarrassing! Totally embarrassing!

372
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,501
I blabbed on about embarrassing things,

373
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,304
which made me hate him,
which made me aggressive.

374
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,239
I wanted to corner him.

375
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,042
Ms. Aoi, are you doing it again?

376
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,477
What?

377
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,313
You aren't falling for him, are you?

378
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,915
No, I don't think so.

379
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,019
No way, no way, Nile crocodile?

380
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,021
NILE CROCODILE

381
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,423
Yup.

382
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,492
RISSEI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

383
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,760
Let's get Korean cheese hot dogs!

384
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,296
Good idea! The one that stretches, right?

385
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,598
-Good idea, dawg!
-Irino!

386
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,334
Hey.

387
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,136
Can we talk?

388
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,773
Come in, come in.

389
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,675
You just work here part-time, right?

390
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,811
-You act like it's your own house. Ouch!
-Welcome!

391
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,979
SANMAYAKI, 180 YEN

392
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,316
Should I get taiyaki or sanmayaki?

393
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,685
Why are you staring at the menu like that?

394
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,787
You work here. You have it memorized.

395
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,888
Huh?

396
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:08,994
Looking at it and thinking hard
about what to get is the fun part.

397
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,964
Thank you!

398
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,204
-Hey.
-Ken, water, please!

399
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,105
Coming right up!

400
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,847
-Here's water.
-Two taiyaki, please.

401
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,416
I haven't had lunch. I want yakisoba.

402
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,685
If so, pay for yourself. I'm broke.

403
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,655
You brought me all the way here!

404
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,457
But it's okay because
the food's good here.

405
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,491
One yakisoba, please.

406
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,392
Thank you.

407
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,961
Don't you get sick of working with this?

408
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,529
Ouch!

409
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,498
Ow…

410
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,201
So, what is it?

411
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,838
There's a reason I brought you here.

412
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,775
I didn't want to show you this
near the school.

413
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,443
They'd figure out you're an otaku.

414
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,847
I did some sketches.

415
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,549
What?

416
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,785
I drew some sketches.

417
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,388
A country, not here, not in the present.

418
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,157
A country where stories are forbidden.

419
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,995
So cool!

420
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,332
-Really?
-The concept sketches! This is it!

421
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,667
Is this right?

422
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,302
Yes, totally.

423
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,105
I can't think up of things like this
myself.

424
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,842
It was this blurry image in my head.

425
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,344
But now it's here, in front of me!

426
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,514
You're amazing, you!

427
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,681
My name's not "you."

428
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,616
Oh.

429
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,486
Miss Minase? Her Majesty?

430
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,222
Oh, Her Highness?

431
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,757
Just Minase's fine.

432
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,159
Irino's fine for me, too.

433
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,228
This solidifies my image so much!

434
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,497
I can think of so many stories now!

435
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,865
I'll go home and edit.

436
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,170
Wait, you…

437
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,238
I mean, Minase.

438
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,742
You'll draw with me?
I thought you were busy with your date.

439
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,548
Oh, right. The nose hair ended it.

440
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,083
It was nose hair extensions.

441
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,352
Nose hair extensions?

442
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,922
He wanted to be hated by me because

443
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,423
he has someone he can't forget.

444
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,791
What the hell?

445
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,461
The day I heard that,

446
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,129
my insides were spinning.

447
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,933
Around here. It kept on spinning around.

448
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,036
"That pisses me off!"
"It feels like I'm spinning!"

449
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,939
I wanted to forget about all that.

450
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,674
So I drew what I could think of

451
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,375
for your concept art.

452
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,781
He wanted to be hated, because there's
someone he can't forget?

453
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,449
Yes.

454
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:48,286
Why doesn't he call her "the person he
likes," or his girlfriend?

455
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,856
Which means,
it's not like he likes anyone,

456
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,657
and it's not like he has a girlfriend.

457
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,461
You're observant, and smart.

458
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,796
You're right.

459
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,734
Maybe it's an ex that he can't forget.

460
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,069
In that case,

461
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,405
why can't he forget them?

462
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,007
You can forget ex-girlfriends.

463
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,009
Are you a pro at romance?

464
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,377
I've only experienced

465
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,046
surface-level romance.

466
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,982
Surface-level romance?

467
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,151
Romance that was dishonest.

468
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,620
What's dishonest love?

469
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,688
How do I say it?

470
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,490
Love that happened thoughtlessly.

471
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,959
You mean, it started with sex?

472
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,862
Don't say that with such twinkling eyes.

473
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,799
I'm encountering the Unknown.

474
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,801
Here you are!

475
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,705
I'll be heading home now. Thank you.

476
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,574
You ate a lot again,

477
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,842
Aoi.

478
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,310
I'm stress eating.

479
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,479
Don't be so down. I don't know

480
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,148
anything about the film industry,
but think about the future!

481
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,750
-You're right.
-Yeah.

482
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,186
-But I can only come here for so long.
-What?

483
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,923
Because you're getting married to Aoba.

484
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,926
About that, Aoi. A lot happened, and…

485
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,795
Just enjoy the moment!
Keep my smile in your memories.

486
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,864
What are you saying?

487
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,999
-I'll be back!
-Don't come back!

488
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,002
-Be nice to your dad!
-Oh.

489
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,871
Sora, you're here?

490
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,706
Huh?

491
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,443
Huh? Huh? A cute boy!

492
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,479
Mom, your inner monologue is coming out.
Turn it off.

493
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,450
You're Aoi Minase, right?

494
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,486
I'm such a big fan!
My mom was a big fan of yours originally.

495
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,122
I've read your books!

496
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,357
Oh my!

497
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,327
Sorry about that. I'm Hikaru Irino.

498
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,197
-I'm so moved!
-Excuse me.

499
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,033
Are you still doing lunch?

500
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,201
Yes, come in.

501
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,836
Doctor Wataru!

502
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,679
What is this? A comedy sketch?

503
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,348
I don't even watch comedy.

504
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,651
The nose hair extensions you
told me about,

505
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,654
they're so funny! It was a big hit.

506
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,856
-This is the nose hair guy?
-Nose hair guy?

507
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,892
Why is everyone calling me nose hair guy?

508
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,595
Come in, please sit!
We only have yakisoba.

509
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,030
Thank you.

510
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,298
No nose hair today?

511
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,103
-Well…
-Who's this person you can't forget?

512
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,638
-Your ex-girlfriend?
-What?

513
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:23,508
She took it hard. She was spinning.

514
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,244
-Yeah, you were sad!
-Don't intervene, Mom!

515
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,979
I'm not a kid anymore.

516
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,281
Oh, I'm sorry.

517
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,717
What's going on? I'm lost.

518
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,253
What? What happened?

519
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,694
It's not a girlfriend, or someone I like.

520
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,330
But…

521
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,066
It's someone you can't forget.

522
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,003
It's more like, someone
I shouldn't forget.

523
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,206
I know! Maybe she's dead!

524
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,775
Is your girlfriend dead?

525
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,109
Or a dead fiancé, maybe?

526
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,578
Hey, shut up! It's not a joke!
It's real life!

527
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,313
What if you were right? So insensitive!

528
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,316
No, it's fine. She's not dead.

529
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,153
She's alive. Somewhere…

530
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,054
Somewhere?

531
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,527
We made a promise
in front of the bunny cage.

532
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,996
-Bunny cage?
-Yes.

533
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,631
We were in charge of the bunnies.

534
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,666
We were feeding Miu together.

535
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,967
Miu?

536
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,904
The name of the bunny.

537
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,574
Doctor Wataru, how old were you?

538
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,178
I was in the third grade. I was nine.

539
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,316
Everyone went home when Miu was dying,

540
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,219
but we stayed behind to be by her side.

541
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,489
And in her final moments, Miu
did a little hop.

542
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,525
Hey!

543
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,994
I just imagined it in my head.

544
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,598
I thought that was her way
of saying thank you.

545
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,268
That's not funny!

546
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,772
But she moved away.

547
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,442
We promised to get married.

548
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,544
What?

549
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,315
I wanted a family.

550
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,652
I'm not explaining correctly.

551
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,389
I lost both my parents when I was young

552
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,425
in a car accident.

553
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,461
My uncle took me in.

554
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,497
I'm very thankful to my uncle.

555
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:30,401
But it was different from having
a real family.

556
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,438
So I just imagined in my head

557
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,673
that the bunny cage girl and Miu

558
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,810
were my real family.

559
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,311
A place where I can feel calm.

560
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,248
And have you met that girl?

561
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,252
No. I don't even know where she lives.

562
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,087
You've loved her this whole time?

563
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,557
Well, you know, I'm an adult so…

564
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,826
if someone approaches me
"just to have fun," then I…

565
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,528
I don't need those details!

566
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,331
You wanted to keep the promise
at nine years old all this time.

567
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,535
I felt like I had to.

568
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,874
We held hands in front of the bunny cage.
It was my first time

569
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,110
holding hands with a girl

570
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,646
other than dancing "Turkey in the Straw".

571
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,781
I can't forget the

572
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,919
feeling of her small hands in mine
from that time.

573
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,822
-Here's your yakisoba.
-But…

574
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,825
I'm a weird guy, right?
It's pretty creepy.

575
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,862
Well, you know,

576
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,232
all men have

577
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,434
a creepy side to them.

578
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,336
That's human, right?

579
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,173
But, Sora.

580
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,743
I'm glad you have such
a wonderful boyfriend.

581
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,180
That's much better than getting
involved with me.

582
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,116
Sorry for intruding on your date.

583
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,086
I'll go to McDonald's for lunch.
I'll be back.

584
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,628
How impressive, to keep loving the same
girl since third grade.

585
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,165
I'm sorry! Pay with this.

586
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,368
What? Wait.

587
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,036
ODAYA TAIYAKI

588
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:20,879
Doctor Wataru!

589
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,250
Sora.

590
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,854
I… Um…

591
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:32,757
What is it?

592
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,059
Well…

593
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,998
I know that I won't be enough.

594
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,333
I completely understand that, but…

595
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,472
Just like how you can't

596
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,875
forget holding her small hand.

597
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,780
When you fixed my glasses,

598
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,482
when I tripped

599
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,251
with that Soy-ppucino…

600
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,188
I can't forget it too!

601
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,993
You know, it's probably nothing
compared to

602
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,029
your hand-holding, but…

603
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,699
I don't think it's a competition.

604
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,037
So, in that case,

605
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,906
will you go

606
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,342
on a date with me one more time?

607
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,810
Without your nose hair!

608
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,681
Not a fake date.

609
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,250
A real date.

610
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,197
You challenged a nine-year-old girl!

611
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,866
And a girl of his past!

612
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,970
She's romanticized to the max!
She's a strong enemy!

613
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,739
Stop it! Stop it, please!

614
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,108
I'll only lose!

615
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,311
Fight hard, Sora.

616
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,580
You're choking me! Stop!

617
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,583
I was worried about how
shy you were, Sora.

618
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,820
Even in class, you never raised your hand
to solve problems you could solve!

619
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,390
You always dressed like
you were going on stage on Parents' Day!

620
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,726
It was so embarrassing!

621
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,662
I was so moved that you ran

622
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,231
and took action!
In life, you have to take action

623
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,265
and get hurt!

624
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,834
I haven't been dumped yet!

625
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,169
Anyways, Mom was so proud
you took the next step….

626
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,306
I said, you're choking me!

627
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,841
Ouch…

628
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,077
Hey, Mom?

629
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,178
Oops.

630
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,747
Are you okay?

631
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,048
Are you crying?

632
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,617
Why, all of a sudden? What should I do?

633
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,955
I don't want the movie! I really don't!

634
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,692
I want to back out!

635
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,361
My fans would cry!

636
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,031
I'd cry, too!

637
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,269
<i>In the box we've had since I was born,</i>

638
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,873
<i>it's filled with supportive letters</i>

639
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,542
<i>from all of Mom's fans.</i>

640
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,611
<i>Mom's novels are loved</i>

641
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,813
<i>by so many people</i>

642
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,915
<i>that Mom or I've never met.</i>

643
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,922
Why are you calling me?

644
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,591
I'm just letting you know that

645
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,093
I'm getting married for real.

646
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,831
Would you come to my wedding, Hikaru?

647
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,332
That would be weird.

648
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,703
<i>Really? I think it would be funny.</i>

649
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,774
I don't want to play around
with people's emotions

650
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,210
and my own emotions like that.

651
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,279
I want to quit that.

652
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,348
-Oh?
-I want to be more simple.

653
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,884
More easy.

654
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,987
Will you go on another date with me?

655
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,391
<i>What changed?</i>

656
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,360
Oh, do you have a new crush?

657
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,895
What?

658
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,597
The edamame thrower.

659
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,833
Did I mention that?

660
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,134
<i>You did.</i>

661
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,504
Because it was the first time
you talked about a girl.

662
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,405
I remembered.

663
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,309
You remember weird things.

664
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,678
<i>Okay.</i>

665
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,215
I shouldn't get in the way of
innocent love.

666
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,383
I won't call.

667
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,152
Yeah.

668
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,421
I'll delete your number.

669
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,223
Yeah. Got it.

670
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,658
Be happy, okay?

671
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,862
I mean it.

672
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,334
What is it?

673
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,969
This is unacceptable.

674
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,904
Oh, that?

675
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,472
It makes no sense!

676
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,574
We knew that they'd swap
the guy and the girl.

677
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,110
But why does Shuji come back to life?

678
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,312
He gets frozen, comes back to life
after 30 years,

679
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,282
and gets together with Naoko's daughter?
What is this?

680
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,451
Apparently, that's Yuto's idea.

681
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,386
They say sad endings don't sell.

682
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:59,190
The film company also said that
large-scale stories like that sell better.

683
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,225
And this scenario's full of holes!

684
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,161
It's full of plot contradictions.

685
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,730
We got the okay from the film company

686
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,431
and the production board.

687
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,735
We just have to push through!

688
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,304
We can't send this to Ms. Minase
no matter what.

689
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,539
Huh?

690
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,841
-I already did.
-What?

691
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,913
<i>DON'T FORGET ME</i>

692
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,682
What is this?

693
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,220
-Thank you!
-Come again!

694
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,492
What are you doing, Dad?

695
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,727
Is someone here?

696
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,828
OPEN

697
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,900
No, no one's here.

698
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,368
It's just, you know…

699
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,270
Oh, right!

700
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,073
I was called by Manabe
from the district board.

701
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,809
I'm going to go see him!

702
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,378
Maybe I'll wear my Gucci coat!

703
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,321
AOI MINASE

704
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,123
-Oh, hello?
<i>-It's me.</i>

705
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,191
<i>-About the script…</i>
-Thanks!

706
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,726
Ms. Aoi, I'll call you back.

707
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,861
Mr. Kakei!

708
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,496
Who are you?

709
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,998
I'm Tachibana, from Saneisha.

710
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,766
I'm Aoi Minase's editor.

711
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,469
You waited outside for me? Dang.

712
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,605
Hiro, I'm here!

713
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,406
You're as beautiful as always!

714
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,941
About the script…

715
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,176
What?

716
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,378
Could we fix it up a little more?

717
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,746
This doesn't work for us.

718
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,149
Don't add post-its to
someone's masterpiece!

719
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,985
I'm sorry about that, but…

720
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,187
I wanted to fill in the plot holes.

721
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,455
Please.

722
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,024
What is this about?

723
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,227
<i>Don't Forget Me?</i> Oh, that?

724
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,763
I'm writing a lot of scripts.

725
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,064
Who's in charge of this?

726
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,867
I think Ono and Saka were
messing around with that.

727
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,502
Oh, right.

728
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,372
You don't write them yourself?

729
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,407
That's not your business.

730
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,743
Okay, okay, okay…

731
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,011
This is an idol movie.

732
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,113
This is one of those movies

733
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,982
that delinquent high school kids watch

734
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,286
in their local department store
while waiting for their bowling slot.

735
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,622
They like it when there's plot holes.

736
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,358
Then, they can make fun of it.

737
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,927
They want to feel smart.

738
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,462
So, that's that.

739
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,700
Do you not trust your audience, Mr. Kakei?

740
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,602
What?

741
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,338
Is that fun to write?

742
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,041
You're an amateur. Don't butt in.

743
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm not a complete amateur.

744
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,848
I've been a manga editor for ten years.

745
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,618
I've always supported my writers.

746
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,987
What are you saying?

747
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,756
Writing's not fun at all!

748
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,426
That's why I try to write
as little as possible.

749
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,528
What's fun is

750
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,862
hanging out with hot girls

751
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,032
with the money I earned!

752
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,704
<i>Don't do anything, Ms. Aoi.</i>

753
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,373
Why? I can't sit still

754
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,108
after seeing this!

755
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,712
Konishi… No, he's useless.

756
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,247
Maybe I can walk into the film company.

757
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,516
They'll just make fun of you.
It's pointless.

758
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,485
You're Aoi Minase.

759
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,587
Don't do the dirty work.
That won't look cool.

760
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,255
Please leave it to me.

761
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,725
Is it your job to get covered in mud?

762
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,263
Is that why you took the blame for

763
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,099
Yuzuru Yube's plagiarism?

764
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,702
Mr. Yube is a talented person.

765
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,672
<i>Talent is a gift from the gods.</i>

766
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,941
<i>I protect that in any way I can.</i>

767
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,010
<i>Because that's my job.</i>

768
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,481
But…

769
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,950
What should we do?

770
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:50,988
I'll go speak to Yuto from Silent Knife
directly.

771
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,657
If you do something like that,

772
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,226
you might get fired!

773
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,927
I don't think I'd get fired.

774
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,663
Maybe a transfer to the
records keeping department.

775
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,134
Ms. Aoi. If that happens, please read

776
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,335
the records I write.

777
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,780
What the hell is this?

778
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,148
It's arranged by Mr. Tsuzuki.

779
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,584
Don't joke with me.

780
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,220
He ruined my song!

781
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:26,190
Hey, CEO. This is unacceptable, right?

782
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:31,061
I'd say that's a personal opinion.

783
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,365
Music is personal taste.

784
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,669
I'm the one that got the genius producer,
Katsuya Tsuzuki for you.

785
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,372
Just do this for me, Yuto.

786
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,244
This arrangement kills my music!

787
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,548
He just added some cheap coating
with electronic sounds on top.

788
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,050
The intro is so lame, too.

789
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,452
It sounds so fake!

790
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,188
Your sales are going down.

791
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,824
Your song sales are declining
a bit by bit.

792
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,559
Once it starts declining,

793
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,994
It doesn't take much time
until rock bottom!

794
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,866
That's why I said I'll do the movie!

795
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,802
Let me at least do my music
the way I want.

796
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,172
We're not doing this job
for looks or on a whim, either.

797
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,441
This is business.

798
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,915
How did this outsider get in here?

799
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,451
You're making the theme song
for the movie!

800
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,553
What's wrong with showing it
to the editor?

801
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,555
No, I…

802
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,925
I won't accept that arrangement!

803
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,494
It kills the song!

804
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,996
Who do you think helped the scrappy rat

805
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,732
doing street performances
while working at the gyoza shop?

806
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,733
What the hell?

807
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,135
Hey, CEO!

808
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,137
Yuto! Calm down!

809
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,139
Let's reschedule!

810
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,909
We're sorry, Saneisha!

811
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,676
Yuto.

812
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,146
I think this one's better.

813
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:32,650
Right?

814
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,686
Even an amateur could tell.

815
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,290
Even amateurs have hearts

816
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,025
and the ability to feel.

817
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,462
Oh, sorry.

818
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,303
I don't think the quality of
an arrangement is personal taste.

819
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,672
There's a right answer.

820
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,877
It's our job to find out
what the best answer is.

821
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,180
"Our"?

822
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,718
For me, that's editing.

823
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,154
I edit novels and manga.

824
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:12,990
Oh, sure.

825
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,359
Yuto.

826
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,063
Just now, you said that the song
would die.

827
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,368
Just like music has a life,

828
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,503
stories have a life, too.

829
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,109
What you're trying to do

830
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,178
based on this script is

831
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,446
to kill the story.

832
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,449
You're killing Aoi Minase's work.

833
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,354
You must know this.

834
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,424
How much time was spent

835
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,326
suffering and struggling

836
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,961
to create a living thing.

837
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,465
Creating isn't all fun.

838
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,205
I knew it from the start.

839
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,707
That this was unacceptable.

840
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,619
I used to be a street rat making
900 yen an hour at a gyoza shop

841
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,188
and working part-time.

842
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,429
But even then, I really loved
Aoi Minase's novels.

843
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,034
Her words glistened

844
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,837
like jewels and diamonds.

845
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,047
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,019
Please apologize to Ms. Aoi for me.

847
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,123
Doctor Wataru.

848
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,159
I got a call from Mr. Yoshida.

849
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,095
He said his knees hurt at night.
He wants to talk to you.

850
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,029
I'll talk to him.

851
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,731
No, you're on your lunch break right now.

852
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,467
I told him you'd call back
once you're free.

853
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,235
Thank you. After I eat this.

854
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:09,073
He just wants to talk to you.

855
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,053
Hello?

856
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,323
Yes, hello?

857
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,192
What?

858
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,828
I said, he just called me!

859
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,031
He said he felt a rush to call me
when he held his phone.

860
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:35,999
I see.

861
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,704
A date! A real date this time!

862
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,139
That's great.

863
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,108
Telling him how you felt was worth it.

864
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,543
Yes. It's all thanks to you, Irino.

865
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,078
<i>Because that time,</i>

866
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,848
<i>you asked him,</i>
<i>"Who's the person you can't forget?"</i>

867
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,283
That opened the way for this!

868
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,885
All thanks to you!

869
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,421
You better buy me lunch sometime.

870
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:58,722
Really?

871
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,691
Yes. They'll follow the novel.

872
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,960
They promised to
find a proper screenwriter

873
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,329
and recreate the whole thing.

874
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,999
He said he'll say he won't do it
unless they follow through.

875
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,869
Alright!

876
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:16,006
I just dropped by to tell you that.

877
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,107
I'll be on my way.

878
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,109
Wait, Soseki!

879
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:20,978
You have a little cut here.

880
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,049
-I was so nervous.
-What?

881
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,684
To see Silent Knife.

882
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,822
I've been to their Tokyo Dome concert
with Sally before.

883
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,225
It's so nerve-wracking to assert myself
to someone like that!

884
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,762
I'm such a peasant.

885
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,299
Yeah. He's a celebrity afterall.

886
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,001
OINTMENT

887
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:44,902
All done.

888
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,670
Thank you.

889
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,641
Want a drink?

890
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,509
I don't really drink.

891
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,245
We have Sora's Limoncello. It's sweet.

892
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,214
Thank you. I'll take that.

893
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,486
Are you hungry?

894
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,054
I haven't eaten since this morning.

895
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,390
Right. You had a lot on your plate.

896
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,560
I'm sure you'll say no,

897
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,695
but we have curry noodles.

898
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,765
I'd love that. At two minutes, 47 seconds.

899
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,810
<i>The city was upside down.</i>

900
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,279
<i>It was interesting.</i>

901
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,228
So sweet!

902
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,164
Good, right?

903
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,236
Yes. It's good.

904
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,176
Thank you.

905
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,315
Good work. Thank you.

906
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,528
You thanking me makes me

907
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,197
really emotional.

908
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,467
What?

909
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,169
I became an editor

910
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,406
because I loved

911
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,708
<i>Don't Forget Me.</i>

912
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,245
I love <i>The Scent of the Sky,</i> too.

913
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,917
I joined Saneisha because
I wanted to become

914
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,053
Aoi Minase's editor.

915
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,661
Why do you say things like that now?

916
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,167
I was never going to say it to you.

917
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:28,532
Idiot.

918
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,924
<i>It happened</i>

919
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,727
<i>in the two minutes and 47 seconds</i>

920
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,596
<i>while waiting for the cup noodles to cook.</i>

921
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,113
Action!

922
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,381
<i>Date my daughter!</i>

923
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,315
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE BEHIND THE SCENES
OF <i>DATE MY DAUGHTER!</i>

924
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,012
Ow! Ouch!

925
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,414
A SERIOUS KICK!

926
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,819
Show this in the bloopers.

927
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,455
TAIYAKI

928
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,071
You all have the expression of a parent.

929
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,872
YOU ALL HAVE THE EXPRESSION OF A PARENT.

930
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,774
We're so sorry.

931
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,842
You told them?

932
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,477
<i>Will this love last?</i>

933
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,678
<i>We're the strongest!</i>

934
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,181
<i>I'm scared of him hating me.</i>
<i>I can't be honest.</i>

935
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,449
<i>A story of a mom and a daughter.</i>

936
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:26,383
I want to see it.

937
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,819
<i>A Blood type O can't have</i>
<i>a Blood type AB kid.</i>

938
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,887
<i>We'll always be a mom and daughter.</i>

939
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:31,788
