1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,236
Today's guest is

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,806
the actor starring in <i>Date My Daughter!</i>
or DMD as Soseki Tachibana,

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,175
it's Yoohei Kawakami!

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,078
He's very popular.
We're getting many comments.

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,715
-"Who is he?" "Where is he from?"
-Not at all.

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,851
-"I'd like to take him home."
-No, no.

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,886
Though you're not as popular as me.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,554
-I believe.
-Yes, of course.

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,089
-That's a given.
-Changing topics.

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,691
I hear you're actually a singer.

11
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:25,592
An artist?

12
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,726
Yes, that's true.

13
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,461
It's your first time acting?

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,063
Yes.

15
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,700
It was my first time acting
so I was very nervous.

16
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,301
But the cast members

17
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,338
and the staff were all very kind.

18
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,639
-So…
-Wow, so wonderful!

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,341
Yes.

20
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,876
Changing topics,

21
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,444
you're a singer, right?

22
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,513
-And the group you're a part of…
-Yes.

23
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,680
-A band, you call it?
-Yes.

24
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,882
Alec-sandros.

25
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,417
What sort of songs do you sing?

26
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,219
-It's "Alexandros."
-Oh.

27
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,120
With an X.

28
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,156
-Oh my, sorry about that.
-Not a problem.

29
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,858
-I'm not caught up on the latest trends.
-Not at all.

30
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,227
-I used to host <i>Best Ten</i> back in the day.
-Oh.

31
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,395
You probably don't know.

32
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,130
-Of course I know.
-Oh?

33
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,199
-I used to watch it with my mom a lot.
-Oh?

34
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,736
You know this song, right?
It's called "Wind Wind."

35
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,906
<i>Become the wind! Become the wind!</i>

36
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,042
<i>We become the wind, wind!</i>

37
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,945
Wow, you're really bad at singing.

38
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,448
You sing, then.

39
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,982
Can I?

40
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,651
-Then…
-You brought your guitar.

41
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,885
Excuse me for a minute.

42
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,721
-I'll sing it, acoustic style.
-Sure.

43
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,291
<i>Become the wind</i>

44
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,992
-<i>Become the wind</i>
-<i>Become the wind</i>

45
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,597
-<i>We let the wind carry us</i>
-<i>We become the wind, wind!</i>

46
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,801
-<i>Become the wind</i>
-<i>Become the wind</i>

47
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,805
-<i>Become…</i>
-<i>Become…</i>

48
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,041
<i>Be…</i>

49
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,781
Good work today. Thank you.

50
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,683
I became an editor

51
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,419
because I loved

52
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,855
<i>Don't Forget Me.</i>

53
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,390
I joined Saneisha because I wanted to be

54
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,127
Aoi Minase's editor.

55
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,396
Why do you say that now?

56
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,299
I was going to keep it a secret.

57
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,246
Idiot.

58
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,928
What are you doing?

59
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,133
What are you doing to my mom?

60
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,607
That was otterly weird. Get otter here!

61
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,710
I won't say childish things
like that anymore.

62
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,146
I'm 20. I'm an adult.

63
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,515
You've got it wrong, Sora?

64
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,185
How am I wrong?

65
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,452
How are you wrong?

66
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,821
I'm sorry! I overstepped the boundary.

67
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,724
Something was wrong with me.
I didn't mean it!

68
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,194
You didn't mean it?

69
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,763
That's my Limoncello.

70
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,165
I bought it with my own part-time money.

71
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,099
I'll buy you more.

72
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,570
It's from Meidi-ya in Hiroo.

73
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,175
Mom, this is bad! Sally!

74
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,577
What if Sally finds out?

75
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,812
You're right! This is bad!

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
You might be safe, Mom,
but she'll burn down our house!

77
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,516
No need to worry about that.

78
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,320
Sally's been cold lately.

79
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,354
She doesn't come home.

80
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,956
-What?
-Huh?

81
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,892
That's enough about me.

82
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,094
I don't know what I was thinking.

83
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,196
I swear something like this will

84
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,331
never happen again!

85
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,400
Oh, sure.

86
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,138
<i>He swore.</i>

87
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,374
<i>He swore it.</i>

88
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,577
<i>He swore that</i>

89
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,051
<i>something like that</i>
<i>will never happen again.</i>

90
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,556
HIBERNATING, DO NOT DISTURB

91
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,729
I felt like my mom was being
taken away from me.

92
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,230
I see.

93
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,065
Am I a child?

94
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,767
You are her child.

95
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,141
It's nice to lean on your mom like that.

96
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,543
I'm not doing that.

97
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,079
I was just surprised, that's all.

98
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,618
So what should we do with the title?

99
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,121
-The title, huh?
-Yeah.

100
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,523
<i>Another World?</i>

101
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,058
So typical.

102
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,029
Right?
Your mom's so cool. She has good taste.

103
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,765
-As expected of a professional.
-Huh?

104
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,635
Like her most recent series,
<i>Umbilical Cord.</i>

105
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,904
So cool!

106
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,707
It got canceled, though.

107
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,812
Speaking of, what does
"umbilical cord" mean?

108
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,047
No way! You don't know?

109
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,282
I'm a manga otaku. I don't read books.

110
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,851
Only comics. I've never read Mom's books.

111
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,220
It means "navel string."

112
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,090
Oh, cool. That sounds deep.

113
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,626
Hey, with Jadwiga,

114
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,663
can we make her boobs bigger?

115
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,965
-Just a little bit?
-No.

116
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,868
You don't understand, Minase.

117
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,271
-For men, boobs are everything.
-No.

118
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,213
We're so sorry about this.

119
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,549
What? Wait.

120
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,616
Huh?

121
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,053
You told him what happened?
You told Konishi?

122
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,255
What do you mean?

123
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,028
I'm here to apologize about
the series of events

124
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,631
with <i>Don't Forget Me…</i>

125
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,034
Oh, that one!

126
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,635
I see.

127
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,304
What else is there?

128
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,407
No, don't worry about it.

129
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,311
We got a little too excited about

130
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,279
a big budget film.

131
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,448
We messed up.

132
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,486
We'll follow the original text.
Naoko, the heroine, will die.

133
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,688
They'll rewrite the whole script.

134
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,223
We also made sure

135
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,426
that Yuto understands that as well.

136
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,428
Yeah. Thanks.

137
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,164
This is to apologize for the mess.

138
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,466
No.

139
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,136
-Are you flustered?
-No.

140
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,937
-Are you hiding something?
-Nope!

141
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,672
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

142
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,876
You said "no" eight times.

143
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,646
Whatever.

144
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,382
I won't get involved
in your private lives.

145
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,784
What do you mean?

146
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,554
Why did you say that? If you won't
get involved, don't say anything!

147
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,089
That's why everyone hates you!

148
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,657
There's nothing going on.

149
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,125
Not one bit.

150
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,332
I wanted to discuss something,
but I have my next appointment.

151
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,035
Tachibana will talk to you about it.

152
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,838
Alright.

153
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,713
I thought you brought the bean jelly
from Tatsuya to apologize for the kiss.

154
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,317
Though we didn't kiss.

155
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,353
Should I have brought some?

156
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,789
Two is too much.

157
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:40,993
Oh.

158
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,030
This is Sora's Limoncello.

159
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:44,964
Oh.

160
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,105
Now, everything's back to normal.

161
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,644
It's because I cried. I'm sorry.

162
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,816
Konishi was going to talk about

163
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,785
your next book, Ms. Minase.

164
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,891
Why won't you call me Ms. Aoi?

165
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,361
I apologize for being too friendly.

166
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,398
It was proof of me acting
too friendly with you.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,770
We have to decide on what book to release
next year by the end of February.

168
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,975
At this point, I can't write
the proposal for

169
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,643
your next book.

170
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,714
Even a title will be helpful.

171
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,451
Stop acting so professional.

172
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,388
It feels like you're leaving me alone.

173
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,858
It feels like you're
stepping away from me.

174
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:52,265
Should I come closer to you, then?

175
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,839
Just a bit.

176
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,809
The moderate distance.

177
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,626
Don't drink too much.

178
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,929
Gon-chan, I'm stressed about work!

179
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,365
I need to have an idea soon,
or Saneisha won't publish my next book!

180
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,434
They set a deadline for the proposal.

181
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,436
It's like I'm climbing 13 steps at once!

182
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,906
I thought you were writing
a romance novel. No ideas yet?

183
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,076
I can't write romance! I got dumped again.

184
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,512
Again?

185
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,515
Who was it this time?
They all have great taste in women, huh?

186
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,687
The heavy weight of Tatsuya's bean jellies
put distance between us.

187
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,488
Same with me.

188
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,992
I got rejected with bean jellies
from Tatsuya. Love is over.

189
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,062
When Aoba declined
my arranged marriage proposal,

190
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,531
the aunties brought Tatsuya bean jellies.

191
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,800
-We're so sorry!
-What am I supposed to do with that?

192
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,635
We're a <i>taiyaki</i> shop here!

193
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,137
Wait, Gon-chan, you got rejected?

194
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:11,344
Rejected, huh? You poor thing!

195
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,915
Don't pity me! Think about it.
I'm not suited for marriage.

196
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:20,086
I'm cooler when I'm alone.
I thrive in solitude. And I'm the idol

197
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,389
for girls who come to see me
with the pretense of buying <i>taiyaki!</i>

198
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,093
-What an old idol you are! No way!
-Who are you calling old?

199
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,028
-Gon-chan.
-Yeah?

200
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,330
-Something's been bothering me lately.
-What?

201
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,766
-You know how I shake around my head?
-Yeah.

202
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,801
You've got it wrong, Sora!

203
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,038
-Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
-Whenever I do that.

204
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,906
It makes the bottom of my face jiggle

205
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,175
slower than the top of my face.
There's a time lag.

206
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,145
-My face shakes slower at the bottom!
-What?

207
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,046
You try too!

208
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,950
-It's shaking!
-Of course!

209
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,219
Do you have a mirror? I want to check.

210
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,187
Here it is.

211
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,190
Here.

212
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,660
Wait.

213
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,529
-Maybe you shouldn't do this.
-Why?

214
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,899
Because it's obviously a sign of aging!

215
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,301
You're getting blubbery around here.
There's more fat.

216
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,570
It means you're gaining weight.

217
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,107
-You're right.
-Yup.

218
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,275
Oh.

219
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,079
Mirror, mirror. Who's the most handsome
man of all?

220
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,314
It's Gon-chan, of course!

221
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,016
I'll poison your apple.

222
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,152
Gon-chan! I'm done with the delivery!

223
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,053
Good work.

224
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,754
You're here, Mom?

225
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,257
-I was drinking.
-Yeah, I can tell.

226
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,894
Try this, Sora. Shake your face like this.

227
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,831
-It's not jiggling.
-It's not!

228
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,400
Shake faster. Like this.

229
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,538
-It doesn't jiggle!
-It doesn't jiggle!

230
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,607
Wow. Youth is an amazing thing.

231
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,875
What's going on?

232
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,812
Hey, Sora. We're done today. Good work.

233
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,048
Sora, you come and drink with us too.
This is good.

234
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,185
You too, Gon-chan. Heal the pain
of lost love with alcohol.

235
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,220
I can't get drunk today.

236
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,655
What? Why?

237
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,591
Wait, you're dressed up today.
You have plans?

238
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,893
Excuse me.

239
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,764
Shunichiro called. He's almost here.

240
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,667
-Kenta. Can you wipe this table?
-Yes!

241
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,837
-Give me that tray.
-Here.

242
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,139
-Alright. I'm putting this away.
-Wait! Why? I'm drinking this!

243
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,241
I want to clean you up too! We have

244
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,309
an important guest.

245
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,810
An important guest?

246
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,045
Dad said all of a sudden,

247
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,747
he wants to introduce us to someone.

248
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,048
What?

249
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,083
His girlfriend, right?

250
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,119
Shunichiro's girlfriend!

251
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,253
A shock, right?

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,321
I noticed it.

253
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,324
He always asks me to take photos. He says,

254
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,326
"Make me look handsome."

255
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,161
When I took the nose hair pic too.

256
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,863
It was probably for his girlfriend.

257
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,434
I never noticed!

258
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,637
You never notice. You're always
only thinking about yourself…

259
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,874
Ouch! According to my speculations,

260
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,110
Shunichiro's a pretty handsome guy, right?

261
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,515
He'll probably bring a traditional
Japanese beauty, like Sayuri Yoshinaga.

262
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,084
Someone like that would suit
Shunichiro so much!

263
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,820
Right? Okay, listen.

264
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,256
I may be meeting
my future stepmother today.

265
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,091
I can't get drunk today!

266
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,392
It's that serious?

267
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,728
I'm not sure, but he's bringing her
all the way here…

268
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,196
I'm home!

269
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,437
I'm home.

270
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,807
What? Everyone's here?

271
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,041
Oh, yes.

272
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,813
-Come in, Sally!
-Huh?

273
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,016
Hello.

274
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,351
She's my lover, Saori Itoh.

275
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,390
Hi.

276
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,860
"Sally" is that "Sally"?

277
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,062
How old are you, exactly?

278
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,231
I'm 23.

279
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,906
<i>LONG LOST LOVE</i>

280
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,910
<i>PARADISE LOST</i> - JUNICHI WATANABE

281
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,412
<i>UNTIL THIS LIFE ENDS</i>

282
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,148
<i>THE END OF THIS LOVE</i>

283
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,520
What is love?

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,121
Don't tell him!

285
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,289
What?

286
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,527
Please. I need to tell him myself.

287
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,096
Soseki doesn't know?

288
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,231
Not yet.

289
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,501
Does Shunichiro know that
you dated Soseki?

290
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,403
He knows everything.

291
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,205
Okay.

292
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,646
With these things, timing is everything.

293
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,718
I stopped coming home, calling him

294
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,053
and tracking his phone location.

295
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,855
Once he starts getting the hint,

296
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,392
that's when I break it to him.

297
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,828
If I tell him before, he'll get pissed.

298
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,696
It would be dramatic!

299
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,398
Which step are you in now?

300
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,034
Around the "the" of

301
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,671
"getting the hint."

302
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,875
People start giving up
with the passing of time.

303
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,545
You're so experienced, Sally.

304
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,949
It's a big shock
when you hear it from others.

305
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,351
Don't tell him, please!

306
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,889
I understand. I'm a romance beginner,
I'll do what you say.

307
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,726
Good girl.

308
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,800
But you loved him so much.

309
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,305
You know,

310
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,041
I want to be happy.

311
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:43,976
What?

312
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,078
I'm sure you know, Sora.

313
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,749
<i>But when I'm with Soseki,</i>
<i>I turn into a crazy stalker.</i>

314
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,518
<i>I felt only pain.</i>

315
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,354
<i>That's not happy love.</i>

316
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,125
But when I'm with Shunichiro,

317
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,428
I'm not in pain.

318
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,598
I feel soft and fluffy,

319
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,301
like I'm sleeping on top of a cloud.

320
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,640
But isn't love supposed to be painful?

321
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,176
That's my guess, at least.

322
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,844
What?

323
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,248
In that case, Soseki will be single.

324
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,117
He could date Mom now!

325
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,620
What the hell! Is that what's happening?

326
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:33,258
Your voice sounded a bit rough there.
Don't burn our house down, okay?

327
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,260
Oh, right.

328
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,130
I'll find my own happiness.

329
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,332
I don't care about Soseki anymore.

330
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>If this love is over</i>

331
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,005
<i>It's like it never existed</i>

332
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,339
Alright.

333
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,979
-Excuse me, can I get another?
-Yes.

334
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,415
Could I?

335
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,784
I'll have the same.

336
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,952
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,323
I'll call Mom. She'll worry.

338
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,528
You and your mom are so close.

339
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,797
It's normal, right?

340
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,933
You don't know.

341
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,771
You think all mothers and daughters
are like you guys.

342
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,773
Am I wrong?

343
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,376
I have a really toxic mom.

344
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,682
She's so terrible.

345
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,520
Maybe it's my mom's fault that I chase men

346
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,321
all the time.

347
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,760
Ever since I was little,

348
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,863
I never felt loved by my mom.

349
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,267
Not even once.

350
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,202
Really?

351
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,939
I…

352
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,911
I can't trust women.

353
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,613
I don't need women in my life.

354
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,253
You should trust women.

355
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,723
I'm sure there are women you can trust.

356
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,261
In that case,

357
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,299
can I trust you?

358
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,367
Sure.

359
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,037
Will you be my friend?

360
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,907
If you'll have me.

361
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,054
I see. You became friends?

362
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,689
Yeah.

363
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,658
-That's a great thing.
-Yeah.

364
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,561
Everyone has their issues, huh?

365
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,132
They do? Is that what you talked about?

366
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,702
Issues with her family.

367
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,970
Oh, that?

368
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,907
We're happy.

369
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,145
<i>If this love is over</i>

370
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,949

371
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,221
<i>A brooch that lost its clasp</i>

372
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,991

373
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,059
That's what she said.

374
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,761
Sally was singing that.

375
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,332
Love ends, huh?

376
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,835
Yeah.

377
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,406
Maybe it's beautiful because it ends.

378
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,075
But…

379
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,916
Parent-and-kid relationships don't end.

380
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,519
And friendships don't end.

381
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,691
Relationships that don't end are nice.

382
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,762
What if you get married?

383
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,630
Then men and women don't end either.

384
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,333
One in three couples get divorced.

385
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,771
But we don't hear one in three children
cutting off ties with their parents.

386
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,706
I see.

387
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,942
We're the strongest!

388
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,743

-Ouch!
-A Sleeper Hold!

390
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,715
I yield!

391
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,751
What's wrong? Why are you this energetic?

392
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,291
I have my date tomorrow.
I'm so nervous, I'll go crazy!

393
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,094
I'm so scared that I want to
throw an uppercut!

394
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,462
Stop it!

395
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,264
Oh, with Doctor Wataru?

396
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,733
A real date, without nose hair.

397
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,403
Will you go on another date with me?

398
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,773
The date you won back from him!

399
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,542
I'm so nervous, I can't sleep!

400
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,646
Mom, go on the date for me!

401
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,780
That's impossible.

402
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,849
I'm so pathetic!

403
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,018
You're not pathetic!

404
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,921
I'm the most proud of you.

405
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,724
You're the best daughter in the world!

406
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,125

407
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,194
Be confident, Sora!

408
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,230
When you were born, I almost gave you

409
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,765
The Cutest In The World Award!

410
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,267
What is that?

411
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,637
Before that, The Cutest
In The World Award was mine.

412
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,406
Two generations of award winners!

494
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,609
Hello?

495
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,714
Why do you sound like
the person you hate most called you?

496
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,549
Well, you're not wrong.

497
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:33,652
Should I hang up?

498
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,121
-I'm on my date.
-What?

499
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,689
My date!

500
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,861
Is it going well?

501
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,362
Very well.

502
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:45,697
<i>I see.</i>

503
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,599
<i>Don't mess up.</i>

504
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,168
What did you want to talk about?

505
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,070
I'll tell you later.

506
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,776
Whatever.

507
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,982
I thought it would be cute

508
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,552
if we put ears on Jadwiga.

509
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,956
I'm so bad at drawing!

510
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,263
Shunichiro's been peppy again

511
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,866
since this morning.
He has a date with Sally.

512
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,635
No one says "peppy" anymore!

513
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,205
If I keep talking to you, I can
never write anything modern!

514
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,641
He's been changing outfits
since this morning.

515
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,743
He went through so many.

516
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,784
Asking, "Which one makes me look
the most handsome?"

517
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,620
But she was really cute.

518
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:46,725
I totally lost to him. Even if I could
marry Aoba, she's 26.

519
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,027
-Sally's 23!
-23.

520
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,362
And you didn't marry Aoba.

521
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,397
Geez.

522
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,866
That doesn't matter.

523
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,601
I heard from Dad.

524
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,004
She was originally
your editor's girlfriend, right?

525
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,905
Yes.

526
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,808
-Then, she switched over to Dad.
-Yup.

527
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,543
It was impressive.

528
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,945
Is she okay?

529
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,613
What do you mean?

530
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,617
You know, for example… Could she be…

531
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,019
after the money?

532
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,056
No, I don't think so at all.

533
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,424
She's not the type.

534
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,192
You think?

535
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,661
You want assurance
that everything will work out.

536
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,864
-But I'm not so sure.
-What?

537
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,133
Sally lives for love.

538
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,401
I hope Shunichiro won't get squeezed out.

539
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,469
Of money?

540
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,005
Of his power to live.

541
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,841
I didn't know that could be squeezed out.

542
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:37,742
Is she a witch?

543
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,377
Oh, how about this?

544
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,113
Romance between a girl
in her early twenties starving for love,

545
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,582
and an old man at the end of his life.

546
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,085
In the end, they end their lives together.

547
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,522
-While eating duck hot pot.
-Hey, you. Don't kill my dad!

548
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,625
-I'm just joking.
-Geez.

549
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,863
So Sora's on her date, huh?

550
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,166
She grew up fast.

551
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,034
Yeah.

552
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,068
Aoi.

553
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,039
You love Sora. You should write about her
for your novel.

554
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,642
That's a love story too.
A story about love.

555
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,844
About Sora? How?

556
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,913
She doesn't ask who the dad is?

557
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,314
Yeah.

558
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,117
When she does, I use my imagination.

559
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,120
I tell her he's a super famous celebrity,
or an Arab aristocrat.

560
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,788
Or, I say, he wasn't Japanese!

561
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,424
Is that the right response as a parent?

562
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,026
Sora likes it too.

563
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,594
You guys are weird.

564
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,832
When she was little,
that Zojirushi was her dad.

565
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,935
She doesn't ask me anymore.

566
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,437
She's probably no longer interested.

567
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,275
You'll never tell her?

568
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,780
I'll tell her one day.

569
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,782
Not yet. Not now.

570
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,521
Oh! I have an idea!

571
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,455
What?

572
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,558
I have an idea for the novel!

573
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,627
-Sorry, Gon-chan, go home.
-Huh?

574
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,329
-I can't work with you around.
-What?

575
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,563
Sorry. Go home.

576
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,466
Sorry for making you walk.

577
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,467
It's fine.

578
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,337
What should we eat tonight?

579
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:14,873
What?

580
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,641
If you go eat Italian,

581
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,977
have tiramisu for dessert.
Tiramisu and strawberries

582
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,846
are a cute girl's food!

583
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,415
Tiramisu.

584
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,651
Tiramisu?

585
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,120
Or strawberries.

586
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,922
That's dessert.

587
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,493
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Okay.

588
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,099
Let me think.

589
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,734
I don't know.

590
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,470
I don't think it matters.

591
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,071
That won't work!

592
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,308
"I don't care" is the worst answer.
I read that online!

593
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,777
That's true.

594
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,579
Hey, why are you calling me?

595
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,183
Mom turns off her phone
when she's writing.

596
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,853
I'm second to Mom, huh?

597
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:03,922
Do you like that?

598
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:04,889
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

599
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,624
Wait, don't! Tell me!

600
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,763
Extra-large katsudon.

601
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,598
That's what you want!

602
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,566
<i>With extra pickled ginger…</i>

603
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,368
Wait, that's gyudon.

604
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,949
This is pretty good.

605
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,995
This is so good!

606
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,998
-Are you sure this is fine?
-Huh?

607
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,767
I was planning to take you to
a French restaurant or something.

608
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,336
But that's greasy.

609
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:55,039
I love your red bean soup
more than anything.

610
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:00,845
How nice! You two love each other.
How wholesome.

611
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,313
-We went out.
-Yes?

612
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,015
To an aquarium together.

613
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,351
-Wow!
-We got you a gift.

614
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:07,885
Really?

615
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm home!

616
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,322
-Welcome home!
-It's getting cold.

617
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,890
Oh!

618
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,359
Here's your future mom!

619
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,727
What?

620
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,463
I'm just kidding!

621
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,032
Shunichiro.

622
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:21,966
I'm fine with that.

623
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:22,967
No.

624
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,370
Sally, you're in your early twenties!

625
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,940
He's a senior citizen.
You're really fine with that?

626
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,142
Hey, Mr. Gon-chan?

627
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,443
Mr. Gon-chan?

628
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,513
I thought Gon-chan was too friendly.

629
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,948
Don't say that!

630
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,051
Just call him Gon.
Honestly, "Go" is enough.

631
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:40,952
"Gon-chan," please.

632
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,188
In that case, Gon-chan.

633
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,358
What are you smiling about?

634
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,529
You know, ever since I met Shunichiro,

635
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,597
I can sleep.

636
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,067
I can sleep really well at night,

637
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,537
and the world feels warmer.

638
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,674
I feel safe now.

639
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,777
I feel safe that I'm alive.

640
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,747
That you're alive? That's deep.

641
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,720
I felt like the ground was always
shaking beneath me.

642
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,456
But now, I'm alright.

643
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,458
I see.

644
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,894
I found an apartment,

645
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,963
and I found a new job too.

646
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,434
Shunichiro, you rented
that apartment, right?

647
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,971
You can pay me back whenever.

648
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,142
I'll work and pay you back.

649
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,248
I took a look.

650
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,917
What do you think?

651
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,120
I think it's great!

652
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,357
I wrote it in two hours.

653
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,126
That's impressive.

654
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,463
I just wrote the main plot.
I had the idea during the day.

655
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,199
This is about a mother
and daughter, right?

656
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,801
Right. That's the problem.

657
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,903
It's not a romance novel.

658
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,206
<i>Let's pitch this.</i>

659
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,107
What?

660
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,676
I'll make sure this pitch goes through.

661
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,811
I want to read this novel

662
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,913
more than anyone!

663
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:25,823
Try it on.

664
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,426
-What?
-That hat.

665
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,399
It's cute.

666
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,568
Huh?

667
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,237
Can I buy it for you?

668
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,506
Huh?

669
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,442
No.

670
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,444
I don't need it.

671
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,312
32,600 YEN

672
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,983
Can you wait a second?

673
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,787
It's a designer brand. I'm going to go
withdraw some money at the ATM.

674
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,222
No, I don't want it.

675
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,628
You calling me cute, that was enough.

676
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,532
It made me happy.

677
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,670
To be honest,

678
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,607
I'm not used to going on dates with girls.

679
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,010
Yeah.

680
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,979
So I don't know about how much
money to spend. I'm sorry.

681
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,215
It's fine.

682
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,150
I'm bad at rowing the swan boat too.

683
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,686
I asked you to do that.

684
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,689
But the next spot is pretty good.

685
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,492
My <i>senpai</i> took me there once.

686
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,841
You said tiramisu and strawberries.
So I chose Italian.

687
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,345
What a pretty restaurant.
I didn't know about this place.

688
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,350
What should we get? We don't need to
get a course. We can get à la carte.

689
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,752
It's pretty affordable.

690
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,487
So don't worry…

691
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,192
What's wrong, Sora?

692
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,763
My stomach hurts.

693
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,031
What?

694
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,667
Are you okay?

695
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,571
I'm sorry. I can walk on my own.

696
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,707
Should we get a taxi?

697
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,343
I might get sick.

698
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,913
Sorry for making you drink.

699
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,214
It's fine.

700
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,753
Here.

701
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:37,822
What?

702
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,657
We're not far from TaiyouDo.

703
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,260
-No.
-It's fine.

704
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,062
I'm not tall for nothing. Come.

705
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,734
This is embarrassing.

706
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,269
Not the time to be embarrassed.

707
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,537
What are we doing at TaiyouDo?

708
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,139
Leave it to me.

709
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,241
Right. You're a chiropractor.

710
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,377
I'm a professional.

711
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,346
To tell you the truth,

712
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,250
my stomach was hurting a little
the whole time.

713
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,785
You should've told me!

714
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,722
I was nervous for my very first date

715
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,190
in my life.

716
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,663
You're not counting the nose hair date
from the other day?

717
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,633
Sorry.

718
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,836
TAIYOUDO

719
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,376
Sorry about this.

720
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,083
I'm even more nervous now.

721
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,821
Forget that it's me. Pretend I'm your mom.

722
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,098
<i>Mom's patting was so fast.</i>

723
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,068
It wasn't really relaxing.

724
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,135
What?

725
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,404
If I knew this would happen,

726
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,041
I would've asked you to wear
the nose hair again.

727
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,247
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath and relax.

728
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,431
You're right. It doesn't hurt
as much anymore.

729
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,102
Right? I may not look it,
but I'm pretty good.

730
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,239
I know.

731
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,174
Everyone in town comes here.

732
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,510
You can sleep.

733
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,712
Yeah.

734
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,086
Sorry about the Italian restaurant.

735
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,021
Don't worry about that.

736
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,726
I'm sorry for not noticing
that your stomach hurt.

737
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:56,827
I'm not very observant.

738
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,334
Sora, your phone is ringing.

739
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,671
Can you pick up, Doctor Wataru?

740
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,141
It might be my mom.

741
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,979
Hello?

742
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,949
Oh… What?

743
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,552
Who is it? Sora's busy right now.

744
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,756
Oh, it's nothing! I'm sorry to bother you.

745
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,432
TOP 20 PERFECT RESTAURANTS
FOR YOUR FIRST DATE

746
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,437
CHIROPRACTOR: TAIYOUDO

747
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,242
Um…

748
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:51,148
With this mess, there's probably
not a second date, right?

749
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,931
That's my line.

750
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,600
I put you in this mess.

751
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,304
And you'll still try with me again
next time?

752
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,143
I'll bring pain killers next time!

753
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,383
I won't bring my nose hair next time.

754
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,185
I want to bring my natural self.

755
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,259
And two weeks passed after that.

756
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,962
It sounded like you two would meet
the next day.

757
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,898
Right? I thought that too.

758
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,701
But then, they had sports day
at Nagaiki Home…

759
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,202
"Nagaiki Home"?

760
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,638
A senior care center close by.

761
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,943
The old people fought hard!

762
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,947
They wore their bodies out.
So now, TaiyouDo,

763
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,884
Doctor Wataru's clinic, is really popular!

764
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,919
He's really busy now.

765
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,421
But you're texting him, right?

766
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,324
I am. I am, but…

767
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,593
I can't breathe if he doesn't respond.

768
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,528
Wow.

769
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,796
My chest gets tight
just from seeing bunnies on TV.

770
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,431
-Bunnies?
-Yeah.

771
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,134
Oh, Doctor Nose Hair's
elementary school promise!

772
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,736
Don't call him that!

773
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,337
Sorry.

774
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:24,074
-I want my racing heart to die!
-Okay.

775
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,743
I can only sleep at night.

776
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:26,677
So you are sleeping!

777
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,413
-I don't know who I am anymore!
-Oh.

778
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,516
I can't tell him the truth
because I don't want him to hate me.

779
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,018
I haven't told him that I'm an otaku.

780
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,220
I can feel myself shrinking.

781
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,989
Draw, Minase!

782
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,624
What?

783
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,793
When you're drawing, you're free.

784
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,362
You won't be tied down by love.

785
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,637
-I'll draw!
-Draw!

786
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,540
Are Jadwiga's ears like this?

787
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,776
-A bit bigger.
-Okay.

788
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,245
-Welcome! To go?
-Yes.

789
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:05,249
Hey. I think we should change places.

790
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,017
Wanna come over?

791
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,986
Really?

792
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,487
Totally fine.

793
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:16,193
-Welcome! Come in, come on!
-Thank you for having me.

794
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,630
I'm so happy Sora finally
started drawing manga, thanks to you!

795
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,864
It's just a hobby.

796
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,032
Whatever you say.

797
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,901
You know,

798
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,438
I want to relax in the living room.

799
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,241
Can you work in your room?
Keep the door open though.

800
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,543
So nothing happens.

801
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,445
Nothing will happen.

802
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,446
Never.

803
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,581
So… Irino, right?

804
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,783
I'm Hikaru Irino.

805
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,387
What a beautiful name.
Your names mean sky and light.

806
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,889
How bright!

807
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,591
Your names glitter together!

808
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,026
We don't use first names.

809
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,728
We use last names, Mother.

810
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,465
What a waste. I picked a great name
for you, Sora.

811
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,468
Hikaru got his beautiful name
from his parents too!

812
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,537
SANEISHA KONISHI

813
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,306
Oh, this is about work.

814
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,175
I'll be in my writing room.

815
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,344
Make yourself at home.

816
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:11,582
You can drink tea here. Help yourself!

817
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,987
I was starting to pick up on it,

818
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,657
but your mom is very free-spirited.

819
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,259
That's a nice way of putting it.

820
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,797
Really? You're sure?

821
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,700
Yeah. <i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams.</i>

822
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,137
That's a great title!

823
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:37,007
Your proposal went through.

824
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,809
I'm so happy. I'll write this!

825
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,380
But why are you calling me?
What about Soseki?

826
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,450
I accepted the proposal, so I call you.

827
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,986
That's common sense, isn't it?

828
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,522
You're that type of person, Konishi.

829
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,591
<i>You don't share your achievements.</i>
<i>You ask for gratitude from others.</i>

830
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,530
Tachibana's out today. He has a cold.

831
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,432
Oh?

832
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,434
Blood type?

833
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,669
Yeah. I like to write down the characters'

834
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,971
birthdays and blood types.

835
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,274
I create a character list first.

836
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,943
Some people don't make these, but I do.

837
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,479
Mom probably doesn't make these.

838
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,548
She makes it up on the spot.
She's a Blood type O.

839
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,384
So Aoi Minase is Type O, huh?

840
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,986
Yeah. I'm an outsider, so I'm Type AB.

841
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,388
That makes sense.

842
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,490
I'm Type A.

843
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,460
Makes sense. You're a secret hard worker.

844
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,595
That sounds like a dig!

845
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,864
Sora! I'm going shopping!

846
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,133
I'm getting wine to celebrate!

847
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,968
What are you celebrating?

848
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,038
My proposal for the new novel
got accepted!

849
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,474
Wow, congrats!

850
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,176
Will you dance the happy dance?

851
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,311
Yeah.

852
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,215
Congrats!

853
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,985
Congrats, congrats! Congrats, congrats!

854
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,553
-Congrats, congrats.
-Can I join?

855
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,255
-Congrats, congrats.
-Congrats.

856
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,191
-Congrats, congrats, congrats.
-Congrats, congrats, congrats.

857
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,361
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Congrats, congrats, congrats.

858
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,634
<i>Let's play a throwback song next.</i>

859
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:15,639
<i>Yoshiyuki Ohsawa's "So I Get Lost."</i>

860
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,746
38.5 DEGREES CELSIUS

861
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,188
I DON'T BELIEVE IT AT ALL,
BUT I DIAL THE NUMBER, HOPING…

862
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,960
<i>I want to read this novel</i>

863
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,229
<i>more than anyone!</i>

864
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,919
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. GOODBYE.

865
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:04,988
What is this?

866
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:17,201
BLOOD TYPE: AB

867
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,736
Huh?

868
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,738
I'm sure Mom doesn't make those.

869
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,774
She makes it up on the spot.
She's Blood type O.

870
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,045
I'm an outsider, so I'm Type AB.

871
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:52,236
A Type O can't have a Type AB kid, right?

872
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:01,845
<i>Hello?</i>

873
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,047
It's me.

874
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,717
<i>Did you see what I sent?</i>

875
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,853
Yeah.

876
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,255
<i>So, it's goodbye.</i>

877
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,524
I wasn't enough for you?

878
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,261
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

879
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,038
What will you do with your stuff?

880
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,042
<i>Throw it out. I want everything to be new.</i>

881
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,182
Including the men.

882
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,816
AOI MINASE

883
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,718
DIALING… AOI MINASE

884
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,498
WE'LL SHOW YOU BEHIND THE SCENES OF DMD!

885
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,538
-Shooting.
-Shooting.

886
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,606
Start!

887
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,508
Oh!

888
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,609
Oh! I have my mask on!

889
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,400
-<i>Become the wind</i>
-<i>Become the wind</i>

890
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,005
-<i>Become…</i>
-<i>Become…</i>

891
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,082
JADWIGA

892
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,959
<i>She's not family?</i>

893
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,094
<i>It's weird, right?</i>

894
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,529
<i>Mom's Blood type O. I'm AB.</i>

895
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,830
<i>Maybe you remembered wrong.</i>

896
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,898
<i>I'm going to go check.</i>

897
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,099
Don't let her test it!

898
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,469
<i>I shouldn't have done the blood test!</i>

899
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,437
<i>What should I do?</i>

900
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,006
<i>Sora's leaving me. Sora's going away.</i>

901
