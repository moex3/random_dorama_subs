1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,471
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, GOODBYE

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,106
<i>So, it's goodbye.</i>

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,341
<i>I wasn't enough for you?</i>

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,275
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,292
AOI MINASE

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,795
Hello?

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,064
Hey, Soseki!

8
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,666
I heard you have a cold
and you took the day off.

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,703
<i>I have a slight fever.</i>

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,671
I see.

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,808
I got the news that
the <i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams</i> proposal

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,276
went through.

13
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,646
You pushed it, right? Thank you.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,648
It was nothing.

15
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,751
I was planning to work with it.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,921
<i>-With "Lemon Page…"</i>
-Soseki?

17
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,189
<i>Oh god.</i>

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,660
Soseki?

19
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,395
What's wrong?

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,064
Where are you?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,835
<i>That person isn't family? Strange, right?</i>

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,037
Mom's Blood type O. I'm Type AB.

23
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,373
-Maybe you remember wrong.
-I'm going to go check.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,475
No! Don't let her take the test!

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,678
<i>I shouldn't have tested for my blood type!</i>

26
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,948
<i>What should I do? Sora's leaving me.</i>
<i>Sora's going away.</i>

27
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,684
Must be hard, working this late.

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,319
I'm on my night shift.

29
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,220
I see.

30
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,123
He works for me.

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,758
Oh, yes.

32
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,927
He suddenly got a

33
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,564
105 degree fever at the Kasumigaoka
intersection and couldn't move.

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,399
I took a taxi to go find him

35
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,468
and brought him here.

36
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:42,902
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:44,971
Here she is.

38
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,339
Are you okay, Soseki?

39
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,143
Oh, Konishi-kun.

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,911
Thank you for going to find him.

41
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,048
Alright, then.

42
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,017
I'll leave you two youngsters to it.

43
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,919
Sorry. Not young.

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,788
Bye!

45
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,891
Sorry you had to come all the way here.

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,729
I thought you got in an accident!

47
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,465
Yeah. I thought I died too.

48
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,703
There's something in your hair.

49
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,474
Oh.

50
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,710
It looks like pertya fluff.

51
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,211
Already that time of year, huh?

52
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,055
I'm glad.

53
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,423
What?

54
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,893
You scared me.

55
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,594
Ms. Aoi?

56
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,799
I don't know what I'd do without you.

57
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:48,801
Thank you.

58
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,637
That's not what I mean.

59
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,412
Please… Wait.

60
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,716
Wait a minute.

61
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,784
Huh?

62
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,621
I think I'm going through
a major life event right now!

63
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,423
Such a strong rejection!

64
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,458
I may not get over it, ever!

65
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,694
Am I okay?
Can I continue living like this?

66
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,829
No, I'm saying that right now,

67
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,464
I have a cold. A 105 degree fever.

68
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,133
Oh. You're right.

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,100
I can't make you sick.

70
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,469
-Is that your excuse?
-Why?

71
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,439
Is this workplace harassment?
Sexual harassment?

72
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,840
If so, tell me!

73
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,109
It's neither of those things.

74
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,112
If it was, I'd be very sad.

75
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,984
But Ms. Aoi, you're the type
to kiss people

76
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,588
in the same way you find
a really cute puppy and

77
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,459
can't resist kissing him.

78
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,461
Are you a puppy?

79
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,763
You consider yourself a puppy?
You're that cute?

80
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,099
I'm sorry. My metaphor wasn't appropriate.

81
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,634
I got carried away.

82
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,870
But you do tend to get caught up
in the flow.

83
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,208
Have you thought about
what this might mean in the future?

84
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,910
The future?

85
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:06,980
Well…

86
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,283
I mean… I may not look it,

87
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,719
but I'm a man. A straight one, at that.

88
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,622
I'm currently under the weather

89
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,624
with a cold and all, but still.

90
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,895
The other time,
thanks to Sora coming home,

91
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,867
everything ended without a fuss.

92
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,736
But what if it recurred…

93
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,771
-Recurred?
-Yes, recurred.

94
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
That's the wrong word.

95
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,708
I'm not talking about a disease.

96
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,244
I know what you mean, so go on.

97
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,648
So if it happens again and we kiss,

98
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,450
then I could never turn back.

99
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,590
Do you really like me?

100
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,661
Why are you thinking about it?

101
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,200
If you can't respond right away,
you shouldn't kiss anyone.

102
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,569
But don't you start liking people
after you've kissed them?

103
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,005
Yes. If we kiss, we'd like each other!

104
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,440
It'd be a done deal!

105
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,676
We'd start dating and stuff!

106
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,511
You're so cute!

107
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,213
You're one to speak.

108
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,649
That's how it goes in all your novels!

109
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,218
And you're saying your personal life
is different?

110
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,588
So what are we saying?

111
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,157
I'm saying,

112
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,794
let's put a lid on this. On these vibes.

113
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,961
What?

114
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,463
Let's put a lid on it,

115
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,964
and come back after three months.

116
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,934
Why?

117
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,836
Not a week, or two weeks,

118
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,937
but three months?

119
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005
What?

120
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,208
Are you saying that you're unsure

121
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,544
if you'll feel the same
after that much time?

122
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,950
You're saying you're unsure right now?

123
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,223
I checked in with how I feel just now.

124
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,426
When I saw your chubby little left cheek,

125
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,663
I totally thought I felt something.

126
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,200
But from the front, maybe not so much.

127
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,302
Maybe it's not so bad.

128
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,471
Huh?

129
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,739
Looks aren't everything.

130
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,074
Wait. Sounds like you're saying

131
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,676
I'm ugly?

132
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,511
No, come on! No way!

133
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,347
Please don't assess me.

134
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,617
Let's stop checking how we feel.

135
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,085
It's too fuzzy.

136
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,088
Whatever the answer is, it's scary.

137
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,356
Scary.

138
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,229
Anyways, should we be doing this
right now?

139
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,663
What?

140
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,068
The proposal for your new book
got approved today.

141
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,338
Right! You're right.

142
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,906
<i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams.</i>

143
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,475
And it's not a romance novel.

144
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,843
It's totally new territory.

145
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,312
We have to succeed.

146
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,616
I have to succeed at this too.
It's my last shot.

147
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,017
You're right.

148
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,253
Is now the time for romance?

149
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,854
It's really not.

150
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,657
<i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams</i> is

151
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,592
a story about a mother and daughter.

152
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,028
Romance would be pointless.

153
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:10,930
Pointless…

154
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,633
Yes, you're right. Now's not the time.

155
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,302
I'll work hard on my novel!

156
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,704
For now.

157
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,373
What?

158
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,610
ODAYA

159
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,578
Welcome!

160
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,979
Welcome!

161
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,882
<i>Eventually, Sally started working at Odaya</i>

162
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,984
<i>out of admiration for Shunichiro.</i>

163
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,388
What! Soseki got a 105 degree fever?
And he almost got

164
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,389
into an accident?

165
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,090
You didn't know?

166
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,227
-I didn't know.
-Shit. I told you.

167
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,128
<i>TAIYAKI</i>

168
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,796
We've broken up now.

169
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,098
I thought you were lying about that,

170
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,667
and cheating with Shunichiro.

171
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,502
I'd never do such a…

172
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,004
I might, huh?

173
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,005
Yeah.

174
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,476
But I didn't this time.

175
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,944
"This time"?

176
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,378
I broke it off completely.

177
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,214
I see.

178
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,851
Is Soseki better now?

179
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,252
When did that happen?

180
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,788
What is it?

181
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm stopping your heart

182
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,758
from flying back to Soseki.

183
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,160
I see.

184
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,828
Shunichiro is so old!

185
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,763
What if you kill him of a broken heart?

186
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,432
It's totally fine.

187
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,434
My heart is solid.

188
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,135
Solid as a rock.

189
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,572
-Really?
-I think.

190
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,107
"You think"?

191
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,148
-Hello!
-Oh, hello.

192
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,252
We had a four o'clock meeting planned.

193
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,920
I called her cell too.

194
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,990
Mom started working on a new idea, right?

195
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,491
Once that starts, she can't stop.

196
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,461
She's been writing a ton at Hana Café
on her laptop.

197
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,696
That's what you call a true writer.

198
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,802
-You're in the zone, huh?
-Can you tell?

199
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,237
Wow.

200
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,073
Right now, I could even fly the sky!

201
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,744
Can you listen to my new idea?

202
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,579
It's a story about heaven and this world.

203
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,049
Two stories in two different worlds,
moving forward at the same time.

204
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,884
Wow!

205
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,520
I don't get it, but it sounds fun.

206
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,389
You don't get it?

207
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,290
Wait.

208
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,825
What day of the week is it today?

209
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,527
I think I'm forgetting something.

210
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,496
What is it?

211
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,197
The dentist? The spa?

212
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,668
I didn't bring my phone. Well, whatever!

213
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,003
Can I get something sweet?

214
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,940
The other day, when Mom ran out
in the middle of the night,

215
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,108
yelling out, "Soseki's in trouble!"

216
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,377
I thought you were

217
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,012
already together.

218
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,447
We're not. Nothing's happening.

219
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,016
What? Why?

220
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,518
You're not gonna date Mom?

221
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,287
You won't look after Mom in her old age
instead of me?

222
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,890
She forgot about today too.

223
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,859
Oh, that's unrelated.

224
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,494
She's that kind of person.

225
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,432
When she was young, she called
her boyfriend in the middle of the night

226
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,601
because she had a scary dream,

227
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,369
but when he arrived,

228
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,405
she was fast asleep,
with the door chains on.

229
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,408
He spent the whole night outside,
waiting for morning.

230
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,913
Could I survive that?

231
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,615
You want to?

232
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,918
I'm going to keep observing

233
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,252
how Ms. Aoi feels about me.

234
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,022
That makes me nervous.

235
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,957
Mom's feelings change so often

236
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,827
that they even surprise me,
after all our years together. It shifts

237
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,662
like the high-altitude weather.

238
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,865
I can totally understand that.
That's why I'm worried.

239
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,167
My heart is weak right now too.

240
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,836
I shouldn't act on anything yet.

241
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,672
Your heart is weak?

242
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,309
Oh, Sally's Shunichiro, right?

243
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,211
"Shunichiro"?

244
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,346
-What?
-What?

245
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,883
Who's Shunichiro?

246
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,352
Huh? I'm not sure.

247
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:54,920
A dog?

248
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,257
A small dog we recently got as a pet.

249
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,959
That's his name.

250
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,295
Shunichiro!

251
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,832
Is he out for a walk?

252
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,067
Ah!

253
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,836
This is so good.

254
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,639
Really? That makes me happy.

255
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,409
-Can I have another?
-Coming up!

256
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,210
Shunichiro! Another <i>taiyaki!</i>

257
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,345
Coming right up!

258
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,247
I remember Shunichiro.

259
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,283
He's totally Sally's type.

260
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,951
He's perfect.

261
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,187
Plus she loves dads.

262
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,857
Okay. I'm leaving now.

263
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,559
Right now?

264
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,263
You haven't noticed how dressed up I am?

265
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,166
Why did I change into such nice clothes?

266
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,534
I have a date!

267
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:43,836
It wasn't for me?

268
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,139
I'm a college girl.
You think it was for you?

269
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,674
You're an old man, you know.

270
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,143
That was just like Mom!

271
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,679
This holier-than-thou,
narcissistic attitude!

272
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,648
I was just joking.

273
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,416
A date, okay. I understand.

274
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,353
It's okay, Soseki. Wait for Mom here.

275
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,555
Just like a loyal dog.

276
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,889
Woof!

277
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,358
You scared me.

278
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,128
This is our spare key, just in case.

279
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,665
I fell in love.

280
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,501
-I see.
-You're gonna get dumped again?

281
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,303
Why do you assume that?

282
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,338
Because whenever you fall in love,
you get dumped.

283
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,340
It's a two-in-one set.

284
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,675
That's how it always is.

285
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,576
How rude!

286
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,011
You're like Tora-san, Aoi.

287
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,414
A female Tora-san. He always gets dumped.

288
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,752
"Me, born and raised in Suzuran,
Minato Ward.

289
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,954
Last name Minase, First name Aoi.

290
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,790
People call me… Sakura!"

291
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,559
Wow, that's just like him!

292
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,396
I love those movies.
I wanted to play the heroine, though.

293
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,765
The heroine has to be pretty.

294
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,665
What did you say?

295
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,335
Don't waste food!

296
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,604
I'm eating it.

297
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,674
Wow! So good!

298
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,878
Right? We had some good pouches
for inari sushi.

299
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,780
I simmered it in ginger for a long time.

300
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,382
Don't lie. We got it
from Kitsune-ya next door.

301
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,284
It's good. It doesn't matter.

302
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
Yes, it doesn't matter!

303
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,688
We're in a fuzzy area. A gray zone.

304
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,190
What are you saying?

305
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,658
Gray? The color?

306
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,628
Yes. Not black, not white, but gray.

307
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,164
Not red, not white, but pink.

308
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,299
Not blue, not white, but sky blue.

309
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,168
What's she saying?

310
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,936
I get it.

311
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,738
Love is the most fun

312
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,541
when those questions are unanswered!

313
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,610
See, you get it, Shunichiro!

314
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,180
What's going on? You're having fun
without me.

315
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,482
So who's this next guy?

316
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,319
Someone who shares the same dream.

317
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,421
-Is he from work?
-Yeah.

318
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,191
We have these dates called "meetings"…

319
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,859
Our next one is Wednesday.

320
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,295
Aoi, today's Wednesday.

321
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,430
What? It's still Tuesday, right?

322
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,364
It's Wednesday.

323
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,600
No way!

324
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,970
Shoot! You're right!

325
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,206
My strong and ongoing desire of wanting

326
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,274
an extra day until the deadline

327
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,611
messed with my internal calendar!

328
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,780
Oh!

329
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,615
Ouch!

330
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,383
Thank you, come again!

331
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,820
I WAITED A BIT, BUT I'VE HEADED HOME
SOSEKI

332
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,288
"I waited a bit,

333
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,656
but I've headed home… "

334
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,766
-Come in.
-I'm home.

335
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,668
I got this for you.

336
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,104
Cream puffs from Pop Dip.
We went to Harajuku.

337
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,373
Wow! They have the best custards!

338
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,576
Were you on a date? That's Valentino.

339
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,545
Yup.

340
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,981
How nice to be young!

341
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,282
You can restart any time.

342
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,219
You're eating that now?

343
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,989
It's Pop Dip! You need some nice tea…

344
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,023
I want it now.

345
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,858
And on the bed?

346
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,860
I want to eat it now, on the bed!

347
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,362
Are you a child?

348
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,031
Oh, Soseki was here today.
Did you see him?

349
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,335
He went home.

350
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,940
This is how my life is.

351
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,578
You stepped away from me.

352
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,247
You were going into a spiel.

353
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,753
I'll give you the

354
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,621
half custard, half whipped cream.

355
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,024
Really?

356
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,492
Huh? What is it?

357
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,760
I'll never let you go!

358
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,328
I don't need any more men!

359
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,663
Are you a toxic mother?

360
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,199
You only realized just now?

361
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,735
Burr-burr-burr-bulldog!

362
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,237
BULLDOG

363
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,508
I'll give you the first star

364
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,310
that falls on the ground!

365
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,578
Ouch!

366
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,615
How was your date with Doctor Wataru?

367
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,052
It was really fun.

368
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,120
It was a perfect date.

369
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,557
Wonderful!

370
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,427
I'm so happy you know what love is.

371
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,863
All my emotions are bursting!
I'm going to explode!

372
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,466
That's so nice!

373
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,070
Will you become an adult one day

374
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,439
and leave me?

375
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,344
Mom, I'm already an adult. I'm 20.

376
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,613
-I see. 20 is an adult?
-Yeah.

377
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,317
Would you marry Doctor Wataru?

378
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,553
What? No way!

379
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,922
If that happens, I'll be alone.

380
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,994
That's not true.

381
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,299
Once you really love Doctor Wataru,

382
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,901
you'll forget me.

383
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,505
No, I won't.

384
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,910
I'd never forget you, Mom.

385
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,779
Never in a million years.

386
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,083
I felt like I had to say that,
or Mom would go far away.

387
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,419
I see.

388
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,155
I've never had a boyfriend, so

389
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,057
Mom was always my closest person.

390
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,759
I see.

391
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,195
Are you listening to me?

392
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,264
I'm listening so attentively!

393
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,233
Pay for my second latte, okay?

394
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,570
You love Doctor Wataru

395
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,938
that much?

396
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,610
I held his hand.

397
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,811
I see.

398
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,981
No. It was a handshake to say goodbye.

399
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,716
<i>A long handshake.</i>

400
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,484
<i>Too long for a handshake.</i>

401
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,522
<i>It was hard for either of us to let go.</i>

402
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,959
So it felt like we held hands.

403
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,328
I see.

404
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,633
I'm meeting him again tomorrow.
Tomorrow at six, at Hana Café.

405
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,068
I see.

406
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,403
I'm so nervous!

407
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,839
I'm about to explode.

408
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,709
I've never felt that way,
even after sleeping with them.

409
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,412
-"Sleeping"?
-Yeah.

410
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,415
Oh, right. That.

411
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,855
Will I ever do something like that
with Doctor Wataru?

412
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,623
Why are you panicking?

413
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,159
No.

414
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,464
It was just unexpected.

415
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,001
It's hard to talk to Mom
about these things.

416
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,470
I'm counting on you.

417
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,338
I'll ask you lots of questions.

418
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,041
Seriously?

419
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,778
Now, I'm nervous.

420
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,815
Well, it's only fair.

421
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,084
I'm having you draw.

422
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,720
I draw manga because I want to.

423
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,390
I'm sorry about the way I talked
last time.

424
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,626
You're finally drawing manga, Sora?

425
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,128
It's just a hobby.

426
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,030
Sorry I couldn't say that
we're aiming for <i>Jump.</i>

427
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,632
Wait.

428
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,901
We are?

429
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,103
Yeah. We are.

430
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,539
Let's take our manuscript to <i>Jump!</i>

431
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,040
I looked up how to do that.

432
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,277
You're on fire!

433
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,513
So full of energy.

434
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,182
Is it the power of love?

435
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,520
I thought about it. I figured,

436
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,321
I'm Aoi Minase's daughter after all.

437
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,057
Maybe I do have a talent.

438
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,459
Yeah.

439
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,227
The family blood line is important.

440
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,962
It might be genetic.

441
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,598
Aoi Minase's Blood type O, huh?

442
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,535
Yeah. I'm an outsider, so I'm Type AB.

443
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,702
Thank you.

444
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,604
-It was delicious.
-Hey, let me pay.

445
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,640
Let's split it. You listened to me talk.

446
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:38,143
I just got paid. Let me pay, alright?

447
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,678
Why are you acting all cool?

448
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,846
It's fine.

449
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,914
-It's fine!
-Why?

450
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,917
<i>A Blood type O can't have</i>
<i>a Type AB kid, right?</i>

451
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,319
Welcome!

452
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,788
-Welcome!
-Just you?

453
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,523
-Yes.
-What's your name?

454
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,825
It was something bright…

455
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,994
Watt! Watt, right?
You're Sora's classmate!

456
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,930
I'm Hikaru.

457
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,365
Here you are.

458
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,901
Thank you.

459
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,504
How nice. An all-carb meal?

460
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,673
You're young, so I bet
you don't even gain weight.

461
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,474
Are you training?

462
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,077
No. I did track in high school,

463
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,545
but I don't do anything now.

464
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,082
I see. What a waste.
You should play something!

465
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,617
Um, excuse me?

466
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,353
About Ms. Aoi…

467
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,556
What is Aoi Minase's blood type?

468
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,262
I think she's Type O.

469
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,131
I see. And Sora?

470
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,968
I'm not sure. I've never asked.

471
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,336
Really?

472
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,905
Are you doing a personality test
with blood type?

473
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,440
Is that trending again?

474
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,175
Well, something like that.

475
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,145
Can I bother you for a bit?

476
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,815
-Yes?
-Would you like some?

477
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,883
Japanese Sake. Koubou.

478
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,952
Really?

479
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,793
DAD

480
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,028
Father…

481
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:07,499
Go!

482
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,905
WRITE, SLEEP, EAT, CRY, TEASE SORA, WALK

483
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,974
"Eat."

484
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,978
-Yes?
-Mom, are you hungry?

485
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,714
Bingo! I'm so hungry!

486
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,783
-Uber?
-Uber Eats?

487
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,751
Yeah.

488
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,353
Mom wants to get some fresh air.

489
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,488
I'll go buy something.

490
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:30,422
Okay!

491
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,859
I see. You like her that much, huh?

492
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,827
Yeah. I do.

493
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,130
I really, really, like her.

494
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,632
I really do,

495
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,870
but I don't let that show.

496
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,538
I keep my feelings hidden.

497
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,106
What? Why?

498
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,611
Because I'd get dumped?

499
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,446
No way! You're so handsome.

500
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,182
Right. I'm pretty hot, right?

501
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,719
There are parts of myself I'm hiding,

502
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,388
but at first glance, I'm good-looking.

503
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,259
I understand the struggle
of handsome men entirely.

504
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,660
I totally get it.

505
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,595
You get me?

506
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,965
Well, now, drink up!

507
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,734
-That's my sake.
-Drink up!

508
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,776
Jadwiga is Blood type AB.

509
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,944
DOMINICA, TYPE O

510
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,847
And her mother, Dominica, is Type O.

511
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,283
And the father…

512
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,184
JADWIGA'S FATHER

513
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,020
Oh, weren't there rules on blood types

514
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,055
of parents and kids?

515
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,958
I can't just make it up.

516
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,328
"Blood type."

517
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,367
BLOOD TYPE COMBINATION OF PARENTS AND KIDS

518
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,237
MOTHER: TYPE O

519
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,740
CHILD: TYPE O, A OR B

520
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,209
What?

521
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,479
Thank you for dinner and the sake.

522
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,914
-It was a lot of fun.
-Come again, Watt!

523
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,483
No, it's Hikaru!

524
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,554
SORA MINASE

525
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,557
-Hello? It's Sora.
-Yeah.

526
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,593
<i>Are you free to talk?</i>

527
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,462
Yeah, I can talk.

528
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,065
-I was drawing the manga.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

529
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,135
I thought maybe Jadwiga's a Type B.

530
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,736
Okay.

531
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,540
But then, I wondered what blood type
her mom Dominica would be.

532
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,343
You know blood type combinations?

533
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,912
<i>What blood type you can get</i>
<i>based on your parents' types.</i>

534
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:34,813
OPEN

535
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,384
I saw that you can't get AB children
from a Type O parent.

536
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,487
I just googled it.

537
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,689
No matter the father's blood type,

538
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,692
you can't have an AB child
from an O mother.

539
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,263
-That's true.
-That's weird, right?

540
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,699
My mom's Type O, and I'm Type AB.

541
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,769
I had the same thought the other day.

542
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,706
Maybe you remembered
your blood type wrong, Minase.

543
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,408
Oh…

544
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,078
How did you learn your blood type?

545
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,447
From your mom?

546
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,782
No, it wasn't that.

547
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,085
In high school, I went with a friend
to donate blood.

548
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,455
It said "Type AB" in the corner of
the card.

549
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,690
Maybe you remembered wrong.

550
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,027
I'm not sure about that.

551
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,063
Maybe Mom remembered
her own blood type wrong.

552
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,899
That's possible, from her personality.

553
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,702
That's totally possible.

It's not here.

00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,771
It's the maternity handbook from when
Mom was born.

00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,720
Hey! I was just drunk!

567
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,622
She was so drunk the other day.

568
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,523
That's not true.

569
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,125
Her eyes were like this.

570
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,761
Huh? What is it?

571
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,728
I need Irino.

572
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,230
What is it?

573
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,132
Look, he's already standing up.

574
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,501
He's so enthusiastic to talk to her!

575
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,002
She was Type O.

576
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,438
Mom was Type O.

577
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,676
I see.

578
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,811
I'm going to test

579
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,380
what my blood type is now.

580
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,683
I'm going to go confirm that the Type AB

581
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,085
that I tested from the blood drive

582
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,221
that lured me in with
coffee milk was correct.

583
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,326
You don't have to make me laugh now.

584
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,528
Which part was funny?

585
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,863
The coffee milk.

586
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,668
You laugh too easily, Irino.

587
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,770
I'm not laughing, but…

588
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,775
I don't know, maybe you were trying
to make me laugh.

589
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,778
The position of my maternity handbook

590
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,513
that I always put in here changed!

591
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,782
It's always under the passport.

592
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,584
And my drawer keys

593
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,754
should be in this glass, but it was
in the glass next to it.

594
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,923
Why do you just

595
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,292
leave these out where anyone can see?

596
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,228
Sora never touched these things before.

597
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,262
Oh boy…

598
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,966
Oh, it's Dad. He got worried, so he came.

599
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,801
What about Odaya?

600
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,704
What are you worried about at such a time?

601
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,873
It's open, Dad!

MEIJI GENERAL HOSPITAL

603
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,044
You know…

604
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,512
What?

605
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,381
Maybe we should attend the Keynes seminar.

606
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,150
Professor Satonaka's strict
about attendance.

607
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,219
It's fine. It's just once.

608
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,023
If you don't feel like going to
the hospital,

609
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,226
we can go somewhere else. I'll join you.

610
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,229
Like where?

611
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,864
Anywhere you want.

612
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,333
The movies, or Disneyland.

613
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,071
We're not going to Disneyland right now.

614
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,606
Then, we could go bowling.

615
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,196
With Jadwiga,

616
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,865
we added the ears, right?

617
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,034
Yeah.

618
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,437
Wouldn't it be cool if those ears

619
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,239
can get bigger so she can fly?

620
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,442
That's a great idea!

621
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,094
Ow.

622
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,145
No way.

623
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,754
Ouch.

624
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,623
Not really.

625
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,464
Killing time.

626
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,234
What?

627
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,103
This is what killing time is, right?

628
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,074
When I didn't want to go home,

629
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,077
when I was little,

630
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,980
I was always killing time by myself,
like this.

631
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,618
Me too.

632
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,122
Now, it's the two of us.

633
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,192
Yeah.

634
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,763
The other day, Hikaru…

635
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,765
Sora's college friend.

636
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,667
Hikaru came, and asked you

637
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,203
about Aoi's blood type, right?

638
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,739
-Yeah.
-That time he did.

639
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,908
I exchanged phone numbers with him.

640
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,677
-Then let's call and explain…
-Wait a minute.

641
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,880
You're Type O. Sora's type AB.
Does Sora know this?

642
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:16,781
Yeah.

643
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,185
I knew it since she was three-months-old.

644
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,453
So I tried to prevent her

645
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,823
from doing blood type tests, but…

646
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:28,159
But then, when she was a freshman
in high school,

647
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,594
maybe it was eighth grade,

648
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,430
she went to a blood drive with a friend.

649
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,333
She said, "Mom, I'm Type AB."

650
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,003
How did she find out you're Type O?

651
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,606
-From magazine interview profile pages.
-Oh…

652
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,474
And then?

653
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,577
Oh, right.

654
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,679
But she didn't realize that a Type O mom

655
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,380
-can't have a Type AB child.
-I see.

656
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,684
So I just left it like that!

657
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,252
You just left it, huh?

658
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,888
I knew a day like this would come one day,

659
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,289
but,

660
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,291
I thought maybe

661
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,826
I could play dumb.

662
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,963
Shunichiro.

663
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,298
Do you think I have to

664
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,300
tell her the truth?

665
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,602
-Hm?
-Wait, Aoi.

666
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,104
We're way past that stage.

667
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,308
Hikaru came to our place to ask about

668
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,078
you and Sora's blood types,

669
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,146
and your maternity handbook position
had shifted, right?

670
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,884
Sora already saw what your blood type was.

671
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,987
Please fill in the patient form.

672
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:29,954
Yes.

673
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,358
INCOMING CALL

674
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,628
TEST RESULT DESK

675
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,562
Yes, hello?

676
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,430
Hello, is this Hikaru?

677
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,433
I got your number from Shunichiro.

678
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,303
Yes, I'm with Sora now.

679
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,138
She's a bit far away now.

680
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,908
-Where are you?
<i>-At the hospital.</i>

681
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,577
She's testing her blood type?

682
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,580
<i>Yes, she wants to know her blood type.</i>

683
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,917
Did you tell her?

684
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,952
That Type O moms can't have AB kids.

685
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,855
No, that's not exactly right.

686
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,392
But when we were thinking of characters
for our manga,

687
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,793
we started talking about it.

688
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,896
I realized it was strange at first.

689
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,032
Stop her from taking the test!

690
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,036
How?

691
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,838
You're right. How?

692
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,875
<i>I think she will do the test.</i>

693
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,343
<i>Even if I stopped her.</i>

694
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,314
Ms. Aoi, I'm with her.

695
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,450
I might not be enough,

696
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,920
<i>and I know I'm just a kid.</i>

697
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,189
<i>But I'm with her.</i>

698
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,660
-Oh, she's coming back.
<i>-Hikaru.</i>

699
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,963
Please…

700
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,131
Please look after Sora.

701
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,267
Yes, ma'am.

702
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,771
Who was that? Your girlfriend again?

703
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,440
A new girlfriend?

704
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,607
Something like that.

705
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,778
I heard it's pretty common.

706
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,347
What?

707
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,948
People who mistakenly remember

708
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,950
their own blood type.

709
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,553
I see.

710
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,522
Miss Minase. Miss Sora Minase?

711
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,124
Yes!

712
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,679
I have to go do prep for dinnertime.

713
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,194
What should I do, Gon-chan?

714
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,598
Sora's leaving me. She's going away.

715
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,068
No way that would happen!

716
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,872
I was lying this whole time.

717
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,507
I kept it a secret.

718
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,876
She'll never forgive me!

719
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,279
What are you saying? It'll be okay.

720
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,484
It's over.

721
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,988
Everything's over.

722
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,658
Stop saying that, alright?

723
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,894
Nothing's ending.

724
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,304
I was Type AB.

725
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,007
TYPE AB+

726
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,041
No doubt about it.

727
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,310
I'm Type AB.

728
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,348
Yeah.

729
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,092
Thanks.

730
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,095
-I'll pay you back.
-It's fine.

731
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,267
Do you want to be left alone?

732
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,840
Oh, are you busy?

733
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,208
No.

734
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,043
Not in the slightest.

735
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,613
I made you come with me the whole day.

736
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,783
I just finished
my temporary part-time job so…

737
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,087
Where did you work?

738
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,626
I made banana omelets at a bread factory.

739
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,161
What is that?

740
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,131
You don't know?
They sell it at convenience stores.

741
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,799
They have a whole banana inside.

742
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,601
I roll that up with cream and cake.

743
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,902
That sounds good.

744
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,037
I was peeling the bananas

745
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,672
all day.

746
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,242
-No way!
-It's true! From morning to night!

747
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,544
It takes three or four times to peel
a banana, right?

748
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,079
I can do it in one go!

749
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,113
You're lying!

750
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,616
It's true! There's a trick.

751
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,351
Really?

752
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,262
Hey, don't you have your date
with Doctor Wataru today?

753
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,166
Yeah. It's at six today.

754
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,434
On a day like this?

755
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,638
I promised, so I have to go.

756
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,242
I don't feel like going home,

757
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,810
so it works out.

758
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,513
I see.

759
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,050
What time is it now?

760
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,252
It's…

761
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,222
It's 4:30.

762
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,291
I see.

763
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,227
I have more time.

764
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:39,630
Yeah.

765
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,978
Is that person a stranger?

766
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,415
What?

767
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,518
Because if we're not related by blood,

768
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,520
we're strangers, right?

769
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,190
Don't say it like that.

770
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,527
Your mom would be sad.

771
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,033
I don't know what went on with her, but…

772
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,171
Do you have any ideas?

773
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,482
I don't know what went on with her, but,

774
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,586
I'd probably thank her first.

775
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,557
She wasn't related by blood,
but she raised you.

776
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,995
Aoi Minase

777
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,965
loves Sora Minase very much.

778
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,404
That's how I see it.

779
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,778
Minase…

780
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,581
No…

781
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,483
What should I do?

782
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,919
I shouldn't have…

783
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,990
I shouldn't have tested my blood type!

784
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,128
-Minase…
-Why?

785
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,363
Why did it become like this?

786
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,533
-Minase.
-I love Mom a lot.

787
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,771
-What's happening to me?
-Minase!

788
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,907
Minase! Hold it together, alright?

789
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,611
I'm here. It'll be okay.

790
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,346
You're not alone.

791
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,516
I'm not alone?

792
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,718
Yeah. I'll be here. I won't go away.

793
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:45,156
I can't say things like I'll protect you.
I won't.

794
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,325
I can't be that cool,

795
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,260
or be that confident,

796
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,262
but I'll be here.

797
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,798
No matter what happens.

798
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,400
Don't forget I'm here,

799
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,302
okay?

800
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,772
Irino!

801
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,042
Irino.

802
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,446
<i>This was my first time being hugged</i>

803
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,613
<i>by a boy.</i>

804
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,884
<i>It was like a weak grandma</i>

805
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,986
<i>leaning against an utility pole.</i>

806
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,791
<i>Far from romantic, but sincere.</i>

807
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,462
<i>Stay, Irino.</i>

808
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,598
Honey!

809
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,301
Chili pepper.

810
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,237
Yuzu citrus.

811
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,109
Alright!

812
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,512
What!

813
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,382
Is this Iberian pork bacon?

814
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,084
You have such nice ingredients,
rich woman!

815
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,820
Call me anytime you want.

816
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,125
I'll answer within three rings.

817
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,265
Yes, hello?

818
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,368
You're right. That was one ring.

819
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,875
Don't get cocky just because you're cute!

820
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,610
Huh?

821
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,578
No, I'll work hard

822
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,947
so I can answer in half a ring

823
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,049
next time round!

824
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,090
Order up! Gon-chan's special soup.

825
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,691
I don't want it.

826
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,161
Don't say that! I made it for you.

827
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,250
-So good!
-Right? The secret ingredient is miso.

828
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,420
It's better to eat something.
You'll feel calmer.

829
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:57,755
Yeah.

830
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,724
Sora went on her date
with Doctor Wataru, right?

831
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,195
Yeah. I got a call from Hikaru just now.

832
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,263
Hikaru's a handsome boy,
and Doctor Wataru's

833
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,432
a good doctor. Sora's so popular!

834
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,802
A man on each arm.
Maybe she doesn't need you!

835
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,341
Hey, it was just a joke.

836
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,578
It just means Sora's grown up.
She'll understand.

837
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,913
-You think so?
-Yeah.

838
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,283
What will happen to us?

839
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,787
Listen, Aoi.

840
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,523
No matter what,

841
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,626
I'll protect the both of you.

842
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,095
I proposed to you and Sora here. Remember?

843
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,331
What?

844
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,099
Proposed? What do you mean?

845
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,069
Hey, you.

846
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:46,937
Hey.

847
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,941
If you need help,

848
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,745
I can raise her with you.

849
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,883
Hey, it's alright!

850
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,520
Nako helps me out too, so I'll be fine.

851
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,623
What? That was a marriage proposal?

852
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,691
I didn't get that at all!

853
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,895
I thought you were just offering to
come help me again tomorrow.

854
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,930
Back then, Sora cried so much at night.

855
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,533
She wouldn't let me sleep.
I was tired and hazy.

856
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,302
You have to explain to me,
"This is a marriage proposal!"

857
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,638
Like I'd ever say, "Please marry me!"

858
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,107
But you left the country
for years after that!

859
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,642
To heal my broken heart.

860
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,511
As if! You married Étoile immediately!

861
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,679
That's irrelevant.

862
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,248
-I decline your offer.
-What?

863
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,984
I respectfully decline your proposal.

864
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,855
I'm not proposing right now!
Just back then!

865
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,924
I'd never propose to you ever again!

866
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,126
I just felt bad for you back then.

867
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,562
It was out of pity, okay?

868
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,564
FRENCH BULLDOG

869
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,665
Oh.

870
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:52,036
I just noticed that you looked down today.

871
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,904
I do?

872
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,507
Did something happen?

873
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,178
That's good.

874
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,280
Oh.

875
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,584
I might have a slight fever.

876
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,952
What? In that case…

877
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,154
No. I don't need a treatment today.

878
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,390
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:15,459
I'm going home.

880
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,572
Yes!

881
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,907
SORA MINASE

882
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,108
Yeah.

883
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,977
Yeah, what's up?

884
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,745
<i>I don't want to go home.</i>

885
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,014
Oh, makes sense.

886
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,882
<i>Can I come over?</i>

887
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,552
What? Now?

888
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,855
Wait, my room right now…

889
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,491
Is really messy…

890
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,726
Where are you right now?

891
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,530
-You find it okay?
-Yeah.

892
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,233
-On Google Maps.
-Right. Come in.

893
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:57,835
Thank you.

894
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,478
-Hey, Miss Minase?
-Yeah?

895
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,047
Don't do these things to random men.

896
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,750
Certain men of a certain age might
want to do you.

897
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,718
You're doing me?

898
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,788
No! Not me, never!

899
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,157
I'm not so desperate for girls
that I'd need you!

900
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,058
But, you know,

901
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,595
if you do this to random men,
you don't know what they'll think!

902
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:25,996
I choose my men.

903
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,732
I was chosen! No, that's irrelevant.

904
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,001
I changed the sheets here.

905
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,070
I have water and food in the fridge.

906
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,238
Help yourself.

907
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,539
What about you?

908
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,743
Well, you know,

909
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,646
I'm of a certain age too.

910
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,348
I'll spend the night at a manga café.

911
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,419
It'll be fine! I'll answer your call
in three rings.

912
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,586
I did just now, right?

913
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,021
I jumped out of the shower.

914
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:51,922
Oh, right.

915
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,991
I'm going here.

916
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,726
Manga Café "Sea Turtle."

917
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,595
It's really close. I can come by
if anything happens.

918
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,931
Did you contact your mom?

919
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,133
Yeah.

920
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,436
I told her
I'm going out all night with a friend.

921
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:07,771
Okay.

922
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,524
SORA: I'LL BE OUT ALL NIGHT.
KEEP THE CHAIN UNLOCKED FOR ME.

923
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:28,425
AOI: GOT IT!

924
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,005
Sora's favorite drink.

925
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,108
The Limoncello.

926
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,344
ROOM 53 WITH RECLINING SEAT

927
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,180
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

928
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,281
You have a guest.

929
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,616
What?

930
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,555
Why are you here?

931
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,457
100 YEN

932
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,458
No!

933
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,063
I didn't want to be alone.

934
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,200
So I followed you here.

935
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,904
You're too unguarded all of a sudden.

936
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,139
Because you drew Jadwiga.

937
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,407
What?

938
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,110
Materializing what's in someone's heart

939
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,480
and turning it into a drawing is

940
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,618
the same thing as opening our hearts
to each other, right?

941
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,522
When did you think that?

942
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,525
I just made it up now.

943
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,927
Stop that.

944
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,096
Don't play with my emotions like that!

945
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,099
It's so strange.

946
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,639
When I'm with you, my heart is free.

947
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,875
I really want to cry.

948
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,944
And I don't know what to do.

949
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,848
But with you, I can find an escape route

950
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,617
for my heart.

951
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,119
I'm an escape route then?

952
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,221
But beyond that escape route,

953
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:05,689
I can see light.

954
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,491
Because my name's Hikaru?

955
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,328
Mom mentioned that.

956
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,831
"You both have pretty names

957
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,465
meaning light and sky,

958
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,569
so why don't you call each other
by first names?"

959
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,440
Whenever I call you Minase,

960
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,809
I see the sky.

961
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,912
I feel like a blue sky is

962
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,814
opening up in front of me.

963
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,484
Was that a joke?

964
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:35,652
No, I'm serious.

965
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,123
I'm tired.

966
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,793
Today was a tiring day.

967
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,629
I'm going to sleep.

968
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:53,937
Hey…

969
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,507
What do you mean, sleep?

970
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,347
She's really asleep.

971
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,236
Mom.

972
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,972
Thank you. I'm fine here.

973
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:04,775
Are you fine by yourself?

974
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:06,743
Yeah.

975
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,047
It's still three rings, right?

976
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,584
Of course. Buy me dinner next time, okay?

977
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,053
Yeah.

978
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,956
<i>Yakisoba</i> at Odaya? <i>Taiyaki?</i>

979
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,459
Oh.

980
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,828
-Huh?
-There's a gachapon.

981
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:26,997
CELLS AT WORK
THAT TIME I GOT REINCARNATED AS A SLIME

982
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,865
Do they have White Blood Cell?

983
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,867
Jadwiga will go in here one day!

984
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,436
Good idea.

985
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,075
The shiny glass ball.

986
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:39,977
You're right.

987
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,279
Your favorite.

988
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,648
My favorite.

989
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,718
If I get it, it's yours.

990
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,119
What?

991
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,622
This makes the city look upside down,
so it's interesting, right?

992
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,460
If you want to cry, look at the world
through this.

993
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,862
Will you get it, though?

994
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,564
Of course I will!

995
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,602
What?

996
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,341
Wow!

997
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,019
<i>This will be my lucky charm.</i>

998
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,954
<i>Yeah!</i>

999
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,401
I'm home.

1000
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,472
I just woke up. I'm making coffee.

1001
