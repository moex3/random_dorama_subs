1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,809
-Mom.
-Yeah?

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,514
Am I not your daughter?

3
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,518
Because,

4
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,422
look at this. I'm Blood type AB.

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,457
Mom, you're Type O, right?

6
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,030
Type O moms can't have Type AB children.

7
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,334
Mom,

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,337
who are you?

9
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,722
Back then, I was only 23 or 24.

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,059
I had someone I loved a lot.

11
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,232
I thought I was born in this world
to meet him.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,135
He was my whole world.

13
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,539
But…

14
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,175
He betrayed me.

15
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,748
Back then, Mom… Oh.

16
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,684
I was

17
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,887
depending on him a lot.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,225
When I thought I lost him,

19
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,128
I felt like I had lost the ground
I was standing on.

20
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,667
-You weren't a writer yet?
-What?

21
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,936
If you were a writer,

22
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,604
maybe writing would have

23
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,807
saved Aoi Minase.

24
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,643
It was the opposite.

25
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,315
<i>The Scent of the Sky</i> became
a huge hit quickly,

26
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,117
and the world put me on a pedestal.

27
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,086
They expected a lot from me,

28
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,889
and that put pressure on me
and I couldn't write my next book.

29
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,192
Living was only pain.

30
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,195
I had nowhere to go.

31
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,500
I felt like I had no reason to
keep living.

32
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,337
I didn't feel like I had a purpose.

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,242
I think I was depressed.

34
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,911
So…

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,215
I went to the forest in Ashigaoka.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,086
Now that I think about it,
it was the first time

37
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,923
in my long life where
I thought of that sort of thing. So, Mom…

38
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,060
I…

39
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,469
I tried to die.

40
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,041
Going into the forest
through the entrance,

41
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,514
the leaves were so pretty.

42
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,852
I wasn't scared of anything.

43
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,188
If I just kept on.

44
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,492
-Kept walking on and on…
-Mom!

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,528
I thought I could die.

46
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,733
I kept going deeper into the forest.

47
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,538
But then, I heard a voice.

48
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,343
The voice of a baby crying.

49
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,155
It was you.

50
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,924
You were crying.

51
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,560
You were…

52
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,230
Alive.

53
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,700
You were placed in a tiny basket.

54
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,606
You had these tiny hands and a tiny face.

55
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,609
And you were crying,
with your face all red.

56
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,045
I found myself

57
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,951
reaching out to you without realizing it.

58
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,695
I picked you up in my arms.

59
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,803
And you were so warm.

60
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,142
So, so warm.

61
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,914
I couldn't stop crying

62
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,119
at the fact that you were so warm.

63
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,855
My tears kept falling.

64
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,092
It woke me up.

65
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,331
I decided to keep living,

66
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,737
and to raise this child.

67
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,645
That's a wild story.

68
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,214
Yeah, totally wild.

69
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,550
But that means, the abandoned baby and…

70
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,787
Oh, sorry.

71
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,623
No. It's the truth.

72
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,958
And Aoi Minase who was trying to die,

73
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,127
both their lives were saved, right?

74
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,530
I guess so.

75
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,267
I didn't know fateful meetings like that
existed in real life.

76
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,937
Isn't that more impressive
than giving birth?

77
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,173
Yeah.

78
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,811
Then, when Mom picked me up,

79
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,246
she looked up for the first time that day

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,982
and realized it was sunny.

81
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,618
And she cried at how blue the sky was.

82
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,056
That's why she named me Sora,
after the sky.

83
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,827
That's so moving. It makes me cry!

84
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,261
Don't cry!

85
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,867
After I heard that, I didn't care about
blood types anymore,

86
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,472
or about blood relations.

87
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,541
Yeah.

88
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,213
Honestly, if me being abandoned saved Mom

89
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,750
who was trying to die,

90
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,687
I feel glad that I was abandoned
in the forest.

91
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,856
That's what I thought.

92
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,428
You're your Mom's life, Sora.

93
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:37,964
What?

94
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,033
Because you were here,
your Mom decided to live,

95
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,935
and kept on living.

96
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,843
But you know, I don't really know
what to do right now.

97
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,613
Sora! You want some Milba?

98
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,448
Hazelnut and Clione!

99
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,751
You can't eat Clione. It's Praline.

100
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,787
Oh, right! You're right.

101
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,957
<i>It feels awkward just to laugh.</i>

102
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,560
Yeah, but you know,

103
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,562
it's the same with all parents.

104
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,265
When you live with them versus

105
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,234
after you move out,

106
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,604
or even after you get married,

107
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,642
your relationship
with your family changes.

108
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,017
That's true.
Nothing stays the same forever.

109
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,986
Even families.

110
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,990
It doesn't have to be the same forever.

111
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,161
As long as you want to be
in each other's lives,

112
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,797
even if it's imperfect.

113
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,571
You look upside down.

114
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,073
An upside-down Hikaru.

115
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,976
Why my first name?

116
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,646
You call me Sora sometimes too.
It's okay, right?

117
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,421
You don't have a single page of
<i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams</i> written?

118
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,391
Yes. Not one line, not one word.

119
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,726
Well…

120
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,430
-We have five pages for serialization.
-Yes.

121
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,334
The book will be released
around May next year…

122
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,206
Did something happen?

123
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,612
Yes. Something happened.

124
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,815
I may not be able to write for a while.

125
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,684
You say a while,
but you haven't written forever…

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,422
My daughter's not my real kid.

127
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,461
-What?
-I'm not her real mother.

128
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,197
And she found out.

129
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,900
Is it okay that
you're sharing this with me?

130
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,670
<i>Konishi knows too. And Ms. Matsuyama.</i>

131
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,039
She helped me change Sora's diapers
from the start.

132
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,908
They're so open-minded.

133
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,045
I can trust Konishi in that regard.

134
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,582
Konishi doesn't say unnecessary things.
He only does what benefits him.

135
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,986
I don't mean to be intrusive, but,

136
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,722
how did you come to care for Sora?

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,792
I found her in the forest.

138
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,633
What? So your mom isn't your mom?

139
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,834
Yeah.

140
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,706
So cold!

141
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,644
I got confused and tried to make
you laugh.

142
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,317
But is it okay that you're
sharing this with me?

143
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,552
We became friends the other day.

144
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,592
I have toxic parents,
so that wouldn't bother me,

145
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,427
but you must be in shock.

146
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:55,995
Yes.

147
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,563
A little.

148
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,766
Also, apparently,

149
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,503
I was abandoned in the forest.

150
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,544
-I don't think you were abandoned.
-What?

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,280
I can totally imagine it in my mind.

152
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,654
When your mom went to the forest,

153
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,823
she found a beam of light.

154
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,659
And she found the cutest baby ever!

155
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,829
-Like Princess Kaguya.
-What?

156
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,300
You're just like Princess Kaguya, Sora!

157
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,204
You're cute, you have black hair,
and you're very Japanese.

158
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,307
-Very Japanese?
-You look like you'd return to the moon.

159
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,342
Sora.

160
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,145
You weren't abandoned.

161
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,883
You're an angel who fell from the sky.

162
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,687
And your mom was a very lucky girl
for finding you!

163
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,361
Sally.

164
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,535
What's up, Sora?

165
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,573
You know… I…

166
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,611
I only felt gratitude

167
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,180
for Mom for taking me in,

168
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,984
but it bothered me

169
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,087
that I was abandoned as a baby.

170
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,891
-Sora.
-So…

171
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,960
When you say it like that,

172
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,165
it makes me feel much, much, better!

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,470
Don't go back to the moon,
Princess Kaguya.

174
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,507
Please stay here forever.

<i>UMBILICAL CORD</i> - SEASON ONE

176
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,912
CHIROPRACTOR: TAIYOU-DO

177
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,382
Have you been diving lately? Skydiving?

178
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,385
-It's scuba diving.
-Probably not. It's winter.

179
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,521
Scuba diving in winter is pretty nice too.

180
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,523
You must be busy with your dates?

181
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,660
-Oh, not at all.
-Not at all?

182
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,462
She doesn't call me at all.

183
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,431
We went on a date recently, but…

184
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,600
Is something wrong?

185
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,835
<i>She's a little cold.</i>

186
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,037
A little aloof, like she's distracted.

187
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,306
I wonder if something happened.

188
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,410
But when I ask her about it on the phone,
she says, "It's nothing."

189
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,846
But I'm sure something happened,
so I ask her if

190
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,749
something happened at home,
and she says, "It's nothing."

191
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,419
-Maybe something at school…
-Doctor, that's too annoying.

192
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,555
Only ask "Did something happen?" once.

193
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,925
If she doesn't answer,
you have to let it go.

194
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,601
<i>No matter how hard it is,</i>
<i>stories always save me.</i>

195
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,403
<i>I'm Mom's kid after all.</i>

196
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,206
<i>Even if we're not related by blood,</i>

197
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,176
<i>we're connected, somehow.</i>

198
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:18,090
Milba…

199
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,626
She's calling for ice cream?

200
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,330
Is she a child?

201
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,768

Sora and Aoi.

UMBILICAL CORD

207
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,363
I think that is an umbilical cord.

208
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,432
I found it at home.

209
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,368
Maybe it's your mom's.

210
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,506
This is just my intuition,
but I think it's mine.

211
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,443
If I was abandoned in the forest,
why does she have my umbilical cord?

212
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,016
Hey, have you read this?

213
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,152
Mom's novel that got canceled.

214
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,088
I only read manga.

215
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,590
I've never read Mom's novels.

216
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,392
There is a

217
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,195
really similar scene in this book.
Right here.

218
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,435
"Nagisa held Ito in her arms
and cried in the forest.

219
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,904
She looks up at the sky
and sees how blue it is.

220
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,374
I'll raise her. If I don't raise
her now, she will die.

221
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,244
That's how I found my reason to live.
My reason to live, to raise this child."

222
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,247
You should put
a little more emotion in that.

223
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,248
It's the climax scene!

224
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,751
-It's a carbon copy.
-Right?

225
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,653
-Weird, right?
-No.

226
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,690
She will do anything
when she's desperate for ideas.

227
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,693
She doesn't care about selling
her own life.

228
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,997
She'd rather turn that into money
to eat <i>yakiniku</i> at Hamada.

229
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,532
But that story,

230
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,670
it sounds too perfect.
It felt too beautiful to me.

231
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,672
It's like a novel.

232
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,043
-If there's one thing…
-What?

233
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,781
If there's one thing that bothers me
about this whole thing…

234
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,583
What is it?

235
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,786
Mom. That woman,

236
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,857
Aoi Minase. I'm so sure that
she wouldn't do it.

237
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,659
-Try to die of her own accord.
-What?

238
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,996
Just like a cockroach,
she'll live until she's killed.

239
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,665
<i>She's like a ball of life.</i>

240
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,606
This is awful.

241
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,142
<i>MIDSUMMER SKIES ARE DREAMS</i>

242
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,150
Aoi went to die in the forest,

243
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,519
and found the abandoned Sora
and took her in.

244
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,423
That's the very general explanation.

245
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,526
I have to go prep for dinner.

246
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,461
Kenta's working.

247
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,765
You can't run away.

248
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,168
Why did Aoi say such a thing…?

249
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,473
So it's a lie! Mom told a lie!

250
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,909
That bitch! I won't forgive her!

251
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,945
Telling a lie in that moment?

252
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,146
Stay calm, Sora.

253
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,683
After I couldn't sleep the whole night
because of our blood types…

254
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,419
You were asleep! I couldn't sleep!

255
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,856
-When did that happen?
-No, it's not like that.

256
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,925
-Nothing happened at all!
-Not a thing.

257
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,894
I couldn't sleep

258
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,496
and I felt pain!

259
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,366
I tried to desperately

260
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,303
accept the truth

261
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,372
in my own way.

262
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,776
Am I not your daughter?

263
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,179
What the hell is this?

264
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,718
I took the time to believe
in her forest story!

265
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,221
I believed in her story and accepted it

266
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,791
and came to terms with it in my own way

267
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,560
and felt immense gratitude for her!

268
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,829
I thought that now,

269
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,398
I could keep being with Mom

270
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,735
and stay by her side…

271
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,712
Sora. It's because of
this crummy old thing!

272
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,617
What! He ate it!

273
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,853
What are you doing, Dad!

274
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,490
Spit it out! What about Suzu?

275
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,225
You wanna make Suzu cry?

276
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,127
"Suzu"?

277
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,032
It's a magic trick.
It looks like I swallowed it, right?

278
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,301
You really surprised us!

279
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,769
-Here.
-Okay!

280
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,039
-We're leaving, Kenta.
-Yes, sir.

281
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,407
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

282
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,042
-Safe travels!
-Thanks.

283
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,312
-I can come too?
-If you can.

284
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:45,083
Sora, I'm sorry about this.

285
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,020
You should've swallowed it.

286
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,924
If you say that,
Shunichiro will really eat it!

287
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,394
He really cares about you, Sora.

288
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,266
I'm sorry for causing this much concern.

289
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,001
It's really nothing.

290
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,072
Sally.

291
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,643
I'll go to your place with Shunichiro.

292
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,345
What? It sounds like

293
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,181
everyone just wants to find out
what happens next, right?

294
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,888
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T WRITE.
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T WRITE.

295
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,490
Sorry. I can't write at all.

296
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,395
I took the plot summary you gave me

297
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,197
and divided it into four sequences.

298
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,233
So that it's easier for you to write.

299
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,103
-This is really helpful.
-How is it?

300
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,111
But these things hold back
free associations!

301
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,313
My unpredictable imagination would die!

302
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,153
Sorry. I'm kidding.

303
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,925
I just wanted to talk like an artist,
just this once.

304
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,262
I'll look through this.

305
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,892
Hello.

306
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,061
-Come in, come on in.
-Okay.

307
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,429
-Thank you.
-Please take a seat.

308
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,498
Shunichiro and Sally, sit here.

309
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,400
What about Gon-chan?

310
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,402
Gon-chan, sit here. And Hikaru…

311
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,675
Are you Soseki?

312
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,513
-How could you tell?
-It's obvious! There's hair in his eyes.

313
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,882
He's tall and sharp,
and his legs are thin!

314
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,218
I'm really sorry about what happened.

315
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,056
-It's not something to apologize about…
-Wait a second, you guys!

316
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,893
Today's not the day for this!
We're not all here today

317
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,528
during Odaya's peak hours,

318
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,164
leaving Kenta to do everything to do this!

319
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,800
Wow, you've become quite the leader.

320
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,737
Huh? What the heck is up
with that attitude?

321
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,572
I'll make some tea.

322
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,042
Right, tea! Since everyone's here.

323
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,812
-I brought <i>taiyaki</i> and <i>sanmayaki</i> too.
-Good idea.

324
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,280
I'll help serve.

325
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,581
Don't run away!

326
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,686
I'm not here to have

327
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,556
pleasant afternoon tea.

328
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,858
I brought everyone here

329
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,428
because Mom lies when it's just us two.

330
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,766
I brought the Odaya members
because they know my past.

331
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,304
Mom.

332
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,638
UMBILICAL CORD

333
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,840
This is an umbilical cord.

334
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,043
Just like your novel.

335
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,714
Why did you lie to me and say
you found me in the forest?

336
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,550
Tell me the truth.

337
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,089
I prepare it like so

338
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,059
and sell these.

339
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,727
I see.

340
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,800
-Do you dive in the winter often?
-Yes.

341
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,269
The sea bream are beautiful.

342
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,873
Also, I want to feel refreshed.

343
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,475
-Refreshed?
-Yes.

344
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,311
I'm about to get dumped.

345
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,715
It's nice to be young.

346
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,850
But I'm getting dumped.

347
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,553
Excuse me.

348
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,929
I take a photo of the sky.

349
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:55,367
-Before the sun sets.
-I see.

350
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,172
-The sky is beautiful and calm today.
-Yes.

351
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,775
The sky changes every day.

352
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,379
It's never the same.

353
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,247
It's just like

354
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,317
our hearts.

355
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,155
I fell in love.

356
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,293
It wasn't like the love I'd experienced
in the past.

357
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,164
It was like I got struck by lightning.
An overwhelming love.

358
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,302
I think I'll get us some tea, actually.

359
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,404
Oh, me too! And how about you, Watt?

360
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,774
I want to hear this.
Aoi Minase's one true love.

361
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,844
Yes, yes. Love like you got struck
by lightning!

362
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,214
For a week after meeting him,

363
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,749
we never left each other's side.

364
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,018
Sorry, I have final proofs due today
so I'll be leaving.

365
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,222
Why don't you want to hear
Aoi's love story?

366
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,957
Why?

367
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,025
-Is something going on?
-Excuse me, everyone.

368
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,228
I'm sure you have many feelings
going on right now,

369
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,762
but for now, for today,

370
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,665
will you prioritize my feelings first?

371
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,502
I want to hear from Mom.

372
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,339
The woman who raised me.

373
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,508
I want to hear how I met her,

374
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:13,411
and how I came to be
mother and daughter with her.

375
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,052
I…

376
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,289
I loved him a lot.

377
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,360
I think I still love him.

378
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,465
No matter how many times
I fell in love after that,

379
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,434
no one would be better than him.

380
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,503
There's a part of me that believes that.

381
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,474
I can't forget him.

382
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,446
-A person you can't forget?
-Yes.

383
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,748
Originally,

384
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,884
I couldn't forget about a classmate

385
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,419
from third grade.

386
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,323
So strange, right?

387
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,027
No, I get it.

388
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,131
I have someone I can't forget either.

389
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,735
Someone who grows more vibrant

390
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,872
in my memories as more time passes.

391
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,509
<i>-His name is Fuga Ichinose.</i>
-A stage name?

392
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,344
These are his photos.

393
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,548
No way! He's so handsome!

394
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,849
It's a bromide.

395
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,051
A bromide?

396
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,986
This wasn't 100 years ago, Shunichiro.

397
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,556
No, they still say that.
They sell three photos for 600 yen.

398
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,759
-I paid 1,000 yen. Was I ripped off?
-Is this from Ofuse?

399
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,964
It was a theater near
Shimokitazawa Station.

400
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,834
I attended his performance many times.

401
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,238
Life is but a walking shadow!

402
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,377
Tears are the smallest seas

403
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,746
humans could make!

404
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,517
Only three in the audience today?

405
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,790
-Let's quit this show.
-No, don't stop!

406
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,159
I'm watching.

407
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,497
<i>That was how we met.</i>

408
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,734
Does that count as meeting him?
That's like an idol otaku

409
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,636
saying, "He looked at me!"

410
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,005
No. We met that day.

411
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,677
Then, we fell in love.

412
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,381
And after a week he went.

413
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,784
-He disappeared.
-What?

414
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,654
He probably used you.

415
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,890
I went to his theater troupe

416
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,825
<i>and figured out where he lived.</i>

417
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,133
What?

418
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:53,038
I'm sorry. Ichinose's not here right now.

419
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,974
He left six months ago.

420
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:57,909
I'm sorry.

421
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,847
Wait a minute. You look pale!

422
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,654
Are you pregnant?

423
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,624
Do you have a baby?

424
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,161
That's Suzu?

425
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,496
Yes.

426
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,299
She's your mother.

427
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,037
<i>-She was born with a weak heart.</i>
-Suzu?

428
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:31,109
<i>She was trying to have the baby</i>
<i>against doctors' orders.</i>

429
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,981
She really wanted to have you.

430
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,785
What the hell are you thinking?

431
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,755
It's the ex-girlfriend
of the guy you like, right?

432
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,423
Why are you taking care of her?

433
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,295
She has no family. Well, she does,
but she can't depend on them.

434
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,466
How does that lead to you
visiting her in the hospital?

435
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,471
I can't leave someone alone
if they need help.

436
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,208
ODAYA

437
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,543
Wow, it's good.

438
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,980
Don't eat too fast.

439
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,953
If Ichinose left

440
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,722
six months ago,
does that mean he doesn't know

441
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,125
you're pregnant?

442
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,361
He doesn't.

443
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,800
This is a bit awkward for me to say,

444
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,804
but a lot of women other than you

445
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,873
visited that apartment.

446
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,712
I was an actress, you know?

447
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,414
In the same theater troupe as Ichinose.

448
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,455
You're really beautiful.
That's what I guessed.

449
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,060
But I couldn't fight that hard
for my career.

450
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,899
I wasn't that type of girl.

451
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,334
I'm not ambitious.

452
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,341
I just wanted to be with the man I love.

453
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,478
That's all.

454
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,748
That's all there is to me.

455
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,652
I think it's straightforward
and admirable.

456
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,122
I want to meet Ichinose's child.

457
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,126
He's a butthead,

458
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,664
but I love him, so I want to have
this kid no matter what.

459
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,972
But I wasn't thinking about
this child at all.

460
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,710
I…

461
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,913
I might die.

462
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,150
If that happens,

463
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,220
what'll happen to this child?

464
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,427
-It's okay! Leave it to me!
-What?

465
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,629
If something happens to you, Suzu,

466
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,032
then I'll raise your child!

467
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,034
So have this child!

468
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,440
Are you serious, Aoi?

469
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:19,978
I'm serious.

470
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,482
Why… Why would you do this much for me?

471
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,888
We suffered at the hands of
the same butthead.

472
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,191
We're on the same team.

473
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,494
You remember how

474
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,830
you let me touch your belly?

475
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,901
Touch it.

476
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,644
I can feel her move.

477
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,013
She's alive.

478
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,519
This kid will be born to be happy.

479
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,825
This kid will be born in this world
to be happy!

480
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,831
I will help to make that happen.

481
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,268
On a beautiful sunny day,

482
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,806
Suzu gave birth to Sora,

483
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,109
and after a while,

484
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,078
she passed away.

485
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,250
-She's a selfish woman!
-What?

486
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,018
She loved without a plan.

487
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,088
She gave birth without a plan.

488
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,992
And she pushed her kid onto you,
a total stranger! What the hell?

489
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,861
She's insane! Just a stupid woman
who went crazy from love!

490
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,265
Sora! Don't say those things!

491
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,367
Because it's so irresponsible!

492
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,937
I would've preferred to have been
abandoned in the forest!

493
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,076
She risked her life to have you!
Don't you say that!

494
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,844
Apologize to Suzu!

495
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,514
Is this world

496
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,618
so harsh on you? Are you in pain?

497
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,155
Is this world not worth living for?

498
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,325
Don't you know how much
Suzu suffered to have you?

499
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,160
I didn't ask for that!

500
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,864
Why does this have to be the reason

501
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,800
you hit me for the first time?

502
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,837
Why did you hit me?

503
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,675
-Why!
-Sora. It's okay.

504
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,610
-Why!
-I'm right here.

505
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,245
Sora, calm down, okay?

506
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,913
-Do you want water?
-It's gonna be alright.

507
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,549
I'm taking Sora to Odaya.

508
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,729
Why did you lie about finding her
in the forest?

509
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,500
Because you knew this would happen?

510
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,271
I didn't want to tell her the truth.

511
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,140
Because,

512
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,942
Suzu passed away,

513
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,648
but Sora's father is probably still alive.

514
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:17,288
She's related to that man by blood.

515
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,759
She might leave me for her father.

516
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,532
He might take Sora away.

517
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,203
Are bloodlines that important?

518
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,440
I'll never know.

519
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,813
I never had a child.

520
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,589
Should I call for Gon?

521
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,292
Huh? What? Why?

522
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,061
Because he knows you the best

523
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,666
and he's the person you want to be with
the most right now.

524
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:08,673
Soseki.

525
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,508
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,814
What are you apologizing for, exactly?

527
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,220
Is it because I'm not the one
you want and need now?

528
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,788
Is that it?

529
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,359
I'm sorry. I don't want to fight you.

530
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,731
ODAYA

531
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,333
Sora.

532
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,169
Shunichiro and Gon-chan made us
sweet bean soup.

533
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,273
Thank you for the meal.

534
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,247
It's so good!

535
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,759
It's good.

536
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,365
What's wrong?

537
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,669
I'm afraid Sora will break.

538
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,739
She won't break. She's not that weak.

539
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,841
I shouldn't be crying.

540
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,310
I'm an adult. So pathetic.

541
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,712
It's fine.

542
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,449
You're still 20, right? Life is long.

543
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,920
Pretend you're a kid and cry. But…

544
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,856
Don't cry in front of Sora.

545
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,259
Of course. I'm prepared to do that.

546
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,095
Alright. Then cry now.

547
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,866
It's a promise between men.
I'll keep it a secret.

548
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,303
-Want a drink?
-Yes, sir.

549
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,143
I think Suzu,

550
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,080
your birth mother,

551
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,318
loved you very much Sora,

552
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,287
when you were in her belly.

553
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,524
You know how I told you

554
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,295
I came to Tokyo from Tsugaru
to chase after a man?

555
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,035
I was pregnant back then.

556
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,205
What?

557
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,308
It's embarrassing,
so I'm going to use my Tsugaru accent.

558
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,243
Can you understand?

559
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,878
Yeah.

560
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,847
And the father

561
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,084
of that kid

562
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,820
didn't want to take any responsibility.

563
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,789
I couldn't have it alone.

564
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,759
I thought my life would end.

565
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,295
So I got an abortion.

566
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,800
I really respect Suzu

567
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,471
for having you, Sora.

568
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,209
She was brave. She had love.

569
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,214
You came into this world
through so much love.

570
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,418
You were raised in this world
with so much love.

571
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,355
What are you unhappy about?

572
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,331
I… I…

573
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,435
I love Mom.

574
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,005
I love the mother I have now.

575
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:31,909
So I…

576
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,645
I…

577
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:44,522
I wanted to be Mom's daughter!

578
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,262
What are you doing?

579
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,467
I got what I wanted.

580
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,936
I have proof right here.

581
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,005
Your confession of love!

582
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,508
Hey, you…

583
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,589
SORA'S CRY OF LOVE!

584
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,895
<i>I… I…</i>

585
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>I wanted to be Mom's daughter!</i>

586
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,355
Suzu. You did so well!

587
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,890
She's so energetic!

588
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,761
She's a girl. So cute!

589
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,963
Thank you.

590
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,933
I have to think of a name.

591
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,236
A name, huh?

592
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,307
Oh, it's morning.

593
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,077
-I'll open the curtain.
-Okay.

594
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,254
-Sora.
-Sora… What?

595
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,058
"Sora" is a good name, right?

596
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,295
I thought so too.

597
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,373
<i>And the blue sky continues to this day</i>

598
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,341
<i>and I'm alive.</i>

599
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:45,910
RISSEI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

600
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,011
<i>Even after all this,</i>

601
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,513
<i>there's 24 hours in a day,</i>

602
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,316
<i>and the third period of Friday</i>
<i>is the Keynes Seminar.</i>

603
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,019
<i>And the days just go on.</i>

604
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,855
<i>The world is strong.</i>

605
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,458
<i>It doesn't care about me.</i>

606
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,761
-Awesome, yeah!
-Sounds cool, doesn't it?

607
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,029
-A music festival?
-Yeah!

608
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,497
Let's turn up!

609
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,799
-Definitely!
-Perfect.

610
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,837
Who do you want?

611
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,174
I just saw you scan the room for someone.

612
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:19,844
A crow.

613
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,381
I was looking to see if there was a crow.

614
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,451
It's Hikaru, right?

615
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,655
You've been hogging Hikaru lately.
What do you want?

616
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,024
I'm not hogging him.

617
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,260
He's not anyone's thing. He's a free man.

618
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,596
You're just a gloomy otaku!

619
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,265
You think you're better than that?

620
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,536
-Stop it! So annoying!
-Annoying? What the hell?

621
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,305
Your perfume freaking stinks!

622
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,674
-Cut it out!
-Stop it!

623
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,676
-You piss me off!
-Let me go.

624
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,778
You're so annoying!

625
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,248
-You bitch!
-Hey, stop it! What's going on?

626
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,049
You too, Minase!

627
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,951
-Hey!
-You're annoying!

628
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,521
-What's going on?
-Hikaru, help!

629
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,222
<i>For the first time ever,</i>

630
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,024
<i>I got in a fight with a party girl.</i>

631
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,158
-Why'd this happen?
-No idea!

632
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,162
-Ouch!
-Oh, sorry.

633
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,933
You don't need to be with Airi?

634
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,801
-No.
-Oh.

635
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,504
Isn't she your current girlfriend?

636
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,075
I want a hotter girl, like a model.

637
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,844
A girl with really high hips.

638
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,316
You like girls with nice figures.

639
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,486
What's her name?

640
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,255
It's Kokoro.

641
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:41,859
That's a nice name.

642
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,030
Sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

643
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,366
Aoi, it's not sweet bean soup today.

644
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,735
We made <i>zenzai.</i> Your favorite, right?

645
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,872
We got some really nice red beans
from Tokachi by chance!

646
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:58,342
I'm sorry. I'm only having tea today.

647
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,445
What? You don't have an appetite?

648
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,381
-I'm sorry.
-The ogre has weakened.

649
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,650
You must be worried about Sora.

650
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,687
-How is she doing?
-Well.

651
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,922
<i>It's been okay.</i>

652
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,293
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

653
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,130
I see.

654
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,800
I guess time will solve everything.

655
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,103
What?

656
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,471
SAKURAHAMA PARK

657
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,873
You've never rented it?

658
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,744
Don't be spoiled!
I'm trying to ride the bike with you.

659
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,750
Sorry, that came off strong.
You weren't being spoiled.

660
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,219
I'm the one that said I'd join you…

661
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,789
It's unlocked.

662
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,830
<i>When you move your body,</i>

663
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,166
<i>all your heavy parts fly away bit by bit</i>

664
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,636
<i>with the wind.</i>

665
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,140
<i>The scenery keeps changing</i>

666
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,976
<i>and the truth falls and settles inside,</i>

667
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,745
<i>into my stomach.</i>

668
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,848
<i>You don't need to rush.</i>

669
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,184
<i>-Don't force yourself.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

670
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,023
<i>But you know, your mom, every day,</i>

671
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:22,326
<i>365 days for 20 years,</i>

672
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,195
<i>carried those feelings</i>

673
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,665
<i>while raising you,</i>

674
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,933
<i>Minase.</i>

675
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,237
<i>That's stronger than blood.</i>

676
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,308
-Also.
-Yeah?

677
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,179
Your mom decided to raise you
at 23, right?

678
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,481
We're 20 now.

679
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,851
It's three years from now. That's so soon!

680
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,156
Would a normal person be
prepared for that?

681
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,659
She's so cool.

682
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,531
She's determined and resolved.

683
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,603
-Oh!
-Hey, heads up!

684
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,173
-Watch out! Stop!
-Oh, shit!

685
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,709
You okay?

686
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,578
-I'm fine.
-Yeah?

687
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,166
Yes?

688
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,105
-It's me.
-Hey, welcome home.

689
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,074
I got us Milba.

690
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,577
The new flavor, Violet Apple.

691
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:47,644
Strange!

692
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,315
Milba has some weird flavors
sometimes. They're floundering.

693
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:55,285
I brushed my teeth already.
I'll have it tomorrow.

694
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,653
What were you doing?

695
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,922
Breaststrokes. I need exercise.

696
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,528
Swim at the pool!

697
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,504
You can drown in the pool.

698
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,840
I drowned, and got a D in PE.

699
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,675
Just kidding.

700
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:24,848
Yeah?

701
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,228
Mom.

702
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:40,864
Thank you.

703
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,334
Thank you for everything.

704
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,172
What? Wait.

705
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,607
Who? A boyfriend? Hikaru?

706
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,910
Doctor Wataru? Are you getting married!

707
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,579
Isn't that too early?
Maybe you should wait until graduation.

708
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,781
This is like "Cosmos," right?

709
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,551
-Momoe Yamaguchi's pink "Cosmos."
-What are you saying?

710
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,553
Could it be… Oh no!

711
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,256
-A child, are you having a child?
-Mom.

712
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,192
Stay calm. Your otaku daughter came back

713
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,060
from a bike ride with a classmate.

714
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,729
It's a long path to grandchildren.

715
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,464
I don't think the road even goes there.

716
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,134
And, we live in a prime location in Tokyo.

717
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,536
This house is a keeper.
I'll keep relying on you.

718
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,073
I see. So why are you thanking me?

719
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,909
Thank you for

720
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,111
raising me until now.

721
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,848
I'm so grateful.

722
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,789
No way!

723
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,625
I want to keep raising you!

724
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,460
Or am I already done? You're 20.

725
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,363
No. It's not about that.

726
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,499
You raised me,

727
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,668
even though I'm not your daughter.

728
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,143
I finally know how I feel.

729
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,348
Maybe I made myself understand.

730
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,784
But I felt I needed to thank you.

731
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,954
Sora.

732
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,061
-You want to see a picture of Suzu?
-What?

733
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,733
-She's pretty.
-She looks like you.

734
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,469
You think?

735
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,472
After Suzu passed away,

736
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,641
I…

737
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,511
I couldn't make breastmilk,

738
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,080
so I could only bottle feed you.

739
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,449
But you hated

740
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,919
the smell of rubber.

741
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,290
You wouldn't drink formula.

742
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,864
I thought that you would die!

743
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,068
I was so, so worried

744
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:03,240
that you wouldn't grow up.

745
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,576
Mom.

746
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,946
Mom, don't cry.

747
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,183
I grew up.

748
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,886
Look how big she is!

749
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,957
Sora is alive.

750
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,208
Mom.

751
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,247
I thanked you,

752
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:48,986
but I want to thank

753
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,388
Suzu too.

754
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,560
She gave me life.

755
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,565
Sora.

756
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,003
I wish she could meet me.

757
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:13,110
SUZU HOSHINO'S GRAVE

758
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,945
Sora, I wanted to

759
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,148
bring you here one day.

760
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,087
I'm so glad.

761
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,462
But, the guy who left Suzu.

762
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,899
-That also abandoned you.
-What?

763
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:39,002
This Ichinose guy who disappeared.

764
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,638
-What kind of guy was he?
-Sora?

765
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,574
What kind of guy is he?!

766
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,445
I want to punch him in the face!

767
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,785
Mom!

768
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,754
Where is this Ichinose asshole?

769
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,956
I'll beat him up!

770
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,134
The sky is

771
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,304
beautiful again today.

772
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,675
<i>-We're going to see him.</i>
<i>-We found him. We're going.</i>

773
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,210
<i>I won't give up on Sora.</i>

774
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,979
<i>-Romance is about two people, right?</i>
<i>-Do you love her?</i>

775
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,081
<i>Love Aoi even now?</i>

776
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,116
<i>-Is this your first time fishing?</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

777
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,617
<i>I looked for you!</i>

778
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,985
That girl is

779
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,954
you and Suzu's daughter.

780
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:31,955
