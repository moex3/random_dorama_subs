1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,607
You're not taking a photo?

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,710
I'm waiting for the cloud to move.

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,945
I see.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:12,979
Which cloud?

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,448
That one.

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,318
Don't you get tired?

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,754
It's just the sky.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,923
I think about

9
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,128
what sort of face the sky is making today.

10
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,398
I didn't know the sky had a face.

11
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,734
Oh, you mean expression!

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,171
If that's what you mean, I understand too.

13
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:53,887
TAIYAKI

14
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,122
What? Sora said that?

15
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,858
She wants to meet Fuga Ichinose.

16
00:00:58,925 --> 00:00:59,959
What for?

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,694
To punch him in the face!

18
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,329
I think. I'm not sure.

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,234
Why did you join, Kenta?

20
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,804
We don't know where he is, though.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,305
Hello!

22
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,807
-Hello.
-Hi.

23
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,909
Doctor Wataru, what's that you're holding?

24
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,145
Driftwood, from Ouse Island.

25
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,682
You got driftwood from a mysterious man?

26
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,650
Yes.

27
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,454
I just got sucked in
and before I realized,

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,488
I had bought one.

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,424
I thought it'd match
Odaya's Japanese style.

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,695
-Here's your order.
-You got this at Ouse Island, huh?

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,430
You do scuba diving, right?

32
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,631
Yes.

33
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,067
I wanted to forget about the real world.

34
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,669
The real world?

35
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,871
Well,

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,706
this is awkward to say here,

37
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,609
but lately Sora doesn't seem to be
interested in me.

38
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,313
Huh?

39
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,347
What's wrong?

40
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,717
Oh, no, it's just Sora's
going through a lot right now.

41
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,153
You haven't heard

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,388
anything from Sora, Doctor Wataru?

43
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,023
Nothing.

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,896
Maybe she doesn't want to tell me.

45
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,165
It's not like that.

46
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,634
It's just, you know.

47
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,104
It's not something you can
openly share with others.

48
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,173
Well, that makes me a bit sad.

49
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,144
Because I did think I was her boyfriend.

50
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,615
That was lame.

51
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,583
I'm very lame right now.

52
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
Men get pathetic
and clingy like this so easily.

53
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,521
It's not good.

54
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,623
Well, not all men.

55
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,891
Just me.

56
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,728
Wait! What about the girl you made
the promise with

57
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,163
at the bunny cage?

58
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,934
Huh? Did I misread the room?

59
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,938
I got my <i>taiyaki</i> to go,
so I'll be on my way.

60
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,173
My clients are waiting too.

61
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,108
Oh, really?

62
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,777
Thanks for the driftwood. It's nice.
Wasn't it expensive?

63
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,014
Oh, no worries. From what I heard,
it's a priceless piece.

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,248
But I did get ripped off.

65
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,285
I'm glad you like it.

66
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,620
Thank you, come again.

67
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,424
Shunichiro. Why did you say that?

68
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,427
Because it's obvious that Sora should be

69
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,329
with Hikaru, right?

70
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,832
Sora has very little experience
with romance,

71
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,568
so she may not know

72
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,770
that she should be with Hikaru.

73
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,007
During dark times, whose hand do you
want to hold on to?

74
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,609
Who do you want to lean on?

75
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,712
She might not know that

76
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,480
that's what love is.

77
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,952
It's more likely that she thinks
love is the man you'd want to

78
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,589
go to the beach with in Hawaii
on a bright and sunny day.

79
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,793
Would she ever go to the beach
in Hawaii with a man?

80
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,961
That wasn't the point.

81
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,597
And this driftwood!

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,400
I didn't know people sold these
for a living.

83
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,478
Did something happen?

84
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,150
You don't have to talk about it.

85
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll tell you.

86
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,323
Because you're my boyfriend,
Doctor Wataru.

87
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,463
Mom isn't my birth mom.

88
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,699
She's just the person who raised me.

89
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,238
-What?
-My birth mother died.

90
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,073
It was soon after giving birth to me.

91
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,945
And I have a Dad who lives very far away,
who I've never met.

92
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,081
I shouldn't call him Dad.

93
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,919
I have a birth father who abandoned
my birth mother

94
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,222
and the mother who raised me.

95
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,761
You didn't know this until now?

96
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,531
I found out by chance.

97
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,934
I was overwhelmed by that,

98
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,405
so if I was ever cold to you…

99
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,006
-I'm sorry!
-It's fine.

100
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,843
Were you able to talk with anyone?

101
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,546
My classmate, Irino.

102
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,816
I see.

103
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,988
We were drawing manga together.
So it was by chance.

104
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,623
I don't think so.

105
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,192
What?

106
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,028
I wish I could've done something to help.

107
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,164
Anything.

108
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,434
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,171
But it's not like that with Irino.

110
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,941
He's just a friend. We're not
in love or anything.

111
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,078
Really?

112
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,112
Yes!

113
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,648
And Irino has a supermodel girlfriend.

114
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,949
A girl with high hips.

115
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,884
I think her name is Kokoro.

116
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,822
Plus, he says weird things like
he only likes girls that are

117
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,056
taller than him.

118
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,391
I see.

119
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,394
Anyways,

120
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,163
I want to meet my father.

121
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,565
That's how I feel.

122
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,836
The father who abandoned
my birth mother and foster mother.

123
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,270
He's evil, right?

124
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,339
I want to punch him.

125
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,176
This is a photo of my father
when he was young.

126
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,947
What! Can I take a closer look?

127
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,316
Sure.

128
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,418
Huh? What?

129
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,621
-There are no clues or anything.
-No.

130
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,124
"Fuga Ichinose."

131
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,794
I don't want to Google him.
It feels like I lost.

132
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,996
That makes no sense. Oh, I found him!

133
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,636
<i>Forever with You.</i> It sounds familiar.

134
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,772
It was a really popular show
back in the day.

135
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,241
Fuga Ichinose got his big break from this.

136
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,778
I know this! My mother watched this show.

137
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,649
Are you rubbing how young you are
in my face?

138
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,051
But he hasn't been in anything else
after that.

139
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,755
Yes. He disappeared at the peak
of his stardom.

140
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,723
He retired, maybe?

141
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,793
No one knows what he's doing now, right?

142
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:08,694
I guess so…

143
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,464
No, I'm sure.

144
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,900
What?

145
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,703
He's changed a lot, but he's the man
collecting driftwood at Ouse Island.

146
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,640
-Driftwood?
-Yeah.

147
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,643
-You found him?
-Yeah.

148
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,979
Doctor Wataru found him
collecting driftwood at Ouse Island.

149
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,949
Sorry, that doesn't make sense to me.

150
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,685
But either way,
so you found Fuga Ichinose?

151
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,022
That was his stage name,
so it's not his real name.

152
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,557
Right. Makes sense.

153
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,358
You're gonna go see him?

154
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,627
I found him, so we're going.

155
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,831
I was calling you while packing.

156
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,166
You're treating me so carelessly!

157
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,434
What?

158
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,536
The guy who sold
this driftwood is Fuga Ichinose?

159
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,873
He always did have a shady side,
even back then.

160
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,341
So…

161
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,144
We're going to go see him.

162
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,580
Seriously?

163
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,648
Sora is determined.

164
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,054
Apparently, Doctor Wataru
got a little jealous.

165
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,489
What?

166
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,624
<i>Because I talked about all this with you</i>

167
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,559
<i>and not to him.</i>

168
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
I see.

169
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,930
But it's not like that at all!

170
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,666
Right.

171
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:25,071
You have a supermodel girlfriend
with high hips. Kokoro, right?

172
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,641
Sure do! We're all over each other!

173
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,910
I don't even think of you as a sister.

174
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,679
But you know, Irino?

175
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,781
Having a boyfriend

176
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,486
means someone gets jealous about you!

177
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,788
I said something to him like,
"Sorry I was so cold."

178
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,757
I feel like a powerful woman.

179
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,393
Don't do that. An otaku saying
something like that is cringey.

180
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,795
You're an otaku too.

181
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,467
So is it okay if we wait a bit
until our next manga meeting?

182
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,969
Sure. But first, Fuga Ichinose, right?

183
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,038
Yeah!

184
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,517
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

185
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,888
It's a good thing that Doctor Wataru
asked him where he lives.

186
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,291
Apparently, it's not exactly
where he lives.

187
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,792
What do you mean?

188
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,395
He doesn't have an address.
He's always on the move.

189
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,731
Anyways, I got information
on the residential area of the island.

190
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,633
Residential area?

191
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,803
They went to see him, huh?

192
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,371
Huh?

193
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,143
She went to see her former lover, huh?

194
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,046
Why are you saying it like that?

195
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,317
Here?

196
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,217
Yup.

197
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:50,957
Ring the doorbell.

198
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,459
-Are you joking?
-What?

199
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,165
What, me?

200
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,434
You said you wanted to see him.

201
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:06,872
Wait.

202
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,408
Is my face okay?

203
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,711
Your makeup is pilling.

204
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,212
I'll be back!

205
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,852
Can I help you?

206
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,867
Ichinose!

207
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,606
Long time no see.

208
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,642
It's me, Aoi.

209
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,014
Oh, well…

210
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,782
It's me, Aoi.

211
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,651
Aoi Minase.

212
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,860
Do you not remember me?

213
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,496
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

214
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,503
Mom! Are you okay?

215
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:13,939
"Mom"?

216
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,909
Are you mother and daughter?

217
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,445
Yes.

218
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,383
And you came to talk to me
about something?

219
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,052
Did you come from Tokyo?

220
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,387
Yes.

221
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,166
Would you like to come in?

222
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:48,841
Here you are.

223
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,488
It's good!

224
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,424
It's tea, made from angelica keiskei
I got from the mountain.

225
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,338
I…

226
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm going to go explore outside.

227
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,420
I was in love with you for a week.

228
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,456
I was still 23.

229
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,792
I had just become an adult.

230
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,828
One week…

231
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,900
It may have been a forgettable week
for you.

232
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,702
But for me,

233
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,637
it was a week

234
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,707
that is still vivid in my memory.

235
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,078
After a week,

236
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,414
you disappeared like a ghost.

237
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,183
I looked for you.

238
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,356
And then,

239
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,226
I met Suzu.

240
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,765
I was just

241
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,068
one of many girls for you.

242
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,706
But Suzu…

243
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,178
You remember Suzu Hoshino, right?

244
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,883
Suzu Hoshino…?

245
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:40,853
What?

246
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,924
You don't even remember her?

247
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,761
<i>-Ma?</i>
<i>-"Ma"?</i>

248
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,531
It means "Are you serious?"
It's a Gen Z term my daughter uses.

249
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,366
It's rubbed off on me.

250
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,771
You really don't remember Suzu Hoshino?

251
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,175
She was an actress,
in the same theater troupe as you.

252
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:06,946
Yes.

253
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,248
I remember someone like that.

254
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,617
After all,

255
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,953
it was 20 years ago

256
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,723
when I was acting or in theater troupes.

257
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,429
Suzu passed away.

258
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,903
That girl is Suzu's…

259
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,874
She is your daughter. Her name is Sora.

260
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,479
<i>Suzu</i>

261
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,617
passed away from a heart disease
soon after giving birth to her.

262
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,386
I took her in

263
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,521
and raised her.

264
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,259
You did?

265
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,961
Yes.

266
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,501
I'm sorry for

267
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,170
not remembering.

268
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,242
It's fine.

269
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,614
Excuse me.

270
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,551
I know this is weird to ask,

271
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,024
but I'm a writer,
and I have a deadline today.

272
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,194
Can I do a bit of work here?

273
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,431
Sure.

274
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,334
Go ahead.

275
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,496
Are you okay?

276
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,936
Did you find something?

277
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,713
A striped shore crab.

278
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,131
Here's a good one.

279
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,740
I will clean this.

280
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,553
The weak areas are decaying,
so it peels right off.

281
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,492
Driftwood with a sturdy center
is a good one.

282
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,695
Isn't it…

283
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,336
Isn't it lonely living alone
in a place like this?

284
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,574
It is lonely.

285
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,979
How many years?

286
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,314
How many years does it take

287
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,550
for a sturdy center to form?

288
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,055
I'm not sure. Two or three years?

289
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,757
Or maybe more.

290
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,661
Through nature's force,

291
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,463
it can bump into rocks,

292
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,131
or be swallowed by waves,

293
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,001
and be beaten against the shore.

294
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,103
The more time passes,

295
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,272
the stronger the driftwood gets.

296
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,143
It gets stronger the more it travels.

297
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,147
You can only get strong

298
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,650
by bumping into rocks and getting

299
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,452
beaten against the shore.

300
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,424
I want to try.

301
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,892
Yes.

302
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,295
Go ahead.

303
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,679
<i>Ms. Aoi, are you listening?</i>

304
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,214
<i>Ms. Aoi?</i>

305
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,182
Sorry.

306
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,718
<i>The manuscript is due at four today.</i>

307
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,388
Yes. I'll send it over by then.

308
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,890
I'm sorry, at a time like this.

309
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,058
Not at all.

310
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,194
The series for <i>Midsummer Skies</i>
<i>are Dreams</i> is starting soon.

311
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,562
I have to push through.

312
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,033
I want to start with something like,
"The salamander was sad."

313
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,536
What do you mean?

314
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,139
It's Masuji Ibuse. You don't know?

315
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,974
<i>Of course I know him, but…</i>

316
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,210
I want to start with
a powerful first sentence.

317
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,515
I see. I'm sure Masuji Ibuse
also thought, "Score!"

318
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,750
when he thought of that sentence.

319
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,152
I'm sure he did.

320
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,125
And how is it going over there?

321
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,562
It's not going anywhere.

322
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,697
Fuga Ichinose forgot about me.

323
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,667
-No way!
-Yes, way.

324
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,104
And he pretended to forget about
Suzu, too.

325
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,607
What I thought was one week
of fateful love

326
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,510
was only an ordinary week for him.

327
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,680
Monday to Sunday. Seven days. One week.

328
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,783
I'm sure he had many other women.

329
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,818
To spice up his performance, or whatever.

330
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,355
He was an actor, right?

331
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,926
I heard from Mom. Why is it that
after you got famous,

332
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,460
and got a big break,

333
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,263
that you quit the industry
at the peak of your stardom?

334
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,800
Not the industry, but I quit acting.

335
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,670
Right.

336
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,841
It got boring after I got famous.

337
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
What?

338
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,515
I heard a gong sound
going, "Ring! It's over!"

339
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,119
I got caught up in the numbers
of sales and popularity.

340
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,759
I was fully booked, from morning to night.

341
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,896
My manager would circle around me,

342
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,698
like a satellite revolving
around a planet.

343
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,067
I would buy a big house.

344
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,069
But I couldn't move from there.

345
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,239
Even the lines

346
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,609
written in the script felt like
I was being trapped.

347
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,280
Why do I have to say something
I don't agree with?

348
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,781
Am I a robot?

349
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,684
Why did you want to become an actor, then?

350
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,193
-Sorry.
-No.

351
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,095
You're exactly right.

352
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,899
Sora, are you a college student?

353
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,769
Yes. I'm still in school.

354
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,106
You have a long future ahead.

355
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,776
Here.

356
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,681
Let's go fishing for our dinner.

357
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,517
If we're lucky, we can get
a largescale blackfish.

358
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,690
-Let's get something to eat.
-Sure.

359
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,292
I want something sweet.

360
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,192
-Hi.
-Something sweet?

361
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,528
Hey, nose hair.

362
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,264
How long will you call me that?

363
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,066
ODAYA

364
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,134
What do you want?

365
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,936
Why are your friends here too?

366
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,838
They want the <i>taiyaki</i> here.

367
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,707
What would you like?

368
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,809
-One <i>taiyaki</i> and yakisoba, please.
-Alright.

369
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,011
-I want to try the <i>sanmayaki.</i>
-Oh, sounds good.

370
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,112
Coming right up.

371
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,514
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

372
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,450
I'm not giving up on Sora.

373
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,454
-What?
-Don't "What?" me.

374
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,957
What would you like?

375
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:06,958
<i>-Sanmayaki.</i>
<i>-Sanmayaki.</i>

376
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,961
You have the same tastes.

377
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,029
-We don't.
-We don't.

378
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,566
Alright.

379
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,471
There's nothing between Sora and me.

380
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,574
But you call her Sora.

381
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,178
Hello?

382
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,447
Sora, you're so popular!

383
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,482
What?

384
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,985
Right now Hikaru
and Doctor Wataru are at Odaya,

385
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,954
and they're fighting over you!

386
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,988
No way.

387
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,891
This makes no sense.

388
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,227
-You declaring war on me.
-Why?

389
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,162
Romance is about two people.

390
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,298
It happens with two people,
in a closed room.

391
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,033
There's no space for a third party.

392
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,404
You're on a different level than me.

393
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,240
If you like her, you should just tell her.

394
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,175
I see.

395
00:22:58,744 --> 00:22:59,811
You know,

396
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,014
I'm not really experienced with
these type of things.

397
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,418
I've been treating old people
as a chiropractor, and now I'm 25.

398
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,521
Sorry. I just happened to overhear.

399
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,090
-Don't eavesdrop.
-It wasn't on purpose!

400
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,627
This guy has nothing to do with
Sora Minase.

401
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,929
They haven't even held hands.

402
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,232
I've held hands.

403
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,568
You're winning! By a long shot!

404
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,337
So have confidence.

405
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,640
Was that your friend calling?

406
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,511
It seems I'm popular with the boys now.

407
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:33,945
What?

408
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,547
Never mind.

409
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,084
It's because you're pretty.

410
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,854
But I'm an otaku.

411
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,292
It doesn't matter.
If you're pretty, you're pretty.

412
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,461
What?

413
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,066
You got all the girls, right?

414
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,905
No, that's not true.

415
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,444
You toyed with my birth mother
and my foster mother.

416
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,782
That's a bit harsh.

417
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,754
Oh? Is it pulling?

418
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,656
You're right!

419
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,991
It's pulling… Huh?

420
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,526
Is this your first time fishing?

421
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:22,861
Yes!

422
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,831
A live fish? A live fish is coming, right?

423
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,934
-You're reeling it the wrong way.
-What?

424
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,901
Reel it in harder.

425
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,436
-Oh, this way?
-Yes, keep reeling.

426
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,839
-Yes!
-Just like that.

427
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,740
-Wow!
-Nice!

428
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,543
I came to ask if you have Wi-Fi.

429
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,444
Wi-Fi?

430
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,247
The internet!

431
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,649
Without the internet,
I can't send my manuscript.

432
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,784
What's the internet?

433
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,252
Mom, he's clueless.

434
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,787
He lives like a caveman.

435
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,988
He fishes for his food.

436
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:52,624
I was joking.

437
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,162
ENTER THE SECURITY CODE

438
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,397
Here you are.

439
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,167
Wow, fish!

440
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,671
It's fresh.

441
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,245
Wow.

442
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,952
You're a hard worker.

443
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,021
Sure.

444
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,724
But I just have to type it out
and send it.

445
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,326
Take your time.

446
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,531
I'm going to prepare dinner now.

447
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,165
What, dinner?

448
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,670
I'll pitch a tent and sleep outside.

449
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,238
You two can sleep here.

450
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,341
We're sleeping here?

451
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,546
It's a tiny world.

452
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,983
The ten centimeter radius

453
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,952
of your ten fingers.

454
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,324
I collect driftwood from around
the world here.

455
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,097
They all have different shapes,

456
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,167
with different histories.

457
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,241
Histories that floated here.

458
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:21,313
True, Mom's work is nothing
like picking up driftwood.

459
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,915
It's a small world.

460
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,685
It's just Mom's small head
that is involved.

461
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,788
There might not be much in her brain.

462
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,423
Hey!

463
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,794
But the world she creates from there
is really big.

464
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,397
It's infinite. It makes many people happy.

465
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,208
She grew up to be a good girl.

466
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,016
<i>MIDSUMMER SKIES ARE DREAMS</i> - AOI MINASE

467
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,053
Oh, it's nice. The intro's catchy.

468
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,823
She got the inspiration
from Ibuse's <i>Salamander.</i>

469
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,759
"Mom died two weeks ago.

470
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,528
I haven't been able to cry for two weeks."

471
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,496
What does this mean?

472
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,697
I don't know either.

473
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,899
A writer's head is unique,

474
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,135
so it must connect with
the story later on.

475
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,774
But now, we can take this to Lemon Page
and have them print her name really big.

476
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,675
Yes, sir.

477
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,645
Looks like it's the return of Aoi Minase.

478
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,247
Alright! Let's go out for drinks!

479
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,820
Come on. Join us once in a while, Soseki!

480
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,358
Hey, you actually have a pretty cute face!

481
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,928
You remind me of someone.

482
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,699
There was this kid who could never finish
his milk and had to stay at the table.

483
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,300
You look like him.

484
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,869
I hope Takeshi's doing alright.

485
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,038
I'm sorry. I need to go somewhere today.

486
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,275
You're just going to go home
and watch Hulu, right?

487
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,077
Why Hulu?

488
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,780
That's behind the scenes stuff, okay?

489
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,482
-It's fine. Hey, Tayama!
-Yes?

490
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,617
-Let's go drink.
-Yes, sir!

491
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,787
-Hello, welcome!
-Welcome.

492
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,055
Are you still open?

493
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,790
Yes, come in.

494
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,126
Here you are.

495
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,896
Are you back from Aoi's place?

496
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,064
Oh, no.

497
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,799
Right. She's at Ouse Island now.

498
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,801
I just happened to be in the area.

499
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,070
Why?

500
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,304
There are a lot of good restaurants
nearby.

501
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,672
Why choose this place?

502
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,508
-I hope I didn't inconvenience you.
-Oh, no.

503
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,344
You're a customer.
You're not an inconvenience.

504
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,013
Customers are everything.

505
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,984
Or did you come to see your ex? Sally?

506
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,953
Sally went with Shunichiro,

507
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,956
my father, to the Suzuran Hot Springs.
It's nearby.

508
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,526
I think they're getting dinner
and drinks after.

509
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,028
They're so in love.

510
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,333
Did I hurt you? Did I pick at old wounds?

511
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,068
-I'm sorry!
-No, it's fine.

512
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,970
I'm over Sally.

513
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,773
-As long as she's happy.
-No, I'm sorry.

514
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,608
That was so rude of me.

515
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,177
Aoi always says
I am the most insensitive guy ever.

516
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,213
Let me let you eat. Go ahead.

517
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,214
Oh, no.

518
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,750
Please join me.

519
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:13,885
Really?

520
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,021
You know, maybe the reason
I came here is because

521
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,058
I wanted to talk to someone I know.

522
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,160
I don't have any other place to go.

523
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,196
Really?

524
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,133
Being alone can be rough
during the winter.

525
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,035
-Kenta, can you get me a cup?
-Yes, sir!

526
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,571
-Marshmallows?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

527
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,574
<i>You know how you roast them while camping?</i>

528
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,576
I've only seen it on TV until now.

529
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,011
And you pitched a tent?

530
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,515
Yeah, but only Ichinose
will be staying here.

531
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,651
We also ate the fish we caught.

532
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,921
<i>And we also ate</i>
<i>napa cabbage and pork hot pot.</i>

533
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,223
<i>Ichinose bought those ingredients.</i>

534
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,425
Also, we caught some clams
and grilled them

535
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,894
with soy sauce and butter too!

536
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,562
That sounds good.

537
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,832
We're having tea soon.

538
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,068
The stars are pretty.

539
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,038
And how is Fuga Ichinose?

540
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,377
He's a strange man.

541
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:13,878
You punch him yet?

542
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,848
How do I put it…?

543
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,151
He's on a different plane of existence.

544
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,289
Like a whale shark at the aquarium.

545
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,893
Hey,

546
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,128
why are you calling me about all this?

547
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,833
Shouldn't you be calling your boyfriend?

548
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,101
Should I not call you?

549
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,672
No, it's fine with me, but…

550
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,275
I wasn't doing anything anyway.
So it's fine.

551
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,381
I was told to keep this a secret from you,

552
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,516
but I saw Doctor Wataru today.

553
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,418
You're telling me.

554
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,186
I'm keeping some details a secret.

555
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,156
I ran into him by chance at Odaya.

556
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,227
-I see.
<i>-You guys held hands, right?</i>

557
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,097
If you held hands,
that means you're dating.

558
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,535
That's so innocent. It's unlike you.

559
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,271
You like Doctor Wataru, right?
So call him.

560
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,672
-What?
<i>-Bye.</i>

561
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,442
Hey, wait…

562
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,413
What's with him?

563
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,851
I'm so immature!

564
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,789
You can get hot water from here.

565
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,332
You seem to be getting along well.

566
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,136
With Sora.

567
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,772
She's a city girl,

568
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,574
so she's never gone fishing.

569
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,044
Ichinose! The campfire's about to go out.

570
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:54,879
Right. Coming.

571
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,552
-Check it out.
-Yes?

572
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,587
-That.
-Okay.

573
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,090
It's driftwood that Fuga Ichinose found.

574
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,960
It feels wrong somehow.

575
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,295
What do you mean?

576
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,564
It's shady to sell driftwood
that you found, right?

577
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,702
It feels more honest to make
and sell <i>taiyaki.</i>

578
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,137
Right? We use flour.

579
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,639
Flour and bean paste.
At least you know where it comes from.

580
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,943
She's too naive, don't you think?

581
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,011
Ms. Aoi is?

582
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:27,912
Yeah.

583
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,449
She got dumped by a guy,
and raised his girl's kid.

584
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,151
I mean it's Sora, but she raised her.

585
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,788
Now, Sora wants to meet her dad
and Aoi's taking her.

586
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,427
Maybe Ms. Aoi wanted to see Ichinose too.

587
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,195
What do you mean?

588
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,432
Because she said it was a great love.

589
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,767
I fell in love.

590
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,871
It was different from any love
I've experienced.

591
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,609
It was an all-consuming love,
like I was struck by lightning.

592
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,611
But he forgot about her.

593
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:01,946
What?

594
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,415
He didn't remember?

595
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,950
Yes. She told me on the phone.

596
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,456
You look happy.

597
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,624
She's like that.

598
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,027
-Like an idol, you know?
-Huh?

599
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,530
When she was in her early twenties,
she was always smart and pretty.

600
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,600
She was likable too.
Not snobby or anything.

601
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,802
-Right.
-She went to a good high school.

602
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:25,970
To a good college.

603
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,806
And she wrote a novel
and debuted as an author.

604
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:29,707
Yes.

605
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,543
She didn't have to work her way up.

606
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,579
Just like an idol

607
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,581
that got scouted in Harajuku.

608
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,683
Placed on a pedestal
with the ladder removed.

609
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,252
-We didn't do that!
-But now she can't climb down.

610
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,755
And she's forced to wear ballerina shoes.

611
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,424
She's a ballerina that has to dance
until she dies.

612
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,028
She didn't need to be that great.

613
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,630
She should've married me
and made <i>taiyaki</i> with me at Odaya.

614
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,503
Do you love her?

615
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,104
Even now?

616
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,514
You do love her.

617
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,287
You never get bored of

618
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:17,955
looking at this, right?

619
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,462
Everyone's faces are pretty.

620
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,665
Don't you think?

621
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:31,736
You're right.

622
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,809
Soseki? Soseki, wake up.

623
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,545
Just let him sleep.
He'll go home tomorrow morning.

624
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,514
He can't drink, you know.

625
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,755
<i>I can't get away</i>

626
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,725
<i>From the phone</i>

627
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,031
<i>I know I can't</i>

628
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,368
<i>Hear your voice ever again</i>

629
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:13,945
Sora.

630
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,483
I thought you were wrong.

631
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,585
What?

632
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,086
<i>Imagine.</i>

633
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,157
Reach your hand out in the darkness.

634
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,893
Wait.

635
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,294
You're being weird.

636
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,397
-Where are you right now, Sally?
<i>-At Odaya.</i>

637
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,834
Soseki can't drink, but he did,
and now he's asleep.

638
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,936
What? Soseki?

639
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,106
<i>He doesn't wake up once he goes to sleep.</i>

640
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,143
He smells nostalgic.

641
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,545
Like the man I knew.

642
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,480
What are you doing, Sally?

643
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,650
I'm comparing them.

644
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,753
How it feels to be held by Shunichiro

645
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,555
and Soseki.

646
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,191
<i>In whose arms do I feel more safe?</i>

647
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,293
<i>In whose arms do I belong?</i>

648
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,596
Why are you comparing them now?

649
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,398
I thought you'd decided.

650
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,700
There's no such thing as time with love.

651
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,003
When it goes back, it goes back.

652
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,437
Time jumps

653
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,606
very easily.

654
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,546
I don't really get it, but…

655
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,749
That's deep.

656
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,417
You're a pro at this.

657
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,787
Being in the arms of an ex is

658
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,756
different from love.

659
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,894
It's like a bird

660
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,831
resting in an old nest.

661
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,069
So it's Shunichiro, isn't it?

662
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,139
But my heart fluttered a bit.

663
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,044
Because Shunichiro's upstairs.

664
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,514
Be careful with the risky games.

665
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,516
Sora.

666
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,652
Reach out in the darkness.

667
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,262
<i>Your hand touches someone's shoulder,</i>

668
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:12,930
<i>and you feel safe.</i>

669
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,601
That's the person

670
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,203
you need the most, Sora.

671
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,476
Is that what love is?

672
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,511
It's my opinion.

673
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,814
Just one of the theories out there.

674
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,450
Roger that.

675
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:37,755
Sally.

676
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,961
I hope you find happiness.

677
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,700
You too.

678
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:54,572
I liked how you were left-handed.

679
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,575
Don't change it.

680
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,181
It's too late for that.

681
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,555
<i>That man is my dad.</i>

682
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,223
<i>My father.</i>

683
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:55,966
Can't sleep?

684
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,070
No.

685
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,742
You want a drink?

686
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,246
It's good.

687
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,683
Is it? I'm glad.

688
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,386
This shochu

689
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,055
was made on this island.

690
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,462
What do you usually drink, Sora?

691
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,964
I don't really drink.

692
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,566
Just some limoncello.

693
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,369
What is that?

694
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,404
It's a lemon alcohol.

695
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,872
It's good.

696
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,610
It's probably not for me.

697
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,445
I'm not good with sweets.

698
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,582
How do you know it's sweet?

699
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,053
Lemoncello sounds like a sweet drink.

700
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,289
It's limoncello, not lemon.

701
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,097
Are you cold?

702
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,200
No.

703
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,485
It feels nice outside.

704
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:31,762
Can I hear the rest of your story?

705
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,432
What was it?

706
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:35,900
So,

707
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,803
you quit acting at your peak,

708
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,904
and after that…

709
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,040
Driftwood?

710
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,443
No.

711
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,979
Let's see.

712
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,752
I earned many things from becoming famous,

713
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,089
so I decided to get rid of many things.

714
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,760
I got rid of my money.

715
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,162
I donated it all.

716
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,933
I got rid of my house.

717
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,435
I got rid of everything.

718
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,172
But I pick up driftwood.

719
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:19,877
Just kidding.

720
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,950
I only started picking up driftwood
about ten years ago.

721
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,187
I did many things during that time.

722
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,623
Many things?

723
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,058
Yes.

724
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,262
I opened a lodge in a tropical island.

725
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,432
I sang songs.

726
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,068
-Songs?
-Yes.

727
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:45,402
On the streets.

728
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,638
Like a street musician.

729
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,243
I tried many things,

730
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,480
and went to many places.

731
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,151
Can you live doing that?

732
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,292
Sora.

733
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,062
It's possible to live without money.

734
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,266
As long as there are people.

735
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,669
-People?
-Yes.

736
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,840
People who help you.

737
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,743
People you want to help.

738
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,579
A give-and-take relationship.

739
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,749
I traveled to many places

740
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,817
and met many people.

741
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,453
I somehow

742
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,389
was able to survive.

743
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,692
I woke up, and worked.

744
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,495
When night came,

745
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,599
I ate a little bit of good food,
and slept.

746
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,405
You didn't want to do something?

747
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,407
Like a dream, maybe?

748
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,511
My dream was

749
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,513
to be an actor.

750
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,619
My dream ended when I was 33.

751
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,522
Since it came true.

752
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,424
And,

753
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,960
I felt trapped, so…

754
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,367
I got rid of my house.

755
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,935
And,

756
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,638
I traveled to many different places.

757
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,909
You can live anywhere.

758
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,848
I made the whole world my home.

759
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,353
The whole world was your home?

760
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,253
Yes.

761
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:46,991
Like a migratory bird.

762
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,029
Migratory birds travel the distance
of half the Earth

763
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,798
in a single year, with their small bodies.

764
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,569
The whole world is their home.

765
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,139
That's nice.

766
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,618
What's going on?

767
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,122
Do they get along because they're related?

768
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,060
Shoot.

769
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,629
Will I ever stop being
overly-attached to my kid?

770
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:28,632
I'm sleeping.

771
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:08,939
It's late!

772
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,783
Do you know this song?

773
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,019
No.

774
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,587
It's called "Will You Dance?"

775
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,323
It's nice.

776
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:32,930
Do you want to dance?

777
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,866
-What?
-Let's dance.

778
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,068
No, no. I can't.

779
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,137
I've never danced in my life.

780
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:42,639
Then,

781
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,242
let's dance for the first time.

782
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,012
No, I can't.

783
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,182
What?

784
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,597
Really?

785
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,176
SORA MINASE

786
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,921
The stars are pretty, huh?

787
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,856
How nice.

788
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,797
What are you drawing?

789
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:40,864
Mom.

790
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:41,899
What?

791
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,902
I'm so happy!

792
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,974
Where's Mr. Elephant?

793
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,310
Hey. Yum.

794
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,611
Today's egg is pretty good.

795
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,746
Seriously?

796
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,185
-It's good!
-Yeah!

797
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,854
-Mom, hurry up!
-I'm sorry!

798
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:05,823
Alright.

799
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,692
-The camera!
-I'll get it!

800
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:09,593
SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

801
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,395
SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

802
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,578
Princess! I've brought
a mountain of treasure

803
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,813
to obtain Sora.

804
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,382
Tiffany, Harry Winston, Bulgari!

805
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,786
I brought clothes, bags, and shoes.

806
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,454
You can dress up how you please

807
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,723
anytime you want, like a Barbie doll.

808
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,426
Prada, Gucci, Margiela!

809
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,328
Saint Laurent, Stella, Celine, Bottega!

810
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,296
I have some registration documents.

811
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,932
Hawaii, New Zealand, Gold Coast,
and Switzerland.

812
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,734
All vacation homes.

813
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,171
I'll also give you
an ancient castle in Europe.

814
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,574
Princess! I have a signed copy of
<i>Happy Kanako.</i>

815
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,475
<i>HAPPY KANAKO</i>

816
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,077
And a treasure box,

817
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,346
containing early sketches for
<i>Chainsaw Man.</i>

818
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,147
Limited figures, sold out at Comiket.

819
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,916
A complete set of <i>Edens Zero,</i>
all fully painted.

820
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,050
Finally,

821
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:10,787
a limited illustrated Band-Aid of
<i>Cells at Work!</i> only in Village Vanguard.

822
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,324
Your favorite character, White Blood Cell,
is in there as well.

823
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,126
No, Sora!

824
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,563
Real estate. Always go for real estate!

825
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,764
I have

826
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,033
a complete set of

827
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,903
all flavors of Milba,
also known as Milk and Violet.

828
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,604
All flavors from the past and future.

829
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,740
This is called

830
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,277
Sexual Violet.

831
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,478
What does it taste like?

832
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,579
No, I have to

833
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,616
return to the moon.

834
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:43,654
I cannot accept anyone's proposal.

835
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,223
You're going to the moon?

836
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,793
You took me in when you found me
in a glowing bamboo

837
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,261
in the forest and raised me.

838
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,263
I didn't do that.

839
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,231
That was a lie.

840
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,033
No need for that. Step away.

841
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,770
You mean, "Come closer!"

842
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,073
Bye, Mom!

843
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,576
I thought Princess Kaguya took
an ox cart home.

844
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,111
Are we suddenly in Arabian Nights?

845
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:09,880
Thank you for everything.

846
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,381
Hey, wait!

847
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,424
Just a dream?

848
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,828
Of course

849
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,697
it was a dream.

850
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:39,409
<i>Mom, I decided to travel with Fuga.</i>

851
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,911
<i>Be well! I'll call you.</i>

852
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,148
He took her.

853
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:09,139
WE'LL SHOW YOU BEHIND THE SCENES
OF <i>DATE MY DAUGHTER!</i>

854
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,516
Mom! Are you okay?

855
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,351
Okay.

856
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,875
REHEARSAL

857
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,344
Can I try? Will it mess up your hair?

858
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,311
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

859
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,447
You'll treasure this memory forever!

860
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,532
-Aoi Minase.
-What?

861
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,734
<i>But he's fun to be with.</i>

862
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,803
<i>So that's Fuga Ichinose, huh?</i>

863
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:13,770
It's an honor

864
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,105
to be sent to Saneisha in New York.

865
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,039
<i>What is it?</i>

866
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,808
<i>I'll smell your scent.</i>

867
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,576
<i>You chased us all the way here.</i>

868
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,078
<i>What do you want?</i>

869
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,045
