1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,435
He took her?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,771
He kidnapped her?

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,374
She's not coming back?

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,777
-No one said that!
-Oh, sorry.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,979
I saw this letter.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,851
"Hey Mom, I decided to travel a bit
with Fuga.

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,886
Be well. I'll call you."

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,655
This "Be well" seems to have
a deeper meaning.

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,190
Don't say things like that!

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,394
I don't know what to do
if she doesn't come home ever again.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,863
He's a phony.

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,031
Or is he evil?

13
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,300
That Fuga Ichinose, he's a crafty one!

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,469
It'll be fine.
She'll most likely come back.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,073
What do you mean, "most likely"?
Not "certainly"?

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,841
Say certainly!

17
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,176
Hello!

18
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,746
I knew you were here.

19
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,449
Hey, you!

20
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,785
I have a souvenir from Okinawa.

21
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,319
Okinawa?

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,788
You were in Okinawa, Sora?

23
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,590
Okinawa donuts and a <i>shisa.</i>

24
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,392
Mom, your souvenir is at home.

25
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,860
We're decorating now.

26
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,530
Decorating? Who is?

27
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,606
Looks pretty good.

28
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,942
MAIN TITLE

29
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,812
You were in Okinawa for all four days?

30
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,014
Yes. We rode a hot air balloon.

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,050
Ichinose said there was a place
we could ride it in Okinawa.

32
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,854
After that, we ate Okinawa soba.

33
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,924
Why didn't you call me?

34
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,761
I thought you'd tell me to come home.

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,131
Mom,

36
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,233
you're still mad

37
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,968
at Ichinose, right?

38
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,138
You were mad too.

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,042
But he's

40
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,377
a little fun to be with.

41
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,482
Welcome home.

42
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,550
We're home.

43
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,159
Not bad!

44
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,293
Right?

45
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:09,896
Right?

46
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,334
I don't really get it.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,269
You'll start to get it.

48
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,470
The beauty of driftwood.

49
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,074
I'll be on my way, then.
I don't want to interrupt

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,709
quality family time.

51
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,911
-Where are you going?
-Home?

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,350
I found good lodgings.

53
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,952
A toy store? The one in the corner?

54
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,654
Across from the soba shop?

55
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,588
Yeah.

56
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,423
Do you know yo-yo?

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,893
Yo-yo? The toy?

58
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,129
<i>He befriended Granny Obayashi with that.</i>

59
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,198
You're so good!

60
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,834
Is this fine? It's not much.

61
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,136
It's very nice.

62
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,272
This is the ideal room.

63
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,439
Apparently, he was already

64
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,743
asked to do interiors for Taiyou-Do,
where Doctor Wataru works.

65
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,546
<i>He was asked to decorate it</i>
<i>Asian style, with driftwood.</i>

66
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,713
Wow!

67
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,348
This is very nice!

68
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,217
He even found a job.

69
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,552
This soccer ball?

70
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,188
-Oh, let me help.
<i>-I'm sure his rent is super cheap.</i>

71
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,088
It's 1,100 yen.

72
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,292
He's got great survival
and communication skills.

73
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,160
Yeah. And then,

74
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,930
<i>he got permission to park his car</i>
<i>inside Hikawa Shrine.</i>

75
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,865
<i>He even sells driftwood there.</i>

76
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,767
<i>And people buy it!</i>

77
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,037
I've never seen anyone like that.

78
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,739
Even in Okinawa, he got stuff
for free from people!

79
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,241
That's what you noticed?

80
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,143
He found a big job

81
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
to do the interiors
for a resort hotel there.

82
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,148
He's very skilled at living life.

83
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,850
I'm bad at stuff like that.

84
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,787
Most kids these days are.

85
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,289
You're a kid these days too!

86
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,391
Oh, that's true, I am.

87
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,095
I've never met

88
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,564
someone that's

89
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:53,900
quite like him.

90
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,604
I think I should keep observing him.

91
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,374
Not because he's your father?

92
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,410
The fact that he's my father

93
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,878
must have some meaning, right?

94
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,450
I just thought

95
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,819
you were very much Aoi Minase's daughter.

96
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,922
Well, not by blood.

97
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,890
What do you mean?

98
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,093
You have a unique perspective on things.

99
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,095
Is it strange?

100
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,864
No, it's a compliment.
I meant it as a compliment.

101
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,900
Hey, I'm really taking this to
Jump, alright?

102
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,902
Oh, in that case.

103
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,506
Should we submit this
to a new talent contest?

104
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,141
-New talent contest?
-It's this.

105
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,876
SUZURAN SHOPPING DISTRICT

106
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,978
MEN, WOMEN

107
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,048
Hello!

108
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,584
Aoi. Long time no see.

109
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,255
I couldn't write, so I came here
to feel refreshed.

110
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,491
It felt so nice!

111
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,427
Aoi.

112
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,030
Aoi Minase.

113
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,834
Won't you come up?

114
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,141
Ms. Minase!

115
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,077
Ms. Aoi!

116
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,146
Stop it!

117
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,747
Everyone's watching!

118
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,916
What? I can't hear.

119
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,853
Aoi!

120
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,222
OBAYASHI TOYS

121
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,894
So you came.

122
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,635
This is Ryugu Sake, from Okinawa.

123
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,236
You want some?

124
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,306
What do you want from us?

125
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,278
You chased us all the way here,

126
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,713
and then you stayed.

127
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,782
What do you want from us?

128
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,787
What do you think?

129
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,524
Hey, I made some

130
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,194
daikon radish and squid stew.

131
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,529
Please have some.

132
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,665
Wow, it looks good!

133
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,569
Here.

134
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,638
-Chopsticks for you, Aoi.
-Oh, no, I…

135
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,607
I heard you know each other.

136
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,809
Aoi used to be

137
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,778
our customer back in the day.

138
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,315
After that, it was Sora.

139
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,417
-Join us, Kanae.
-What?

140
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,588
I prefer to be alone.
I feel more relaxed that way.

141
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,224
I'll eat this on my own while watching TV.

142
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,627
But Aoi, having him here with me,

143
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,197
he's like a bodyguard. I feel so safe!

144
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,966
I'll protect you from anything.

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,567
Including the bad men?

146
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,836
Because you're so beautiful.

147
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,807
I didn't think my radishes

148
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,610
would buy all this flattery!

149
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,046
-It's true, you know!
-Alright.

150
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,816
Right?

151
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,921
The fact that Kanae of Obayashi Toys
is beautiful

152
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,323
has been said by everyone
in Suzuran District for many years.

153
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,292
You're beautiful too.

154
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,102
-It's good.
-Right?

155
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,438
This is

156
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,406
a very rare sake.

157
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,876
They rest unprocessed awamori sake
for 20 years to get this aged sake.

158
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,978
They're very hard to come by.

159
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,684
I'll have some of Kanae's radishes.

160
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,988
Good, right?

161
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,659
I'm going home soon.

162
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,595
Oh!

163
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,131
RYUGU

164
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,166
Want to play this?

165
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,569
Doing it alone is boring.

166
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,604
No, thank you.

167
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,178
If I play this and win,

168
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,113
will you go back to Ouse Island quickly?

169
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,281
I see.

170
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,984
Sure. I'm fine with that.

171
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,586
You promise?

172
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,020
Yes.

173
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,356
Let's play.

174
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,083
You're doing it again.

175
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,119
You try to take the risky one
in the middle.

176
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,890
You haven't changed.

177
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,433
I won.

178
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,071
I think I'll stay for a little longer.

179
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,909
Why?

180
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,679
Why did you lie about forgetting me?

181
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,016
Why did you lie?

182
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,624
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,464
When you came to see me…

184
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,700
Long time no see.

185
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,769
It's me, Aoi.

186
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,005
<i>Sora's eyes</i>

187
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,274
looked exactly like Suzu's.

188
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,579
It was like Suzu was standing
right in front of me.

189
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,818
I couldn't say that I remembered you.

190
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,387
So I lied.

191
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,590
Also,

192
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,260
I was hesitant because you came to see me

193
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,562
so suddenly.

194
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,466
To be honest, I was shocked.

195
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,269
I couldn't imagine

196
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,305
that it was reality.

197
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,813
I'm so sorry.

198
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,650
You supported Suzu.

199
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,454
And to think

200
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,657
that you

201
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,592
raised Suzu's child.

202
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,998
We became

203
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,001
best friends.

204
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,670
What?

205
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,772
Suzu and me.

206
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,709
Two women with the same scars.

207
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,080
We were two people

208
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,283
who couldn't forget you.

209
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,121
Yes, you were a terrible man.

210
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,524
You had many other women.

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,962
Maybe to others,

212
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,198
you were a worthless shithead.

213
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,602
Yes. I was a worthless shithead.

214
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,371
But you had a charm that
surpassed the bad parts.

215
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,877
Love can be like that, you know?

216
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,981
Like, "Why do I even like someone
like this?"

217
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,051
That's why

218
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,822
neither Suzu nor I

219
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,725
wanted to deny

220
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,261
falling in love with you.

221
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,099
That's why Suzu

222
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,202
decided to have Sora.

223
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,506
I never said this

224
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,143
to Suzu,

225
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,179
but I always thought,

226
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,153
"Why does Suzu get to have your child,

227
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,393
and I can't?"

228
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,400
It was frustrating.

229
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,739
That's how much

230
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,310
I loved you.

231
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,385
Of course, it's all in the past.

232
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,458
But even so, I'm crying.

233
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,360
It's very strange.

234
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,398
But…

235
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,602
Why?

236
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,639
Why weren't you with her?

237
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,577
Why didn't you stay with Suzu?

238
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,580
Don't you know how scary it is

239
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,550
for a woman to have a child all alone?

240
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,952
And she was sick!

241
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,623
Fuga!

242
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,098
Can I punch you?

243
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,637
Yes.

244
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,784
That is for Suzu.

245
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,557
Um…

246
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,594
I have a favor to ask.

247
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,833
You punched him?

248
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,134
More like a slap.

249
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,335
My hand still hurts.

250
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,103
Is Ichinose okay?

251
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,371
You're worried about him?

252
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,674
Nah. But Ichinose didn't know

253
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,511
that Suzu was pregnant
with his kid, right?

254
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,346
By kid, I mean me.

255
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,148
He didn't know.

256
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,649
So it's not his fault.

257
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,852
It is his fault!

258
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,954
It's his fault for abandoning
his girlfriends!

259
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,356
But he remembered.

260
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,825
Both you and Suzu, right?

261
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,028
He did remember.

262
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,097
I'm glad.

263
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,268
I'm glad he remembered my two moms.

264
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,906
Hey, you're too soft on Ichinose.

265
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,507
Did he brainwash you?

266
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,710
His handsomeness

267
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,045
reminds me of Itachi Uchiha from Naruto.

268
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,146
It's too powerful.

269
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,716
Mom.

270
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,551
I want to go again.

271
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,289
If you, Ichinose, and I

272
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,925
visited her all together,

273
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,261
I'm sure Mother Suzu would feel relieved

274
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,129
in heaven,

275
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,797
up in the sky.

276
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,970
HOSHINO FAMILY

277
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,422
The weather is nice.

278
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,723
It's cold.

279
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,294
Want to go warm up?

280
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,364
Want to go to a hot spring?

281
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,565
Where? Hakone?

282
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,734
No. Suzuran Hot Springs.

283
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,770
Good idea!

284
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,539
Hey.

285
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,680
That hits the spot!

286
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,615
"Hits the spot"?

287
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,916
You're like a grandma.

288
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,888
You want to say it too, Mom.
So just say it.

289
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,760
That hits the spot!

290
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,596
It feels nicer when you say that.

291
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,836
I feel like

292
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,871
I've finished an important job.

293
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,677
Bringing you and Fuga to that grave,

294
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,781
I think that was a major duty
that I was given.

295
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,986
I see.

296
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,588
Work is

297
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,157
a big duty one must do in life.

298
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,795
I see. I guess life has its duties.

299
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,199
Things we have to do…

300
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,776
Hello!

301
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,178
Should we get out soon?

302
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,446
You two beauties!

303
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,516
Yes!

304
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,718
We're about to get overheated.

305
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,721
Hey, you!

306
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,590
I wanted to try this once.

307
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,992
Conversing between the men's
and women's baths.

308
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,498
Alright.

309
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,034
Let's say, "cheers!"

310
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,103
Cheers!

311
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,377
LEMON PAGE, AOI MINASE'S NEW WORK,
<i>MIDSUMMER SKIES ARE DREAMS</i>

312
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,481
It's good!

313
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,951
Minase Sensei's new work,
<i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams.</i>

314
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,520
The illustration is nice too!

315
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:38,323
It's refreshing. Like a new wind
is blowing.

316
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,859
I'm happy with it too.

317
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,531
Now, we can relax a bit about Aoi Minase.

318
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,500
Looks like a lot's going on
in her family life, though.

319
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,402
But maybe that was all good inspiration.

320
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,973
And did you inspire her?

321
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,111
I didn't quite get there.

322
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,848
It's fine. You've done well.

323
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,184
Now, you can go to New York.

324
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,420
-What?
-It's a great honor.

325
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,824
You'll be transferred to
Saneisha New York.

326
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,527
Go sell some manga in New York, alright?

327
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,263
An international copyrighting business.

328
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,267
Well, that's just a front.

329
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,436
Mr. Yuzuru Yube

330
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,938
lives in New York right now.

331
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,874
<i>Soseki took the blame for</i>
<i>Mr. Yuzuru Yube's</i>

332
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,943
<i>plagiarism incident,</i>

333
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,544
<i>got transferred from manga,</i>

334
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,079
<i>and became Mom's editor.</i>

335
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,747
Mr. Yube

336
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,050
would only accept you.

337
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,651
He wants you to be his editor.

338
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,686
But…

339
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,620
NEW BOOKS 4.7 MILLION COPIES

00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,521
Listen.

341
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,723
Mr. Yube's <i>Isekai Wonder</i> is

342
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,825
a big hit right now.

343
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,129
It might even surpass <i>Jump.</i>

344
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,598
That's what <i>Shonen Up</i> editors are saying.

345
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,733
I'm going back to the Manga Department?

346
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,602
I don't want you to go either.

347
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,669
Trust me.

348
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,439
Because you're cute.

349
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,407
That's a little gross.

350
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,343
Think rationally.

351
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,445
Saneisha's main business

352
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,680
is manga and anime.

353
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,250
And their best magazine

354
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,685
asked me for you.

355
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,154
So I have to.

356
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,358
Do your best, alright?

357
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,860
For our company.

358
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,199
I talked to Ichinose about you in Okinawa.

359
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,834
About me?

360
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,402
Yeah. Ichinose

361
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,505
wanted to know what kind of mom you are.

362
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,673
Yes.

363
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,642
I heard many funny stories.

364
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,046
Like Sora's middle school
graduation ceremony.

365
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,383
All the students were holding back tears,

366
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,785
and just when someone was about to cry,

367
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,088
they heard a loud sobbing from the back.

368
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,958
Right. You cried first, Mom.

369
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,394
Because of that, no one could cry!

370
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,196
I felt really bad about that.

371
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,132
Oh! I have another story!

372
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,068
Sora! You drank too much!

373
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,037
I can drink more.

374
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,505
Do you want to have more

375
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,174
at my room on the second floor
of Obayashi?

376
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,978
I want to buy the drink we bought
at Okinawa! The shikuwasa sake.

377
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,148
Oh. That's still in the car.

378
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,050
Let's go grab it!

379
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,955
You're really drunk, you know?

380
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,557
I've always wanted to try something
as a kid.

381
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,694
Mom on the left, Dad on the right.

382
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,329
We hold hands,

383
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,830
and you lift me up!

384
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,466
Want to try now?

385
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,801
What? Right now?

386
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,569
I'm already grown!

387
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,770
Let's try it!

388
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,610
Let's go!

389
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,781
Mom, you have to hold my hand harder!

390
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,950
One, two.

391
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,486
We did it!

392
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,756
We did it.

393
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,993
All three of them together?

394
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,763
Yeah. They looked like a real family.

395
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
Well, they are family.

396
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,536
So that's Fuga Ichinose, huh?

397
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,908
It should be in that wooden box.

398
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:17,876
This one?

399
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,783
Are these photos from Okinawa?

400
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,354
-Photos of the sky?
-Yes.

401
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,858
-"Sora"? Of you?
-No.

402
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:33,859
The sky.

403
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,560
The blue sky.

404
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,034
You take a photo of the sky every day?

405
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:43,935
Well…

406
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,570
Yes.

407
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,476
Huh?

408
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,512
This is the photo you took of me.

409
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,788
I'm bad at this!

410
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,695
It stopped on March 14th.

411
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,403
OBAYASHI TOYS

412
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,639
Why did you stop taking photos of the sky

413
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,606
after taking

414
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,608
a picture of me?

415
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,415
Because you didn't need to?

416
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,721
Because you met the real Sora?

417
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,391
Did you know about Sora?

418
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,527
Is that why you took those photos?

419
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,130
Every day,

420
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,799
so you didn't forget about her.

421
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,070
It wasn't so that I don't forget.

422
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,041
How could I forget?

423
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,313
About me?

424
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,616
Because my name means sky?

425
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,318
Could it be

426
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,919
that the whole bag was filled with

427
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,054
pictures of the sky?

428
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,357
No way. That's gross and creepy.

429
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,327
Sorry, Dad.

430
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,201
Wait, no. I take that back.

431
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,170
No way, Anguidae!

432
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,039
Otterly weird, get otter here!
No way, no way, Nile crocodile!

433
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,841
Hell, hell, snail shell!

434
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,577
-What are you saying?
-I have an appointment!

435
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,479
I'll be going now!

436
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,520
SUPER SPICY TANTANMEN

437
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,221
Alright!

438
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,093
SORA MINASE

439
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,162
Who is it?

440
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,100
-Hello?
-I…

441
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,868
I called him "Dad!"

442
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,336
I called Dad "Dad."

443
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,405
At least say hello.

444
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,507
You would've seen my name on the screen!

445
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,277
I don't just live for you, you know.

446
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:09,214
I'm not some innocent girl waiting
by my phone all day

447
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,649
waiting for you to call!

448
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,084
Enough about that!

449
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,720
I called him Dad!

450
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,422
Who?

451
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,257
<i>Fuga Ichinose!</i>

452
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,727
He was taking photos of the sky.

453
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,831
The sky, not of me.

454
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,467
He took them every day
all the years before meeting me.

455
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,135
That's very moving.

456
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,136
No.

457
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,805
But it felt a bit like

458
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,807
he was a stalker.

459
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,711
Without thinking,
I called him gross and creepy.

460
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,879
That's so mean!

461
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,380
And then, I said,

462
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,082
"Sorry, Dad!"

463
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,319
What's going on with my head?

464
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,189
That sounds plausible.

465
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,725
Maybe deep, deep down in your heart,

466
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,227
you were moved,

467
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,162
and wanted to call him Dad.

468
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,097
<i>-Wrong!</i>
-I'm wrong?

469
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,833
Generally, you may be right,

470
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,035
but I think you're a little off.

471
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,838
If I'm generally right,
then let me have this one!

472
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,840
If I'm only a little off, it's fine!

473
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,442
Hey, I'm about to have the

474
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,644
Super Spicy Tantanmen from Hell.

475
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,280
So I'm hanging up in one minute.

476
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,382
Instant noodles take
2 minutes, 47 seconds, right?

477
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,917
Right.

478
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,821
There's no compromising instant ramen
cooking times.

479
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,756
Please eat your

480
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,625
Super Spicy Tantanmen from Hell.

481
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,728
Right. But I have 50 more seconds.

482
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,464
Prepare some chopsticks and water.

483
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,232
<i>Huh?</i>

484
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,068
<i>Huh? Huh? Huh?</i>

485
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,173
But Ichinose didn't know about you,

486
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,909
right, Sora?

487
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:44,943
What?

488
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,878
<i>About your existence.</i>

489
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,816
Oh! You're right.

490
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,120
He didn't know that

491
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,455
Suzu, my birth mother,

492
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,024
was pregnant

493
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,192
and had me.

494
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,029
Then why did he take photos of the sky?

495
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,330
The sky above.

496
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,998
I know.

497
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,899
<i>It's weird, right?</i>

498
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,735
Doesn't that mean
he knew that you existed?

499
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,704
He knew your name too.

500
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,875
What does that mean?

501
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,178
So you knew about Sora?

502
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,416
Did you take photos

503
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,619
of the sky every day,
since the day she was born?

504
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:31,923
Yes.

505
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:33,925
But

506
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,627
how did you know about Sora?

507
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,532
I received a letter from Suzu.

508
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,900
Twenty years ago.

509
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,937
After she had Sora.

510
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,076
To be more exact,
it was a reply to my letter.

511
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,545
<i>I sent her a letter</i>

512
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,314
<i>asking if we could get back together.</i>

513
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,451
<i>Her response was no.</i>

514
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,920
<i>She wouldn't be getting back with me.</i>

515
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,423
<i>But, that she gave birth to a baby girl.</i>

516
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:06,891
<i>She is your child.</i>

517
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,528
<i>Her name is Sora, meaning sky.</i>

518
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,798
She'll be with someone else.

519
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,635
That's what the letter said.

520
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,903
Someone else?

521
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,239
"I have someone I love.

522
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,742
I'll start a new family with this person."

523
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,144
The letter said,

524
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,546
"This person accepted

525
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,281
me and Sora."

526
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,686
There was no one like that.

527
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,791
That's why I believed

528
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,762
Suzu started a new family.

529
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:45,964
That's why

530
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,667
I was surprised when you came to me

531
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,335
with Sora.

532
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,872
Why would she lie?

533
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,609
Maybe to avoid a scandal?

534
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,344
Because you had just

535
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,713
landed a big role.

536
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,415
So maybe to protect you?

537
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:06,985
That means

538
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,654
you've been taking a photo
of the sky every day

539
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,289
since you received

540
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,759
the letter from Suzu?

541
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,731
It's creepy, huh?

542
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,101
But she…

543
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,871
She called you Dad.

544
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,143
A letter?

545
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,212
A letter from Mother Suzu?

546
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,351
What did you think about
on hearing that, Mom?

547
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,321
What do you mean?

548
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,023
How did you feel?

549
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,529
I just learned that

550
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,931
they had exchanged letters

551
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,867
without me knowing.

552
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,569
That's all.

553
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,240
I guess I'm a little sad.

554
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,510
But maybe Suzu

555
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,012
didn't want to tell me.

556
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:21,993
She probably thought

557
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,662
if she told you, you would go away.

558
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,264
What? Why?

559
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,866
Because he didn't write

560
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,068
a letter to you.

561
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,169
But he wrote to Suzu.

562
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,339
It means he loved Suzu more.

563
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,441
You hit me right where it hurts!

564
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,709
Sorry.

565
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,746
But maybe if she told you, you could've

566
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:42,947
gotten mad

567
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,415
or jealous,

568
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,718
and felt bad

569
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,486
and have gone away.

570
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,456
You might have told her to go and

571
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,557
be with Ichinose.

572
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,026
I probably would've said that.

573
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,262
I don't know about

574
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,130
jealousy or anger,

575
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,568
but I would've thought it's better
to be raised by your real mom and dad.

576
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,970
But Suzu didn't think so.

577
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,606
Rather than being raised by

578
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,975
the mysterious Ichinose with many women,

579
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,745
she thought it was better
if I was raised by you.

580
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,780
If she ever died.

581
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,927
She trusted me like that,

582
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:34,199
but was I able to raise you properly?

583
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,839
I'll prove it.

584
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,441
I'm a pretty good kid, aren't I?

585
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,528
Long time no see.

586
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,732
It's been a while.

587
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,001
What is it?

588
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,337
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

589
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,239
Look, I have legs.

590
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,244
Why did you

591
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,446
lie to me?

592
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,414
Hey.

593
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,583
That's the first thing you say to me?

594
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,822
I'm sorry.

595
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,691
I'm really…

596
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,426
sorry.

597
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,795
I lied?

598
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,665
Oh, about that?

599
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,335
I should be allowed to say
I have a new man, don't you think?

600
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,773
You really mistreated me, you know?

601
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,711
I told you I had Sora
because I wanted to be a good mom.

602
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,749
It was the pride of a woman.

603
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,585
"I left your child

604
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,022
in this world before I went."
It was my statement.

605
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,158
Why didn't you get back with me then?

606
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,296
Because I couldn't trust you.

607
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,332
But

608
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm glad you're doing well.

609
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,205
You too, Suzu.

610
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,841
Hey.

611
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,611
I can't reach down from

612
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,479
up above the clouds very well.

613
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,882
Take care of stuff

614
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,750
in this world, alright?

615
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,322
Promise me.

616
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:44,896
ODAYA

617
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,164
What I'm saying is,

618
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,400
because Mom is too giving

619
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:51,936
and kind,

620
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,872
I'm worried that…

621
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,875
What is it?

622
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,679
Maybe Mom

623
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,847
gave up on marriage

624
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,017
for my sake.

625
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,353
Maybe she gave up on having

626
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,620
her own kids for me.

627
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:13,091
You don't get it, do you?
She's not the type!

628
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,492
Actually,

629
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,728
could she think like that?

630
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,563
Hey,

631
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,333
you left for France
a year after Sora was born.

632
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,303
I was observing Aoi from here

633
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,271
for all these years.

634
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,741
So let me say this.

635
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,343
Sora.

636
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,444
I'd say,

637
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,715
your concerns are groundless.

638
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,150
You're worried over nothing.

639
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,853
Aoi, with her beauty,

640
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,755
was always popular with boys.

641
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,323
And Sora, you were so cute too.

642
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,291
Aoi would tell them,

643
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,960
"If you marry me,

644
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,529
you get to be with
this very cute girl too!

645
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,165
It's like getting both

646
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,668
a diamond and an emerald!

647
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,537
Aren't you so lucky?"

648
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,005
She said that all the time.

649
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:02,840
She's strong!

650
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,910
Whether they were doctors or bureaucrats,

651
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,612
all the men

652
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,313
were after her.

653
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,384
Stories like that about Aoi
always piss me off!

654
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,054
Gon-chan, are we talking about that now?

655
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,288
We're talking about me.

656
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,524
Sorry.

657
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,393
There's nothing for you to be
concerned about, Sora.

658
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,961
Aoi just felt

659
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,397
more at home
staying with just the two of you,

660
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,266
Sora.

661
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,068
That's why she didn't marry.

662
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,070
That's all.

663
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,738
Can I ask you something else?

664
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,873
Hey, ask me something too.

665
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,276
One question remains.

666
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,012
Why did Mother Suzu,

667
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,081
Suzu, who passed away,

668
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,482
let Fuga Ichinose know

669
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,984
that I existed, in her letter?

670
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,253
If she didn't want to

671
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,456
be in the way of an up and coming star,

672
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,724
she should have kept quiet about me.

673
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,097
I think that Suzu, before she died,
wanted to leave you with

674
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,532
another person to depend on

675
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,502
in case something happened to Aoi.

676
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,940
It's much easier on children if they have

677
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,075
two parents instead of just one.

678
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,744
It's better to have more people
to protect you.

679
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,780
That's why I think

680
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,582
she told Fuga Ichinose

681
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,618
that he had a daughter.

682
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,321
That's my opinion.

683
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,857
He might be

684
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,026
some kind of help to you in the future
when you need him.

685
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,697
Please…

686
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,432
don't tell

687
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,267
Mom about that, okay?

688
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,969
Sora.

689
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,405
I'm sure Aoi knows.

690
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,080
We've received great feedback
for <i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams.</i>

691
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,581
The reader survey is good too.

692
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,318
Sure, the survey is fine.

693
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,888
Huh? What's wrong?

694
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,789
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

695
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,992
Your tone is gloomy.

696
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,693
It's very obvious.

697
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,096
Hold on. Could it be…?

698
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,498
I checked online.

699
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,034
<i>I told you not to do that!</i>

700
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,036
Stop Googling yourself!

701
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,671
You know, the thing is,

702
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,107
even after reading 100 good comments,

703
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,643
if I find one criticism,
that's all I think about!

704
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,711
What did it say?

705
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,347
That I'm behind the times.

706
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:24,982
Ms. Aoi.

707
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,685
At one time,

708
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,453
you released several

709
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,190
explosive hit books that sold over
a million copies.

710
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,159
Like <i>The Scent of the Sky</i>

711
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,427
and <i>The Tears About to Fall.</i>

712
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,629
That's true.

713
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,530
<i>Ms. Aoi.</i>

714
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,833
Only writers who survive

715
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,770
for an era and leave
a strong impression on the public

716
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,705
get to be "behind the times."

717
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,176
The only way you can tell if an author
is truly behind the times

718
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,780
is if she's able to continue writing
fresh work right now.

719
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,381
That's what I believe.

720
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,786
<i>Ms. Aoi, you haven't retired,</i>

721
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,321
<i>and you still feel strongly.</i>

722
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,989
And, you've got energy.

723
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,259
Watching you like that,

724
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,495
I start thinking that the times will
end up

725
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,631
being behind you.

726
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,636
I'm so glad you're my editor, Soseki.

727
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,273
-About that…
<i>-Sorry!</i>

728
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,810
A three-star restaurant just
opened a bakery in Suzuran District.

729
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:29,714
They serve fresh-baked cream bread
at five o'clock!

730
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,616
So, I gotta go!

731
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,955
Bread comes before me, huh?

732
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,092
<i>UMBILICAL CORD,</i> AOI MINASE

733
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,493
I see.

734
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,229
You went with Ichinose and your mother

735
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,632
to visit your birth mother's grave?

736
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,335
I'm glad we did it.

737
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,241
Hey.

738
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,944
I asked Ichinose

739
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,613
to do the Taiyou-Do interiors

740
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:04,749
on purpose.

741
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,985
So that Ichinose could

742
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,553
stay in Suzuran.

743
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:11,822
Why?

744
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,624
So that he could spend

745
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,160
more time with you.

746
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,231
I lost my parents

747
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,634
when I was young

748
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,836
and I had many regrets.

749
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,774
I've always wished I could
talk to them more.

750
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,210
So I thought

751
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,882
you would think the same thing
if Ichinose left.

752
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,384
You got a great opportunity.

753
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,287
So I wanted to give you more time
to be together.

754
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,857
Doctor Wataru…

755
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,561
Mana, you don't have a Switch!

756
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,462
Yeah.

757
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,731
You can't play if you don't have a Switch.

758
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,766
-You can't join us!
-Bye!

759
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,827
<i>The Fourth World from the Right.</i>

760
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,296
-For the title?
-Yeah.

761
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,166
It means the world I live in

762
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,102
is just one out of

763
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,036
many worlds.

764
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,541
It doesn't feel very Jump.

765
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,010
-That's true.
-Yeah.

766
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,346
-I got it. I'll think about it more.
-Okay.

767
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,615
Hey.

768
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,183
About this panel…

769
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,454
Your drawing sucks.
I have no idea what this is!

770
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,123
Sorry.

771
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,526
Hey, don't apologize!

772
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,529
Otherwise, I'm just a mean girl.

773
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,297
You're right.

774
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,633
Hey, to change the subject,

775
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,034
are you hungry?

776
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,137
-I am!
-Alright.

777
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,842
Ichinose!

778
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,844
Your timer was beeping so I turned it off.

779
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,446
Oh, thank you.

780
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,049
I was making <i>rafute</i>

781
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,317
with the <i>awamori.</i>

782
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,187
We were making Okinawa food together.

783
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,656
-Join us, Aoi.
-But I have this.

784
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,126
Oh, that's the popular bakery!

785
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,495
Next to Café Tomoshibi, right?

786
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,863
-Exactly!
-Wow!

787
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,731
Save that

788
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,500
for tomorrow's breakfast.

789
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,802
Did you hear that, Aoi? So come over!

790
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,644
So delicious!

791
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,413
I'm glad.

792
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,516
You were always a good cook.

793
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,953
You could only boil water.

794
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,056
How did you date a girl like me?

795
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,258
Even though I thought you forgot about me.

796
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,260
No.

797
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,629
You were like

798
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,731
a sunflower.

799
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,567
A sunflower in the summer.

800
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,972
I was always

801
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,673
a heavy and gloomy person.

802
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,176
I was the type to do
underground theater in Shimokita.

803
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:58,182
If I was an unpopular literary magazine
with a thick letterpress,

804
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,918
the one week I spent with you

805
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,288
is the color-print page of my life.

806
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,024
A color-printed pinup girl?

807
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,158
Exactly.

808
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,530
But you'd get tired if the whole book
was printed in color.

809
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:13,797
You can't relax.

810
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,403
Want to play Jenga?

811
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,205
Great idea!

812
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,340
What should we bet on?

813
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,978
Let me think.

814
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,620
<i>The Scent</i>

815
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,722
<i>of the Sky.</i>

816
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,532
<i>We Can Meet Again.</i>

817
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,601
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

818
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:53,938
What is it?

819
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,115
<i>An Off-Handed Goodbye.</i>

820
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,720
<i>Crybaby</i>

821
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,155
<i>Evening.</i>

822
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,261
I read

823
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,430
all of your books.

824
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,765
They were all beautiful.

825
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,472
I fell in love

826
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,076
with many people after that.

827
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,780
After we broke up.

828
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,386
But

829
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,556
I couldn't truly love anyone else.

830
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,961
On stage

831
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,730
you were so beautiful,

832
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,299
and off the stage

833
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,835
you were very loveable.

834
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,571
Now,

835
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,673
I'm just some driftwood seller.

836
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,277
But you haven't changed.

837
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,781
You're the only you

838
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,017
in this whole entire world.

839
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,325
I'll take the smaller one.

840
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,826
-Really?
-Yeah.

841
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,465
So good!

842
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,802
Hey.

843
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,037
-Drink it!
-I can't.

844
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,639
How nice!

845
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,974
You're doing it

846
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,876
later tonight, right?

847
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,378
Stop it!

848
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,015
Hey, she's pretty cute!

849
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,717
Let me touch you!

850
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,352
-Don't touch her!
-What the hell?

851
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,154
Hey, stop! Stop!

852
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,088
Shut up!

853
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,393
Hey!

854
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,695
-Hey!
-Stop it!

855
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,096
What are you guys doing!

856
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,331
I'll call the police.

857
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,533
Shit.

858
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,101
This is bad.

859
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,837
You okay?

860
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,706
-Are you alright?
-Yes.

861
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,475
They're just some brats that are
always loitering around here.

862
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,011
Go home!

863
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,048
This area isn't safe.

864
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,484
It's not like where you live.

865
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,387
My glasses.

866
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,223
Where are my glasses?

867
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,233
They're cracked. The frames too.

868
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,737
I'm really nearsighted.

869
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,538
I can't see without them.

870
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,110
I'll put these away. Do you have spares?

871
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,279
I have a spare pair at home.

872
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,483
I'll head home for now.

873
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,588
I'll walk you home.

874
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,494
So you don't fall.

875
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,230
Okay.

876
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,072
Hey.

877
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,740
What is it?

878
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,542
I thought only

879
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,446
boyfriends and girlfriends held hands.

880
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,752
It's because it's an emergency.

881
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,221
Your glasses are broken.

882
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:33,690
I see.

883
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,367
Hey, it's red.

884
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,401
I can see that.

885
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,303
It's just blurry.

886
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,541
You don't wear contacts?

887
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,543
I'm scared to put them in my eyes.

888
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,578
That's true.

889
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,960
It's snowing!

890
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:14,932
It's beautiful.

891
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,702
I wonder if Sora's seeing
this snow right now.

892
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,574
Aoi.

893
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,179
What if we…

894
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,250
got together again?

895
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,652
What?

896
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,455
Or rather,

897
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,291
start together again?

898
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,399
What are you doing?

899
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,202
<i>The Scent of the Snow.</i>

900
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,339
Oh, your mom's novel!

901
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,242
<i>The Scent of the Sky.</i>

902
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,714
It does smell like snow!

903
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,550
What kind of smell is it?

904
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,119
Doesn't it smell like mints?

905
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,222
It stings.

906
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,425
It's green. We can cross.

907
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,629
Even though no one's here.

908
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,899
One day…

909
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,004
One day, in the future.

910
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,708
We're sophomores in college now.

911
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,545
We'll become juniors in April.

912
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,448
We'll start looking for jobs.

913
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,450
And we won't draw manga.

914
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,620
Don't talk about that when we're about to

915
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,821
submit to Jump!

916
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,390
I know.

917
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,358
That's why

918
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:50,961
this is all theoretical.

919
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,232
A story about
the third world from the right.

920
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,874
Then, we'll graduate college,

921
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,777
we'll become adults,

922
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,379
and start working.

923
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,716
We won't draw manga,

924
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,651
and when something happens,

925
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,854
I won't call you
and ask you to help me.

926
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,657
That will all

927
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,359
go away.

928
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,062
That's not true.

929
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,196
Nothing will change.

930
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,432
It will change!

931
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,170
Not everything

932
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,306
will change.

933
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,654
What is it?

934
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,028
The Scent of Hikaru.

935
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,797
What the hell is that?

936
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,801
Do I stink? Am I okay?

937
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,438
You smell like grass.

938
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,641
Like my childhood.

939
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,213
How romantic!

940
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,849
I'll remember

941
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,351
this smell, always.

942
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,197
<i>One day,</i>

943
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,500
<i>I'll remember this day,</i>

944
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,468
<i>I'll remember this moment,</i>

945
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,304
<i>and think back on it longingly.</i>

946
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,740
<i>That's what I think now.</i>

947
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,411
<i>Even after</i>

948
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,179
<i>the light turned green,</i>

949
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,348
<i>we couldn't start walking.</i>

950
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,118
THE FINAL EPISODE

951
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,487
-Won't you go to New York with me?
-What?

952
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,456
I just cast a spell on you.

953
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,557
<i>All the men want Mom!</i>

954
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,858
<i>She might go away.</i>

955
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,794
<i>Even if your mom goes to</i>
<i>Okinawa, I'm right here.</i>

956
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,896
<i>Get out! Get out of this town!</i>

957
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,964
<i>I'll decide where to go myself!</i>

958
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:08,965
