1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:02,769
Ms. Aoi.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,441
What if we….

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,479
got together again?

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,247
What?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,183
<i>DON'T FORGET ME</i> BY AOI MINASE
FILM ADAPTATION!

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,918
Wow, this is

7
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,187
so great. Wonderful!

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,089
Si-Kni's Yuto will play the lead…

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,392
-Si-Kni?
-Silent Knife!

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,128
When we announced that Yuto
will play the lead

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,296
for the film adaptation of
<i>Don't Forget Me,</i>

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,666
DFM, or <i>Don't Forget Me,</i>

13
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,902
got 300,000 reprints!

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,238
Your past works

15
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,841
are also selling because of this.
Reprint after reprint!

16
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,244
<i>Midsummer Skies are Dreams</i>
is doing extremely well.

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,146
A good wind is blowing our way!

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,647
Let's ride this out!

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,183
Let's ride! It'll be a breeze!

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,120
Yes, thanks to you,
I'm getting more new jobs.

21
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,088
Hey, Mom. You got

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,890
an offer for a Unishiro commercial.

23
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,425
Oh, I see.

24
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,560
You're happy, even though
you don't wear them?

25
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,162
How did you know that?

26
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,631
It's obvious from your expression.

27
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,000
A bunch of people will
appear in the footage.

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,234
You're one of many.

29
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,670
-Oh, then please say no.
-Ryo.

30
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,038
What is "Ryo"?

31
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,841
Konishi, you're so old!
It's short for <i>"ryokai,"</i> or roger!

32
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,843
I'm joking. I know that.

33
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,546
Right now, even "Ri" is old.

34
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,949
You're declining the Unishiro offer?
What a waste!

35
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,052
Maybe I can go on instead.

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,855
I'd appear solo.

37
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,724
As expected from Aoi Minase!

38
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,927
You'll only appear
in a Unishiro commercial solo.

39
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,863
I don't hate that big ego
of yours, you know.

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,764
What's with you?

41
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,867
I'm saying that the only one
who could be Aoi Minase's editor

42
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,269
other than Soseki, is me.

43
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,304
I see.

44
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,607
Soseki will be transferring
this coming April.

45
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,675
To Saneisha New York.

46
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,945
-What?
-Mr. Konishi.

47
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,447
Why did you tell them?
I wanted to tell them myself!

48
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,418
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,553
I tried to tell you many times
over the phone.

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,289
I know! You requested the transfer
because you didn't

51
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,958
want to deal with me!

52
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,061
How did you come to
such a pessimistic conclusion?

53
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,729
I mean, it's hard to deal with me.

54
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,197
So, you do know.

55
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,468
No, that was a joke.

56
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,536
No!

57
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,273
You're so carefree,

58
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,343
but you become a little girl sometimes.

59
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,812
I was always afraid

60
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,648
of being by myself when
walking to the science room,

61
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,116
or eating lunch.

62
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,453
That's why I acted bubbly and friendly!

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,088
And now, we're here.

64
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,925
I was asked by

65
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,460
Fuga Ichinose

66
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,762
if I would go with him to Okinawa.

67
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,297
If we could get back together.

68
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,003
He found a long-term driftwood job
in Okinawa.

69
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,372
Doing interiors for a luxury hotel.

70
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,073
He's going to be

71
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,376
working on the hotel's interiors
for three years.

72
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,213
He said we'd find a house to
live in very cheaply.

73
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,682
Are you going?

74
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,621
I'm still thinking.

75
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,857
What if you

76
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,960
go to New York with me instead?

77
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,763
What?

78
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,168
<i>Isn't the moon a little plump today?</i>

79
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,470
<i>Maybe it should go on a diet!</i>

80
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,838
Sora! You here?

81
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,374
You're too loud.
Can't you see that I'm here?

82
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,143
Listen.

83
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,312
I'm so popular with the men right now!

84
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,447
Where's Gon-chan?

85
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,216
He's at Suzuran Hot Springs,

86
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,151
then he's going to a dinner party.

87
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,186
So you're popular right now?

88
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,955
Let's have some beer to celebrate!

89
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,690
Yes, let's!

90
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,360
-That's good!
-Shunichiro.

91
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,629
I've been wanting to say this to you
for a long time.

92
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,697
What is it?

93
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,266
The way you wear a hoodie under
the kimono is so cool!

94
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,134
Oh, not at all.

95
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,369
You're the only one in

96
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,870
the world who can pull that off!

97
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,540
The world, huh? That's a big statement!

98
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,243
So what is this about you
being popular with the men?

99
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,045
Sora, you listen too.

100
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,514
Another bragging story from you?

101
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,350
No. Before, I was bragging about

102
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,884
how popular I was in the past.

103
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,120
But now, I'm popular in the present!

104
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,057
I got proposed to!

105
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,492
By Fuga Ichinose and Soseki.

106
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,196
I wish it happened during separate times!

107
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,865
I wish it was separate.
I don't want it all at once.

108
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,468
But my choices aren't that great.

109
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,436
An ex, and Soseki, who's just nearby.

110
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,472
Mom, be nice!

111
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,307
You should be grateful.

112
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,509
That's true. I am grateful.

113
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,444
So, Sora.

114
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,315
Fuga found a house for us in Okinawa.
This one.

115
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,053
And if we go to New York with Soseki,

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,055
you can study abroad.

117
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,058
There are a lot of colleges
that work with Rissei Gakuin.

118
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,294
What are you saying, Mom?

119
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,865
I won't be going. I have school.

120
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,733
So you can study abroad.

121
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,168
I won't do that.

122
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,038
Oh, right. I see.

123
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,139
Because of Hikaru?

124
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,874
Why is that relevant?

125
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,776
I take that back!

126
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,077
That was toxic of me.

127
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
Eventually, children will
leave their parents.

128
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,213
That's true.

129
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,449
But Gon-chan and Shunichiro live together.

130
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,784
That's possible too.

131
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,252
Mom might need care one day.

132
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,586
It's too early for that.

133
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,989
I won't be a burden to you.

134
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,291
That's why I bought that house.

135
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,626
Eventually, I'll sell it

136
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,928
and get into a luxury senior home.

137
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,597
What? You're not giving me that house?

138
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,334
You earn your own living, Sora!

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,936
You let me live that luxury lifestyle!

140
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,037
And now, this?

141
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,439
Calm down, you two.

142
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,940
Today, we have

143
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,308
bamboo shoots and rice!

144
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,410
I'd like some, please!

145
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,846
That was so refreshing!

146
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,248
I love that they have a sauna here.

147
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,384
I was wondering why you were
in such great shape.

148
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,852
Is it because of driftwood?

149
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,687
Yes, I pick it up

150
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,955
on the beach.

151
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,856
On the beach?

152
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,795
The one I left with you,

153
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,198
this is for

154
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,833
the chiropractor,

155
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,801
Taiyou-Do.

156
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,903
Do you lift the big ones too?

157
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,071
Sure do.

158
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,973
Some are three times my size.

159
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,443
How nice! You're so strong.

160
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,047
Around here, it's just skinny men
working in IT.

161
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,115
They're smart, right?

162
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,183
They have money, so they go to

163
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,651
an expensive gym and train

164
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,488
to be popular with young women!

165
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,457
But men should be about the sea,

166
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,659
and driftwood!

167
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,728
Each one is different.

168
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,165
These curves have their unique beauty.

169
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,834
I'm sure they'll look nice here.

170
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,137
Really? How nice.

171
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,439
Maybe I'll ask my husband.

172
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,345
Auntie.

173
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,448
Give me fruit milk too.

174
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,617
Make it a double.

175
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,018
What are you saying?

176
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,555
So whether it's Okinawa or New York,
I'd be leaving you, huh?

177
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,057
You have to pick one.

178
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,360
You can't go to both. That'd be bigamy.

179
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,728
Yeah.

180
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,863
Both sound fun.

181
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,933
With your job, you can work anywhere.

182
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,403
But I can't speak English.

183
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,441
But in Okinawa, they'd look at you funny
if you wore Saint Laurent.

184
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,211
They look at you funny
in Suzuran Shopping District too.

185
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,813
-Really?
-Yup.

186
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,314
I didn't notice at all.

187
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,749
Excuse me.

188
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,419
How long will you be here?

189
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,557
I'm going to Okinawa soon.

190
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:39,959
And you are?

191
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,929
I'm from Odaya.

192
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,097
I run the <i>taiyaki</i> shop right next door.

193
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,503
So you're Gon-chan.

194
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,841
Odaya's <i>taiyaki</i> is very popular.

195
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,344
I'm not good with sweets, you see.

196
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,546
But you're drinking fruit milk now.

197
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,849
You're supposed to have fruit milk
after a bath!

198
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,718
Is that so?

199
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
But you serve

200
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,590
different types of foods, right?

201
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,358
I heard from Kanae at Obayashi.

202
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,028
I'm not sure if we have anything
to your liking.

203
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,830
Just things like <i>yakisoba</i> and oden.

204
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,967
I love those!

205
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,803
When will you be leaving?

206
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,605
By next weekend.

207
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,640
Thank god!

208
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,576
What? Oh, no.

209
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,145
Don't you feel that way when you
look at this painting?

210
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,083
"Thank god!"

211
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,352
Anyways,

212
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,720
the moon and cheese.

213
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,155
Keynes is a romantic, right?

214
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,224
He's acting all cool,

215
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,660
but he looks like this.

216
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,131
The last report of the year
is due next class!

217
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,766
What?

218
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,902
It's already goodbye, huh?

219
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,739
-Minase!
-What?

220
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,640
Did you take notes?

221
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,409
I was focused on our manga name.

222
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,011
I forgot to take notes.

223
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,146
That's what I thought,

224
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,614
so I took very detailed notes!

225
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,922
The Scent of Hikaru.

226
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,127
I'll copy this and give it back.

227
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,235
Recently,

228
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,105
Mom's been popular with the guys.

229
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,475
Your mom is pretty, after all.

230
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,543
And she's young.

231
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,612
She got proposed to.

232
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,347
What? That's fast!

233
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,250
She might go away.

234
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,055
I'll be glad to be alone.

235
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,428
-Hello.
-Welcome!

236
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,067
Oh, I can step out.

237
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,604
We were just about to go out.

238
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,973
Sally, I got transferred to

239
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,975
Saneisha New York.

240
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,911
I see.

241
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,379
Be well.

242
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,682
Sorry about the other day.

243
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,184
Sally.

244
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,752
Be happy, alright?

245
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,587
You too.

246
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,789
It's nothing.

247
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,059
We'll be going, then.

248
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,835
You're going to New York?

249
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,037
Yes. That's why

250
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,440
I wanted oden from here before I left.

251
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,744
I'm sorry, Shunichiro.

252
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,612
About what?

253
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,050
I don't have any feelings
for Soseki anymore.

254
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,785
I see.

255
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,888
Do you doubt me?

256
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,456
Nope.

257
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,526
If that's what you say,
then it must be true.

258
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,161
I trust you.

259
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:05,931
You're so kind.

260
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,634
To be completely honest,

261
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,936
it can't be helped that

262
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,806
you don't get over the person
you used to love completely.

263
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,641
We're all human.

264
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,577
It's strange to be able to
cut them off completely.

265
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,450
You can bring

266
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,752
all that with you.

267
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,822
Shunichiro.

268
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,892
You know?

269
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,428
As long as you're laughing,

270
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,962
and not crying,

271
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,863
and

272
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,866
if you're happy, that's all I care about.

273
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,505
That's my greatest wish.

274
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,380
-I found it.
-What?

275
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,050
My happiness.

276
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,854
I found you!

277
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,662
-Good evening.
-Welcome!

278
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,131
Oh.

279
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,700
We met at the bath, didn't we?

280
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,079
What'll it be?

281
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,114
Right.

282
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,082
-I'll have a beer first.
-Coming up!

283
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,691
It's done.

284
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,794
OKINAWA WITH FUGA, NY WITH SOSEKI

285
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,970
DRINK

286
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,340
Roger that!

287
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,918
What if we…

288
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,122
got back together?

289
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,827
Do I really have to decide?

290
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,596
I wish I could

291
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,966
stay in this moment forever.

292
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,538
Why does life keep moving forward?

293
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,507
Why can't we go back?

294
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,245
I'd love to stay
in this present moment forever.

295
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,584
I want to stay in this moment forever.

296
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,452
What if you…

297
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,556
came to New York with me instead?

298
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,497
What if he was just teasing me?

299
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,239
Who is it?

300
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,110
Please give this to her.

301
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,812
Sorry, Sora's not here right now.

302
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,014
She's seeing Doctor Wataru today,
then working at Odaya.

303
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,717
It's fine. It's not like we had plans.
Just wanted to

304
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,552
return this ASAP.

305
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,921
What are you guys studying?

306
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,157
The moon and cheese?

307
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,993
Won't you come in? I can make tea.

308
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,028
Oh, it's alright!
I have to write a report.

309
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,263
Right. I see.

310
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,931
Thank you for this.

311
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,267
Um…

312
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,037
I heard you were leaving Tokyo.

313
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,773
You got proposed to?

314
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,810
What?

315
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,812
Oh no, Sora talks about that stuff?

316
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,813
Yes.

317
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,648
I hear you're popular with the guys now.

318
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,649
Right.

319
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,084
Once every four years.

320
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,152
Once in a blue moon. Like Halley's comet.

321
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,688
It all came crashing at once!

322
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,260
Sora looked lonely.

323
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:55,961
What?

324
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,830
Because you might be going somewhere.

325
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,699
Sora said she was lonely?

326
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,701
She didn't, but it's obvious.

327
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,003
You can see it in her face.

328
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,238
I see.

329
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,542
She doesn't show that to me.

330
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,913
She's someone

331
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,848
who can't say she's lonely.

332
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,850
What?

333
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,654
Because I always say it first.

334
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,994
And I'm not great at
picking up on people's emotions.

335
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,630
Sora

336
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,900
loves you a lot.

337
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,973
Here's your <i>yakisoba.</i>

338
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,942
This is delicious.

339
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,076
What is this?

340
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,412
It's just a <i>chikuwa.</i>

341
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,281
I see.

342
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,453
I'm sorry.

343
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,488
Truly.

344
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:57,823
It's fine.

345
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,993
I knew your heart wasn't
in it, and I pretended

346
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,795
not to notice.

347
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,197
Doctor…

348
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,333
Do you have

349
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,335
someone else you like?

350
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,303
What?

351
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,311
I don't know if I like them.

352
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,849
I don't really know anything about love.

353
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,085
I see.

354
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,189
There's no need to force a label

355
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,257
on your feelings or relationships.

356
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,592
What?

357
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,194
That's what I think.

358
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,896
Just let it be.

359
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,432
Let it be?

360
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,369
But

361
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,438
it's an important relationship, right?

362
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,440
And you don't want to lose it.

363
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,180
I don't want to

364
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,116
lose it.

365
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:00,919
Protect it, then.

366
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,256
Protect it?

367
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,393
Yeah. You have to protect

368
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,361
what you don't want to lose.

369
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,231
Doctor Wataru.

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,537
I'll never be called "Doctor Wataru"
with your cute voice again.

371
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,940
My voice isn't

372
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,942
that cute.

373
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,079
That was lame to say.

374
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,080
I'm sorry.

375
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,083
It's partially my fault

376
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,420
that I couldn't
create a relationship with you

377
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,822
that you didn't want to lose.

378
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,894
But even then,

379
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,996
I loved you a lot, Doctor Wataru.

380
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,634
Past tense…

381
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,504
I knew that,

382
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,873
and it made me feel happy.

383
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:56,775
I also

384
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,779
loved how direct
and honest you were, Sora.

385
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,050
I used the past tense too.

386
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,418
So we're even.

387
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,389
Good luck,

388
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,691
Sora.

389
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,028
Huh?

390
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,130
You may not be able to

391
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,201
meet someone like that ever again
in your life.

392
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,136
That relationship of yours.

393
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,942
Here's another.

394
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,544
-More hot sake for you.
-Thank you.

395
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:34,813
I heard Aoi

396
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,116
also comes here often.

397
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,784
What?

398
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,819
And Sora works here too, right?

399
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,789
Thank you

400
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,757
for taking care of them.

401
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,494
Why are you thanking me?

402
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,697
We've been close for many years.

403
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,365
I know that.

404
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,003
When are you going to Okinawa?

405
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,672
Maybe next week.

406
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,008
I see.

407
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,744
With Aoi too.

408
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:07,679
What?

409
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,649
I think Aoi will be joining me.

410
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,954
We had a little something in the past.

411
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,157
And now too.

412
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,225
Honestly, I don't hate it.

413
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,396
You know, old flames and all.

414
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,600
Aoi's not bad for her age too.

415
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,670
She's a pretty good woman.

416
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,539
It'd be a waste if she stayed single.

417
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,910
I was patient with you because
you're a customer! What are you saying?

418
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,080
Don't come crawling back
to a woman of your past!

419
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,482
Get out of this town!

420
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,484
Stop it, Gon!

421
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,954
-What's going on?
-Does that hurt?

422
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,223
Aoi was hurting

423
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,292
so much more!

424
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,726
Right here!

425
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,629
Abandoned by a man she loved.

426
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,331
And raising his woman's child!

427
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,700
-Stop! Don't listen!
-Please, Gon.

428
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,269
Don't you know how hard it is
to raise a child

429
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,938
all on your own?

430
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,574
What you did was evil! You're the devil!

431
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,608
You're not human!

432
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,543
Gon!

433
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,212
Don't go around

434
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,380
calling Aoi a good woman!

435
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,316
Don't look at her with those filthy eyes!

436
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,851
Are you jealous?

437
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,321
Stop it!

438
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,594
Don't you know how hard it was for Sora?

439
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,430
Learning Aoi wasn't her real mom!

440
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,099
It's all your fault!

441
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,603
What nerve you've got,
coming here like that. Get out.

442
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,937
Leave this town!

443
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,209
I'll do as I please.

444
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,713
Listen closely, bastard!

445
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,949
Calm down, Gon!

446
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,784
I won't give you

447
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,087
Aoi or Sora!

448
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,922
You abandoned them once.

449
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,890
How can they trust you?

450
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,159
They don't belong to you.

451
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,763
-Gon!
-Stop it, Gon-chan!

452
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,198
I'll protect them!

453
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,699
Aoi and Sora are

454
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,934
mine!

455
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,536
-Stop it, Gon-chan! He'll die!
-Let go!

456
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,472
-He'll die!
-Stop, Gon!

457
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,240
-He's laughing!
-Please…

458
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,046
He seems to be relieved

459
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,382
that you punched him.

460
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,326
Hey.

461
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,861
Who are you?

462
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,063
I'm nobody.

463
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,098
I just happened to pass by.

464
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,478
SANEISHA SOSEKI TACHIBANA

465
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,747
<i>I thought it would be better</i>
<i>if I told you.</i>

466
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,849
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

467
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,053
-I'll be alright.
<i>-That really happened?</i>

468
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,990
It might be better to let Sora
be on her own for a bit.

469
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,829
Is Ichinose alright?

470
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,199
Are you worried about him?

471
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,070
Well…

472
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,072
Sora's with him.

473
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,640
Ichinose's a grown man too.

474
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,976
That's right.

475
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,212
He's a grown man.

476
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,460
If I did this at Obayashi,

477
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,329
Kanae will worry.

478
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,166
Why were you laughing?

479
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,402
Even though you got beaten up.

480
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,938
I wasn't laughing.

481
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,675
I don't believe

482
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,010
that something like this will
relieve my sins,

483
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,381
but I felt relief at someone condemning me

484
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,816
for my wrongdoings.

485
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,954
I could've taken five more punches.

486
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,690
You'd have died.

487
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,860
Gon-chan used to be

488
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,995
a <i>Crows Zero</i> youth back in the day.

489
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,803
Do you wish

490
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,271
I had punched you?

491
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,142
I'm not sure about that.

492
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,311
You're a girl, after all.

493
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,723
Here.

494
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,360
It was in my pocket.

495
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,468
Should I put it on?

496
00:23:59,037 --> 00:23:59,871
No.

497
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:02,874
I'll do it.

498
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:11,950
Hey, Dad?

499
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,554
What kind of girl

500
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,757
did you think

501
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,193
I would be

502
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,862
as you took

503
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,664
pictures of the sky

504
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,567
every day?

505
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,008
Maybe you felt

506
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,945
disappointed that I was like this.

507
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,519
You grew up

508
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,255
inside my mind

509
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,225
slowly, over the years.

510
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,663
I wasn't told when your birthday was,

511
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,832
so I couldn't celebrate it.

512
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,435
But you grew up

513
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,637
year by year,

514
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,874
inside my mind.

515
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,544
I never imagined

516
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,113
I could ever meet you.

517
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,261
Should I put this on?

518
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,597
Your mouth's cut up.

519
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,400
No.

520
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,271
I'm not going to use this.
I'll keep this with me.

521
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,383
Alright, all finished!

522
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,486
Now, we just need a title.

523
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,288
Right.

524
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,523
Hey.

525
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,492
I actually have an idea for a title.

526
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,593
What is it?

527
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,695
But it's so embarrassing!

528
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,331
-Come on!
-Ask me what it is.

529
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,067
What is it, then?

530
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,774
<i>The World with You.</i>

531
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,044
Hear me out.

532
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,380
In a dilapidated world with no stories,

533
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,716
Emil and Jadwiga meet.

534
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,852
No matter how terrible the world becomes,

535
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,088
for Emil, it's the world
where Jadwiga exists.

536
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,557
As long as Jadwiga doesn't die.

537
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,694
That's the most important thing to Emil.

538
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,162
<i>The World with You.</i>

539
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,333
That's really good!

540
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,935
<i>The World with You</i> is a really cool title!

541
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,236
What? No way!

542
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,006
But it's not very <i>Jump,</i> don't you think?

543
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,443
Maybe <i>Jump</i> won't like it. But I like it.

544
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,178
Is that more important?

545
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,946
Because it's our manga.

546
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,316
Right. Alright!

547
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,018
It's decided then!

548
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,023
Now, we just have to draw the cover
and send it off to <i>Jump!</i>

549
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,358
I'm so nervous!

550
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,859
Same here!

551
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,962
I've provided Konishi with
all the necessary documents.

552
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,598
I think you're in great hands, Ms. Aoi.

553
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,368
Yes. Thank you.

554
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,470
I'll be going now.

555
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,106
Hey, wait a minute.

556
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,674
Today's your last day, right?

557
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,109
Yes, that's right.

558
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,145
-You're going to New York, right?
-Yes.

559
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,114
So…

560
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,182
What about your offer the other day?

561
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,584
What offer?

562
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,754
Are you playing dumb?

563
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,222
In that case…

564
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,258
why don't you go to New York with me?

565
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,560
Were you teasing me?

566
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,497
No.

567
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,632
I was serious.

568
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,701
But

569
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,404
I don't have to ask to know the answer.

570
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,307
You don't intend on coming with me
to New York, do you?

571
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,444
Wait a minute. I was…

572
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,780
I was thinking of what to say.
I'm a writer, after all.

573
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,747
But,

574
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,116
in conclusion, you won't be
coming with me, right?

575
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,290
Remember when I said,

576
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,092
"Let's put a lid on it for three months."

577
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,295
<i>Why don't we put a lid on it?</i>

578
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,198
It hasn't been three months yet.

579
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,467
And I haven't changed.

580
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,204
But for you,

581
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,672
a lot of things have happened.

582
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,077
I didn't want to burden you
with rejecting me.

583
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,647
And I didn't want our last time together
to be emotional.

584
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,450
This is our last time together?

585
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,984
Yes.

586
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,453
I'll be leaving Japan

587
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,354
next Wednesday on the afternoon flight.

588
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,622
Which airport? Narita or Haneda?

589
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,224
Narita.

590
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,096
So you're really going.

591
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,734
Let me be emotional,
if this is our last time.

592
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,703
As expected of you, Ms. Aoi.

593
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,439
You're already talking with the assumption

594
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,841
that you'll say no.

595
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,044
Alright, then.

596
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,246
I'll ask again.

597
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,282
Will you

598
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,418
come to New York with me?

599
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,221
Soseki…

600
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,125
It feels real when I say it.

601
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,293
Even though the answer's no.

602
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,131
Soseki, I'm sorry.

603
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,599
I can't come with you.

604
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,171
You just wanted to say that, huh?

605
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,839
You wanted to reject me.

606
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,142
-No! I was getting to the important part!
-What?

607
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,077
When I met you,

608
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,745
I thought it was the end of me.

609
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,116
I thought I had already peaked.

610
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,551
That no one cared about my work.

611
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,555
But I'm not my work.

612
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,524
I'm a human being, with a heart.

613
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,560
And hearts move.

614
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,929
And words pour out.

615
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,633
Those words,

616
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,434
those stories,

617
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,871
may move someone else's heart.

618
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,176
I'm a human, so I'll keep writing.

619
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,778
You made me

620
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,915
realize that.

621
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,251
That time,

622
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,419
you,

623
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,954
Soseki,

624
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,792
told me that you got into this industry
to work with me.

625
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,528
<i>And you cried for me.</i>

626
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,000
Because of those tears,

627
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,036
I can continue to write.

628
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,008
I'll keep

629
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,077
cheering you on from afar.

630
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,514
I'm alwayson your side.

631
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,487
Don't forget me!

632
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,962
Remember when that happened?

633
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,065
They tried to change the whole story.

634
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:07,999
It was scary.

635
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,441
Soseki!

636
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:20,011
Don't forget me!

637
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,015
You're a pretty powerful character.

638
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,886
I couldn't forget you,

639
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,020
even if I wanted to.

640
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:35,793
Hey…

641
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,764
I'll remember you each time I look

642
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,532
at a 1,000 yen bill.

643
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,968
Ms. Aoi.

644
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,372
The 1,000 yen bill isn't Soseki Natsume
anymore.

645
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,341
It's Hideyo Noguchi.

646
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,745
Oh, right.

647
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,683
But even then,

648
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,185
I won't forget you.

649
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,655
I promise.

650
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:06,824
You don't need to

651
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,826
promise.

652
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,870
I respect you, Mom.

653
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,272
You rely on men, then cut them off.

654
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,108
You cry, begging them to not forget you,

655
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,511
but you don't go to New York.

656
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,649
As expected of
the Queen of Romance Novels.

657
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,184
A professional woman!

658
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,219
You make me sound so evil.

659
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,722
So?

660
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,924
What about Ichinose?

661
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,161
What are you going to do?
You man magnet! Tell me!

662
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,697
-Stop it!
-Hey, you!

663
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,367
How nice, to be wanted!

664
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,836
You're really going?

665
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,973
Yes, to Okinawa.

666
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,308
I'll send you Okinawa shallots.

667
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,745
It'll be lonely around here.

668
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,246
Oh?

669
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,149
A friend request? Who is it?

670
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,287
KURUMI SAWANO

671
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,621
Kurumi?

672
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,159
I brought you these.

673
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,895
Work hard, alright?

674
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,331
What? That's it?

675
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,167
I'm in the middle of making deliveries.

676
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,808
Gorgonzola flavor?

677
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,309
It's pretty good.

678
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,555

685
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,140

688

<i>I'm no longer a woman that tags along</i>

00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,028
I'm so annoying!

693
00:34:58,996 --> 00:34:59,831
But,

694
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,266
this is my home base.

<i>THE WORLD WITH YOU</i>

696
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,978
I think
Mom's getting carried away these days.

697
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,546
That'll happen to anyone

698
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,315
if they're that popular.

699
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,649
You think?

700
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,652
We should all get carried away
when we have the chance.

701
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,020
It rarely happens.

702
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,390
Life is hard, huh?

703
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,893
RECEPTION COUNTER

704
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,996
Please accept this!

705
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,501
Award us with an honorable mention!

706
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,302
Please give us first place!

707
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,204
Seriously?

708
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,545
I'm so nervous.

709
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,521
Even if your mom goes to Okinawa,

710
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,790
I'll be here.

711
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,060
I'll be in Tokyo.

712
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,633
Even if your mom goes to New York,

713
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,034
I'll be in Tokyo.

714
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,405
That offer's gone.

715
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,775
Well, even if she stays, I'll be in Tokyo.

716
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,911
What are you saying?

717
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,048
That's all.

718
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,082
I'm finished.

719
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,960
OBAYASHI TOYS

720
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,965
Ms. Aoi.

721
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,101
Perfect timing.

722
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,571
I smelled freshly-baked bread.

723
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,839
I have a good nose.

724
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,651
Gon-chan hit you?

725
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,387
Just a little.

726
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,559
You're all cleaned up here.

727
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,029
I didn't have much luggage to begin with.

728
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,500
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

729
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,136
All you need to bring is yourself.

730
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,972
You can send your things later.

731
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,907
Of course,

732
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,142
you can join me in Okinawa later.

733
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,078
You have work, after all.

734
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,352
Hey.

735
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,486
No need to say anything.

736
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:37,855
It's tomorrow.

737
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,524
Please think about it carefully
until tomorrow.

738
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,961
Your heart can change very easily.

739
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,363
It's always been that way.

740
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,772
I just put

741
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,173
a spell on you.

742
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,143
A spell?

743
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,100
Maybe

744
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,037
Ichinose did it on purpose.

745
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,171
On purpose?

746
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,939
I won't give you Aoi or Sora!

747
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,875
Gon!

748
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,476
I'll protect them!

749
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,911
Aoi and Sora

750
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,179
are mine!

751
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,515
Maybe he went to Odaya on purpose

752
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,084
to say something to piss off Gon-chan,
and get hit.

753
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,052
Why?

754
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,889
So that you and Gon-chan

755
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:45,923
would get together.

756
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:47,925
What?

757
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,095
Gon-chan from the <i>taiyaki</i> shop?

758
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,463
I think it would be best

759
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,632
if Mom got together

760
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,966
with Gon-chan.

761
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,836
Gon-chan's her childhood friend.

762
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,505
He understands Mom the best.

763
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,941
He might not get

764
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,544
the more complicated parts,

765
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,746
but complicated parts are unnecessary,

766
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,114
don't you think?

767
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,085
That's an interesting opinion, Sora.

768
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,255
Mom needs Gon-chan.

769
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,591
He's like oxygen to her.

770
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,626
She thinks he'll always be there.

771
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,528
But if he goes away,

772
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,964
she'll be like a goldfish without air.

773
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,332
That's what I think.

774
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,901
Does your mom

775
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,770
like Gon?

776
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,907
I think so.

777
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,345
Maybe it's beyond the scope of romance.

778
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,481
But her first is always Gon-chan.

779
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,549
You said that to him?

780
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,851
I did.

781
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,921
Maybe Ichinose

782
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,357
tried to make Gon-chan realize.

783
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,961
Since Gon-chan always goes for
the young beauties.

784
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,364
"Aoi's the most important woman for you!"

785
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,133
He wanted him to realize.

786
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,467
He won't go for the young girls.

787
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,604
For Gon-chan, it's always been me.

788
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,874
Wow! How are you so confident?

789
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,877
Just because you're popular right now!
Women are so scary!

790
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,579
It's Ichinose's trap! It's a trick!

791
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,681
If my guess is right, that is.

792
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,086
Gon-chan tried to marry the young
and beautiful Aoba, remember!

793
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:23,954
Oh, you're right!

794
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,791
Now that you mention that,

795
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,961
there's no absolutes in life.

796
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,998
You never know what could happen.

797
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,200
But that's why

798
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,935
life is so fun!

799
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,205
You're so optimistic!

800
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,375
But for you, you think
I should be with Gon-chan?

801
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,577
What about the way I feel?

802
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:48,946
Mom.

803
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,416
Imagine that you're a three-year-old girl.

804
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,351
You walk along a thorny path.

805
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,387
You turn back.

806
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,456
Who's the person who always tags along

807
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,958
and smiles back at you?

808
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,329
ONE TIME, ONE MEETING

809
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,636
In front of me,

810
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,739
there's a three-year-old girl.

811
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,642
She's walking ahead of me.

812
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,044
I am worried

813
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,248
that she might trip.

814
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,917
No matter how old she is.

815
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,422
If it's a thorny path,

816
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,926
if life is a thorny path,
then I will always be worried.

817
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,563
I…

818
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:14,732
want to keep

819
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,237
watching over her for a little bit longer.

820
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,340
Just a little bit longer.

821
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,010
I want to watch over her.

822
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,616
I want to keep watching over her forever.

823
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,221
I don't want to be away from her.

824
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,196
I want to keep watching over her!

825
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,443
So you won't come with me?

826
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,146
I'm so sorry.

827
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:03,914
I see.

828
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,718
But…

829
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:08,953
It made me happy.

830
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,021
Thank you.

831
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,658
Sora told me.

832
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,494
You put on an act to

833
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,597
set off Gon-chan?

834
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,800
Did you do it on purpose

835
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,436
to make us realize what's most important

836
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:26,837
for us?

837
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:28,906
No.

838
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,508
I'm no saint.

839
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,478
You think?

840
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,682
Because of what you did,
I came to this conclusion.

841
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,285
It's because of you

842
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,520
I was able to realize

843
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,757
what's most important to me.

844
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,927
Maybe I had that thought
in the back of my mind.

845
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,631
I was wishing you'd get with Gon-chan.

846
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,235
I see.

847
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,405
So you weren't serious, huh?

848
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,408
You're wrong.

849
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:06,910
This is my last time with you.

850
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,980
Right?

851
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,184
So I'll tell you the truth.

852
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:16,820
Half of the truth is

853
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,356
what you just said.

854
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,558
But the other half…

855
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,628
is maybe a little more than that.

856
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,063
To be honest, more than half.

857
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,601
I made excuses for myself,

858
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,370
dreaming about how nice it would be

859
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,905
if I could get back

860
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,675
together with you.

861
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,681
And how nice it would be
to meet Sora frequently.

862
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,018
I was only thinking about myself.

863
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,623
I'm sorry that

864
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,158
we can't get back together.

865
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,326
No.

866
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,898
I'll always think back
on the time I spent here.

867
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,068
So I'll be happy going forward.

868
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,272
In the heavy letterpress

869
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,709
black-and-white literary magazine,

870
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,679
I have a new color-print page.

871
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,219
Mommy!

872
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,292
Mom!

873
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,828
Dad!

874
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,998
I'm gonna jump, so watch me!

875
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,836
She's a little kid right now.

876
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,087
I want to ask you something.

877
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,457
Please give me

878
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,926
those photos of the sky.

879
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,595
The photo album

880
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,730
with a picture of me at the very end.

881
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,134
Sure.

882
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,276
Can I take

883
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,745
a photo of you for

884
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:23,514
the last page?

885
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,420
Say cheese!

886
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,724
-Let's take one, all together!
-Yeah!

887
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,859
-Could you take a photo of us?
-Oh.

888
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,194
Sure.

889
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,266
Could you move in a little closer?

890
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,469
That's great.

891
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,137
How nice!

892
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,476
-Be well, you two.
-Yeah!

893
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,311
You too, Dad.

894
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,212
You too, Fuga.

895
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,702
Maguroyaki?

896
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,137
Yes, and make it this big!

897
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,473
That's impossible! How many kilograms
of bean paste would I need?

898
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,375
Wait…

899
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:26,476
Maybe it's possible.

900
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,112
-For weddings, instead of cake.
-Yes.

901
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,013
Right?

902
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,884
I have to outgrow my child.
Sora will go away one day.

903
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,386
-I'm not going anywhere.
-What?

904
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,956
People have all kinds of tastes, you know.

905
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,725
Some weirdos might start swarming
around you. Become a grandma already!

906
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,928
What the hell?
That's how you flirt with me?

907
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,331
I'm not flirting with you!

908
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,273
MINATO BOOK CENTER

909
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,241
Sorry for the wait!

910
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,880
Thank you.

911
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,121

Can I tell you something?

916
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,575
What?

917
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,444
I don't actually have a girlfriend.

918
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,381
Huh? What about Kokoro?

919
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,949
Kokoro with the high hips?

920
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:42,019
That's Kokoro Hasegawa!

921
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,754

00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,226
What?

924
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,707

Congratulations, congratulations!

Congratulations!

929
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,624
Thank you, thank you!

930
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,225
Thank you, thank you!

931
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,927
Thank you, thank you!

932
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,396
-Thank you, thank you!
-No, it's like this.

933
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,364
Like this.

934
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,066
Thank you, thank you!

935
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,102
Thank you, thank you!
Thank you, thank you!

936

Scissors, shoot!

938
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,279
I did it!

939
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,448
-Mom wins!
-Hey!

940
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,551
