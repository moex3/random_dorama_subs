1
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,008
I can't believe this.

2
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,347
MANGA ARTIST AIKA KAKUTA'S
FORBIDDEN RELATIONSHIP WITH HER LOVER

3
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,476
Right, you're a huge fan of her,
aren't you?

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,937
The way she draws
heroines yearning for love

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,814
is amazing.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,567
But she's having an affair…

7
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,739
Guess she wanted love
from more men than just her husband.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>Guess that means she's having sex</i>
<i>with others as well as her husband.</i>

9
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,584
-Were you a fan of her too?
-Huh?

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,169
You look troubled.

11
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,379
Ah, no.

12
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,299
Are you worried about
what happened this morning?

13
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,592
This morning?

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:37,096
I saw Ms. Misono scold you
for the mishap with the internal data.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,973
That's embarrassing.

16
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,268
Ms. Misono's gotten so strict
since she became a manager.

17
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,979
It was my mistake, though.

18
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,649
Ms. Misono has her walls up so high.

19
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,152
I wonder if she's ever
opened up to anyone else.

20
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,405
Oh! Do you know the rumor about her?

21
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,407
Rumor?

22
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,868
I overheard it in the girl's bathroom.

23
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,787
Rumor has it she's a virgin.

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,996
A virgin?

25
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,166
Later-in-life virgins are becoming common.

26
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,587
I mean, not that it matters.

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,840
It's their own choice after all.

28
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,343
Come to think of it, a friend of mine

29
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,805
for some reason
always dates girls who are virgins.

30
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,308
He said breaking down their guard
is like doing construction work.

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,062
Construction work?

32
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,064
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

33
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,317
<i>In the 32 years since I was born</i>

34
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,779
<i>I have not had sex even once.</i>

35
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,866
Kosaka.

36
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,033
What's wrong?

37
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,119
Oh, nothing's wrong.

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,037
Sorry.

39
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,333
The interview…

40
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,336
<i>I've been doing</i>
<i>a fairly good job getting by</i>

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,756
<i>as a working adult.</i>

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>But when it comes to sex…</i>

43
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,386
Ms. Misono,
your earrings are really pretty.

44
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,265
My boyfriend gave them to me.
Anyways, these documents…

45
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,060
<i>If she has a boyfriend,</i>
<i>she must be having sex too.</i>

46
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,354
You're not making clear
what you want to say.

47
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,064
-Redo from scratch?
-From scratch.

48
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,740
<i>I wonder how it feels</i>
<i>to be touched by someone else.</i>

49
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>It's not the same doing it yourself.</i>

50
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,251
<i>I want to also be someone</i>
<i>that has experienced sex.</i>

51
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>"We welcome women who want to have sex!"</i>

52
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,642
<i>No way, never.</i>

53
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,394
<i>That's definitely</i>
<i>way beyond what I can handle.</i>

54
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,235
HEY HERE'S THE INVITATION
TO THE REUNION PARTY CHECK IT OUT

55
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,445
A reunion party…

56
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,786
Your nails look different
than usual, Kosaka.

57
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,580
-Huh?
-You usually keep them looking natural.

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,581
Oh.

59
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,960
I have a reunion today,
so I went with something a bit fancier.

60
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,296
The matte style you have
is nice too, Ms. Kodaira.

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,798
You think so?

62
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,761
It doesn't go down well with men, though.
Especially because I'm ugly too.

63
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:27,225
By the way, I've been meaning to tell you,
you don't have to be formal with me.

64
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,977
I'm just a temp, after all.

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,186
Right.

66
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,108
<i>Sometimes I have no clue</i>
<i>how to answer Kodaira.</i>

67
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,110
She has a fever?

68
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,613
I understand.

69
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,615
I'll come pick her up right away.

70
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,496
-Was it from day care?
-Yes.

71
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,165
It's the third time this month.

72
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,917
That's rough.

73
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,463
I have to prepare 50 copies
of this document before seven…

74
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,182
Shall I do them?

75
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,518
Thank you.

76
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,145
I'm really sorry.

77
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,187
It's fine.

78
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,660
Okay, I'll make it in time.

79
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,670
SORRY I'M LATE

80
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:44,510
I'M LEAVING THE OFFICE SOON
SO I SHOULD BE THERE A LITTLE PAST EIGHT!

81
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,345
Huh?

82
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,983
Okay.

83
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,116
Huh?

84
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,951
What?

85
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,704
How do I fix this?

86
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,837
PLEASE CONTACT EIKOU MAINTENANCE
FOR USAGE GUIDELINES AND REPAIR REQUESTS

87
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,771
I'm from Eikou.

88
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,153
Oh.

89
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,949
Thank you for coming so quickly.

90
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,576
My name is Kosaka.

91
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,040
Oh.

92
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,050
Nice to meet you.

93
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,260
EIKOU MAINTENANCE ENGINEER

94
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,220
Kagiya, is it?

95
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,395
I'm sorry to be rude,
but I need the copies as fast as possible,

96
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,771
so please hurry.

97
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:20,731
Yes.

98
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,235
I'll let you know when I'm done.

99
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,153
Oh.

100
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,655
Okay.

101
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,711
Thank goodness, I'll make it in time.

102
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,222
That'll be it from me.

103
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,229
Kagiya.

104
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,736
Thank you so much. You saved me.

105
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,585
Alright! Cheers!

106
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,507
Your job is tough, huh?

107
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,592
I just had a few issues come up.

108
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,136
Your nails are so cute, Maiko.

109
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,389
You think so?
I'm trying a different color.

110
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,017
How nice. I haven't had
my nails done since I had my youngest.

111
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,353
I know, right? There's just no time.

112
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,272
My wife said the same.

113
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,524
I see.

114
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,443
<i>I would much rather</i>
<i>have sex, like you can,</i>

115
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,321
<i>than have pretty nails.</i>

116
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,949
-Aren't you going to get married?
-Huh?

117
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,450
Do you have a boyfriend?

118
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,869
Not at the moment.

119
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,788
<i>Actually, it's been ages.</i>

120
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,082
I'm sorry I'm late.

121
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,334
-Oh!
-Saeki, you're late!

122
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,378
Sorry. I had to work overtime.

123
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,171
Can I sit here?

124
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,423
Uh, sure.

125
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,095
Long time no see, Kosaka.

126
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,098
I haven't seen you since graduation.

127
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,559
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

128
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,769
-One glass, please.
-Coming right up.

129
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,364
S-Saeki, I…

130
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:21,037
<i>Saeki was my first and last boyfriend.</i>

131
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,131
<i>And the only one</i>
<i>with whom I ever had that chance.</i>

132
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,515
I-I'm sorry.

133
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>I'd go 14 years without another chance.</i>

134
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,775
-Who's up for an after-party?
-Me!

135
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,984
You coming, Maiko?

136
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,028
I'm sorry. I have to get up early.

137
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,987
Really?

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,948
-I'll pass on it too.
-You too, Saeki?

139
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,410
I live really far away.
If I come along, I'll miss the last train.

140
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,953
What?

141
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,372
Have fun, guys.

142
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,375
Okay, then. Let's go.

143
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,628
Everyone's exactly the same, huh?

144
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,545
Yeah.

145
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,382
They haven't changed
despite becoming parents.

146
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,303
<i>I wonder if he's married.</i>

147
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,224
I'm glad I made it today.

148
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,141
Huh?

149
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,436
I'm being transferred to Sendai next week.

150
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,690
I'll probably be living there for a while.

151
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,150
I see.

152
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,112
The next time we meet
may be 10 years from now.

153
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,906
In 10 years…

154
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,909
<i>Could this be my chance?</i>

155
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:47,123
<i>If it's with Saeki,</i>
<i>it could just be a one-time thing…</i>

156
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,085
Huh?

157
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,503
Are you okay?

158
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,713
Oh. Yeah.

159
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,800
Later-in-life virgins are becoming common.

160
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,387
He said breaking down their guard is
like doing construction work.

161
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,309
<i>If I lose this chance</i>
<i>I might never get it again.</i>

162
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,354
Saeki.

163
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,445
I have a really strange thing
to ask of you.

164
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,198
Can you try not to get weirded out by it?

165
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,041
I'm…

166
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,004
A virgin.

167
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,215
Huh?

168
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,342
It's weird, isn't it?

169
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,428
Uh, no…

170
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,389
Are you married?

171
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,849
Huh?

172
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,059
Do you have a girlfriend?

173
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
What?

174
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,942
If you don't mind…

175
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,447
Could you do it with me?

176
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,449
Pardon?

177
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,746
No strings attached, just for tonight.

178
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,668
I won't tell anyone…

179
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,129
So please.

180
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,104
Are you sure about this?

181
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,525
Yes.

182
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,276
Of course.

183
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,321
Do you want to take a shower first?

184
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,280
Huh?

185
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,618
I guess you're not sweaty. Never mind.

186
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,827
Ah…

187
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,121
Yeah.

188
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,808
<i>So this is how it feels</i>

189
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,645
<i>to be touched by someone.</i>

190
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,526
<i>It's colder than I thought.</i>

191
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,825
I'll touch it, okay?

192
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,869
Okay…

193
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,058
Does it hurt?

194
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,602
No, it's fine.

195
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,825
Can I put it in?

196
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,746
Please.

197
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,177
Ouch!

198
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,679
Are you okay?

199
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,347
I-I'm sorry.

200
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,986
I got a little sweaty,
so I'll go take a shower.

201
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,278
Wait a little, okay?

202
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>Why are you running away?</i>

203
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,509
<i>This time I won't run.</i>

204
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,405
Saeki!

205
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,664
What happened?

206
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,999
Why are you leaving?

207
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,338
Did I do something wrong?

208
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,594
I can't do this after all.

209
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,433
I can't do it with you.

210
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,783
Kagiya…

212
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,213
<i>Everyone else is able to do it,</i>

213
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,466
<i>so why am I the only one that can't?</i>

214
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,188
Oh no!

215
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,361
Come on…

216
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,991
Dinner is ready.

217
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,620
Miyuki.

218
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,622
I'm busy, so don't talk to me.

219
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,299
SHO, 27 YEARS OLD, TOKYO

220
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,260
You're Ren, right?

221
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,596
I'm Sho.

222
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,391
Yeah. I'm Ren.

223
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,685
Shall we go to a hotel?

224
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,727
What?

225
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,398
Oh. Okay.

226
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,761
<i>Is what I want</i>
<i>really that much to ask for?</i>

227
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>All I want is to have gentle sex.</i>

228
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,026
It won't ever happen for me, will it?

229
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,653
I never expected to talk about games here.

230
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>I have to go pick her up at day care.</i>

231
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,781
It's tough being a mom.

232
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,367
<i>Why does everyone only see me as a mother?</i>

233
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,077
I want to go somewhere private.

234
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>Wait, does that mean…?</i>
