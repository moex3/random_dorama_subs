1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:09,968
<i>Everyone else is able to do it,</i>
<i>so why am I the only one that can't?</i>

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>I've been doing</i>

3

<i>as a working adult.</i>

4
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,647
<i>But when it comes to sex…</i>

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>I want to also be someone</i>
<i>that has experienced sex.</i>

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>Thanks for yesterday. Here's the picture!</i>

7
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>In my 32 years,</i>
<i>I've never experienced having sex,</i>

8
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,303
<i>but the chance to</i>
<i>finally came around yesterday.</i>

9
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,763
I'm sorry I'm late.

10
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,973
-Oh!
-Saeki, you're late!

11
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,643
Long time no see, Kosaka.

12
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,062
Saeki.

13
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,108
If you don't mind…

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,070
Could you do it with me?

15
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,030
Can I put it in?

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,576
Please.

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,786
Ouch!

18
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,788
Are you okay?

19
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,131
Saeki!

20
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,591
What happened? Why are you leaving?

21
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,635
I can't do it with you.

22
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,803
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,606
It won't ever happen for me, will it?

24
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,154
-There you are, Kosaka.
-Good morning.

25
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,574
Good morning.
Thank you for staying late yesterday.

26
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,491
No problem.

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,326
This is for you.

28
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,038
My husband went on
a business trip to Okinawa.

29
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,874
It's a souvenir from there.

30
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,959
<i>Chin</i>… <i>suko</i>?

31
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,712
CHINSUKO

32
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,305
<i>Since when did my urges get so strong</i>
<i>that I get worked up over biscuits?</i>

33
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,390
Are you okay?

34
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,934
Oh… Yes.

35
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,687
Don't tell me…

36
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,106
-Love troubles?
-Huh?

37
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:14,611
I was like that too when I was single.
I had nothing but love on my mind.

38
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,529
No, it's nothing like that.

39
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,947
Listen, Kosaka.

40
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,242
The more pillars, the better, okay?

41
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,452
Pillars?

42
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,494
Yes.

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,624
You know, the ones that hold houses up.

44
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,251
For me…

45
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,547
I have one for my family,
my work and my hobbies.

46
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,593
My hobby is creating mangas
with my friends.

47
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,223
Those three are what hold me up.

48
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,144
If I was left with only one…

49
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,524
Oh.

50
00:03:55,693 --> 00:04:00,281
If you focus too much on one thing
then the balance gets thrown off.

51
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,575
I see.

52
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,453
Have these, okay?

53
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,664
Thank you.

54
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,377
<i>Pillars, huh?</i>

55
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,678
Hello? Miu?

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,304
<i>Sorry to call you so early.</i>

57
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,474
<i>You said your daughter</i>
<i>spilled juice on the work?</i>

58
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,892
She did.

59
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,561
So could we push the deadline a bit?

60
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,982
<i>We'll publish someone else's work</i>
<i>this time around.</i>

61
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,899
Huh?

62
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,153
<i>You're a mom, so don't overwork yourself.</i>
<i>Let's try again next time.</i>

63
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,239
Yeah.

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,074
Thanks.

65
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,914
A bar by the station?

66
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,750
Everything is half price
because of their anniversary.

67
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,211
I have three of these,
should we go together?

68
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,380
I was thinking about going.

69
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,673
How about you, Somei?

70
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,511
I want to go,
but I have to pick up my daughter.

71
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,805
Right, of course.

72
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,598
Sorry.

73
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,808
Don't apologize.

74
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,311
How about lunch, then?

75
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,812
You think it'll be open?

76
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,522
-Let's look it up.
-Okay.

77
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,441
What do you think?

78
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,780
Which one?

79
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,257
<i>I can't do it with you.</i>

80
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,216
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,391
Kagiya…

82
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,330
Good work.

83
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,172
Is it broken?

84
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,008
No, just regular maintenance.

85
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,760
Oh.

86
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,226
Um…

87
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,395
I'm sorry you had
to see that the other day.

88
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:38,981
See what?

89
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,525
Last Friday.

90
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,569
Uh…

91
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,697
That's not what you wanted to talk about?

92
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,866
Uh, no.

93
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:56,040
They asked me to restock the toner supply,
but the person in charge has gone out.

94
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,751
Could you let me into the storage room?

95
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,129
Oh.

96
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>He probably</i>
<i>never spared it a second thought.</i>

97
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
The other day…

98
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,144
-Your boyfriend--
-He isn't my boyfriend.

99
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,354
We went to the same school.

100
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,606
Oh. I see.

101
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,735
I'll take you to the storage room.

102
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,658
<i>The embarrassment might just kill me.</i>

103
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,545
It's the shelf in the back.

104
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,385
Huh?

105
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,017
It's fine.

106
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,530
That's Pac-Man, right?

107
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,073
Huh?

108
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,411
Oh. Yeah.

109
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,373
My dad loved it,
so I used to play a lot as a kid.

110
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,458
Same!

111
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,628
Uh, me too.

112
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,881
It's so hard getting the fruits.

113
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,634
I can't get past level eight.

114
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,136
I got to 21.

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,597
Wow, really?

116
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,890
How did you do it?

117
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:41,646
Each ghost has its own territory
and moves in a specific pattern.

118
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,691
Kagiya. You really know your stuff.

119
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,861
I suppose.

120
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,243
Thank goodness.

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,994
What?

122
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,624
I embarrassed myself earlier, so…

123
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:09,048
I also never expected it
to turn into a talk about video games.

124
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,681
Oh.

125
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,598
What?

126
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,519
I need to hand in the papers
I printed before the meeting starts.

127
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,397
I can take care of
the rest here, so go ahead.

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,400
-Sorry. Thank you.
-Sure.

129

I'm exhausted.

168
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
What's that?

169
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,069
It's a place close to the company.

170
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,575
They asked me to come drink
on Friday, but I said no.

171
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,995
You should go.

172
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,122
Huh?

173
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,042
On Friday I just have to stay
for a meeting that ends at five.

174
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,502
I'll pick up Hina.

175
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,379
Really?

176
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,673
Thank you, Hide.

177
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,219
Kosaka.

178
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,679
Where is the data from the last interview?

179
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,681
One second.

180
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,647
I booked us a table for six o'clock today.

181
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,232
Thank you.

182
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,734
It's been ages
since the three of us went drinking.

183
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,862
We used to go often
before Somei's maternity leave.

184
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,240
We should thank your husband.

185
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,075
Okay.

186
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,744
Let's all work hard
so we don't have to stay longer.

187
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,922
DAYCARE

188
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,757
You've got to be kidding…

189
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,763
Hello.

190
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,185
Okay.

191
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,354
I'll come now.

192
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,653
<i>Hidenao said he's in a meeting until five…</i>

193
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,700
What is it?

194
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,787
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,623
I have to go pick her up at daycare.

196
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,083
What?

197
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,710
She has a fever again.

198
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,421
I'm really sorry.

199
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,256
Don't be.

200
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,966
Don't worry about us.

201
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,343
It's tough being a mom.

202
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,435
You already made the booking,
so you guys go have fun, okay?

203
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:20,461
I GAVE HER SOME MEDICINE
THE FEVER WENT DOWN, SO DON'T WORRY

204
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,050
<i>You're a mom, so don't overwork yourself.</i>

205
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,177
<i>It's tough being a mom.</i>

206
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:36,769
<i>Why does everyone only see me as a mother?</i>

207
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,815
<i>I'm a manga artist, and an office worker.</i>

208
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,818
<i>I just happen to be a mom on top of that.</i>

209
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,531
Cheers!

210
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,658
Here's your pasta.

211
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,910
Oh, it looks amazing.

212
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,206
It's so good.
We have to bring Somei here sometime.

213
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,123
Right.

214
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,626
Thank goodness.

215
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,212
Huh?

216
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,131
I thought you maybe wouldn't come.

217
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,591
Why?

218
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:12,096
You don't seem to be very
fond of getting drinks just the two of us.

219
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,139
That's not true.

220
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:20,020
<i>I suppose it's true that I've rarely</i>
<i>gone drinking alone with a guy before.</i>

221
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,981
Let's share this.

222
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,273
Okay.

223
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,363
<i>Now that he said it,</i>
<i>I'm suddenly self-conscious about it.</i>

224
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,411
<i>No way.</i>

225
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>He has a girlfriend.</i>

226
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,375
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

227
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,463
Is your girlfriend okay
with you coming home this late?

228
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,133
Oh.

229
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,886
You've been together five years, was it?
That's so long.

230
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,555
Are you considering marriage?

231
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,515
I guess.

232
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,647
<i>Hara has two pillars.</i>
<i>Work and a girlfriend.</i>

233
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,275
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

234
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,281
I broke up with her.

235
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,867
Huh?

236
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,628
I'M GLAD HER FEVER IS DOWN

237
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,839
SOMETHING HAPPENED
SO I CAN'T LEAVE YET I'M SORRY!

238
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,008
SORRY

239
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,102
<i>You wouldn't have</i>
<i>been able to pick up Hina after all.</i>

240
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,320
I'M FINE

241
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,740
KIYOKAWA

242
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:04,083

KIYOKAWA RINTARO

244
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:27,231
RINTARO KIYOKAWA #GOLDISMINEONGOINGSERIES

245
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,157
AMAZING! I WAS EXCITED FOR THE NEW SERIES
LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE GORGEOUS DRAWINGS

246
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,701
I'M A HUGE FAN!
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW SERIES

247
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,453
<i>Amazing…</i>

248
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,623
<i>Kiyokawa really made his dream come true.</i>

249
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,628
<i>All I'm doing is</i>
<i>causing trouble for everyone.</i>

250
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,089
<i>Everything I do is half-baked.</i>

251
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,055
<i>It wasn't supposed to be this way.</i>

252
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,727
I really loved her.
I wanted to be with her forever.

253
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,399
Is that why you asked us to come today?

254
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,943
I didn't want to be alone.

255
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,280
I can't stop thinking even at work.

256
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,534
I'm past 30,
but what am I doing with my life?

257
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,706
<i>Maybe that girlfriend was his only pillar.</i>

258
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,375
<i>But then…</i>

259
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,919
<i>If he lost the only pillar he had…</i>

260
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,382
Are you okay to stay longer, Kosaka?

261
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,593
Yeah, I'm fine.

262
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,018
Want to go somewhere a bit more quiet?

263
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,519
What?

264
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,022
I want to go somewhere private.

265
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,650
<i>Wait, does that mean…?</i>

266
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,112
Excuse me. Can we have the bill?

267
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,283
<i>Will Hara and I…</i>

268
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,122
<i>Is it okay to make a mistake with me?</i>

269
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,749
<i>The gap keeps getting wider…</i>

270
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,460
If you're no help, then just quit already.

271
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,128
I said it's nothing!

272
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,590
There's a retro game-café
I frequent close to here.

273
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>Could this be leading to…?</i>
