1
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,432
<i>Could this be leading to…?</i>

2
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,935
I broke up with her.

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,980
I want to go somewhere private.

4
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>Is it okay to make a mistake with me?</i>

5
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,823
Sorry. The bathroom had a line.

6
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,616
Oh. It's fine.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,379
It was a sexless relationship.

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:51,968
What?

9
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,012
It was a sexless relationship.

10
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:38,973
What?

11
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,101
That's why we broke up.

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,272
I see.

13
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,442
Yeah.

14
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,279
Kosaka, are you uncomfortable
talking about stuff like this?

15
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,366
I just wanted to talk to someone about it.

16
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,743
No, it's fine.

17
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,870
Go ahead.

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,291
<i>I can't usually hear</i>
<i>about other people's sex lives.</i>

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,335
<i>I want to know.</i>

20
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,716
Well…

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,969
I'm not sure where to start.

22
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,766
I'm probably asexual.

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,102
Asexual?

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,732
I can have romantic feelings for someone,
but I have no sexual desires.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,780
I think it was around puberty…

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,411
Everyone was reading dirty magazines,
but I had no interest whatsoever.

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,164
Honestly, I didn't like them.

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,752
I did my best and
slept with her a few times.

29
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,046
But something kept feeling off.

30
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:58,720
Then I found out about asexuality online
and thought, "Oh, that's me."

31
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,681
I wasn't the only one.

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,558
<i>Hey.</i>

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,768
Let's do it.

34
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,480
Sorry.

35
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm feeling tired today.

36
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,902
Some other time.

37
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,739
"Some other time"?

38
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,407
What?

39
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:25,872
I'm always the one asking,
and you keep turning me down.

40
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,292
Don't you get how miserable it makes me?

41
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,088
<i>I really loved her, but…</i>

42
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,927
I felt bad.

43
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,846
And…

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,811
I didn't think we could ever
have closed it.

45
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,022
Huh?

46
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
The gap between us.

47
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,285
Nowadays there are all types of people.

48
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,164
I might have a chance
with someone like me.

49
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,791
So I haven't given up.

50
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>To think he'd have</i>
<i>the exact opposite problem.</i>

51
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,008
<i>Everyone has their own thing, I guess.</i>

52
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,015
Sorry. I got drunk and
might have said too much.

53
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,184
No, not at all.

54
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,311
I was the one who told you to.

55
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,356
You know I was raised overseas.

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,525
And hugging is common over there.

57
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,360
Uh, right.

58
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,863
So, can I hug you?

59
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,824
A wholesome one.

60
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,326
Wait, are you drunk?

61
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,413
As a colleague and a friend.

62
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,540
A pure and clean hug.

63
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,711
Okay.

64
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,262
I wonder why…

65
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,599
When I like physical touch like this…

66
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,772
<i>Yeah.</i>

67
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,736
<i>It must be amazing to have someone</i>
<i>to touch in this way.</i>

68
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,370
Seriously…

69
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,664
Who wrote this draft?

70
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,085
I did. Is there something…

71
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,965
His name is Hashigodaka not Kuchitaka!

72
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,385
How can you get the name wrong?
Are you a rookie?

73
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,179
Oh… I am sorry.

74
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,182
Hey.

75
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,519
What do you think makes work possible?

76
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,649
It's trust. Trust!

77
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,570
Everything can collapse in an instant.

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,456
Are you okay?

79
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,166
Yeah, I'm fine.

80
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,793
I'm the one who messed up.

81
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,766
I'm home.

82
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,772
Come on.

83
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,859
You could've given her a bath.

84
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,069
Yeah.

85
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,154
You're late, Mom.

86
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,116
Sorry. I'll make dinner now.

87
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,255
<i>Thanks for the follow.</i>
<i>What has it been, 13 years?</i>

88
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,256
Hmm?

89
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,424
Oh, nothing.

90
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>Wait, it's really you?</i>

91
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,185
LOL

92
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,355
<i>I was surprised to see you got serialized.</i>

93
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,651
<i>How about you?</i>
<i>Are you still drawing manga?</i>

94
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,197
<i>Yeah, I self-publish.</i>

95
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,075
<i>I see, that's great.</i>

96
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,454
<i>I might be receiving</i>
<i>the next Sosho Art Manga Award.</i>

97
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,791
<i>It's a lot of pressure.</i>

98
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,585
What is it?

99
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,546
It's nothing.

100
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,259
The Sosho Art Manga Award…

101
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,427
<i>That's amazing.</i>

102
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,804
<i>The gap keeps getting wider…</i>

103
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,140
Hmm? Something's definite--

104
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,725
I said it's nothing!

105
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,494
I found another place that looks good.

106
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,454
A sheep bar?

107
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,707
Also! Aren't you doing nothing
but drink recently?

108
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,750
Ouch.

109
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,422
Huh?

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,424
What?

111
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,343
Has something happened?

112
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,137
Oh, no.

113
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,433
I just read manga until late last night.

114
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
Was it Kakuta's new one?

115
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,646
No.

116
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,773
Someone I know.

117
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,234
What? You know a professional artist?

118
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,193
That's cool.

119
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,031
Does your husband read them too?

120
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,115
Mangas?

121
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,784
Not at all.

122
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,787
He understands the appeal
but isn't interested.

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,080
I see.

124
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,332
Then what prompted you?

125
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,250
Huh?

126
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,753
To date, and marry your husband.

127
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,675
Who asks something like that?

128
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,680
It's so good.

129
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,475
You really like these, don't you?

130
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,572
Is your stomach acting up?

131
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,242
Is there a toilet around here?

132
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,454
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

133
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,707
<i>Right in the middle of a date…</i>

134
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,886
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,726
Huh?

136
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,352
Nana the glutton.

137
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,148
How fun.

138
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,576
<i>It was fun.</i>

139
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,705
Whenever I was with him.

140
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,083
Fun.

141
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,055
<i>Oh no. Why am I thinking about Kagiya?</i>

142
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,474
I get it.

143
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,476
You do?

144
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,738
ENERGY PARTNERS

145
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,198
Oh.

146
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,454
You're…

147
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,291
Kosaka.

148
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,752
Are you on your way home from work?

149
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,545
Yes.

150
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,718
The station is this way, isn't it?

151
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,887
Oh, no.

152
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,599
I'm dropping by somewhere on the way.

153
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,024
There's a retro game-café
I frequent close to here.

154
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,194
Retro games?
Do you play with your friends?

155
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,406
No.

156
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,574
By myself.

157
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,411
By yourself…

158
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,874
Um!

159
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,464
Can I come with you?

160
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,883
What?

161
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,014
DENKIYA HALL

162
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,368
Wow! It's really Pac-Man!

163
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,332
Will you be getting the usual iced coffee?

164
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,793
Yes.

165
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,379
I'll have the same.

166
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,338
Yes.

167
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:42,553
Um, does this actually work?

168
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,931
It does.

169
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,888
You're so good at it!

170
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,848
The ghosts can't get you at all.

171
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,226
I played it quite a bit at one point.

172
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,270
It's embarrassing.

173
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,314
No, it's impressive.

174
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,567
I know you don't get this good
by just doing it casually.

175
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,613
Would you like to try?

176
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,699
Yes.

177
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,799
<i>That's the first time I've seen his face.</i>

178
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,595
Good night.

179
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,562
Is Dad not coming home yet?

180
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,897
No.

181
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,695
I'm home.

182
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,780
Welcome back.

183
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,075
Hide, about what happened yesterday…

184
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,833
I'll put these in here.

185
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,459
Huh?

186
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,089
You like these, don't you, Mom?

187
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,675
Uh, yeah.

188
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,511
This one is for Hina.

189
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,930
Um…

190
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,142
Are you not mad about yesterday?

191
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,184
Yesterday?

192
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh. I forgot.

193
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,360
Is it strawberry? I want it!

194
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,863
Not now. After dinner.

195
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,323
You need a bath first.

196
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,365
Let's eat them.

197
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,451
Huh?

198
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,537
Let's have them now.

199
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,878
Thank you.

200
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,255
Hmm?

201
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,174
For what?

202
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,800
Well…

203
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,303
Everything.

204
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,895
<i>I was all over the place</i>
<i>just a moment ago,</i>

205
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,774
<i>but Hidenao made me feel so much better.</i>

206
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>I'm so simple.</i>

207
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,279
<i>But that's who I am.</i>

208
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,448
What's going on?

209
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,663
And stop calling me "Mom."

210
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,998
That's for Hina to do.

211
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,343
Oh, um,
what was the name of the red ghost again?

212
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,179
Pinky-inky?

213
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,555
And…

214
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,351
It's Blinky.

215
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,562
You remembered it well.

216
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,523
<i>He smiled.</i>

217
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,734
Oh.

218
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,486
Let me do it.

219
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,870
<i>It's warm.</i>

220
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,387
WE'RE HAVING YAKISOBA TODAY

221
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,268
I'm home.

222
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,272
Welcome home.

223
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,984
You should've gone ahead and eaten.

224
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,403
I didn't want to eat alone.

225
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,833
Is it good?

226
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,001
Yeah.

227
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,132
You're working overtime a lot lately.

228
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,842
Are you okay?

229
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,969
What do you mean?

230
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,679
I mean, your body.

231
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,766
Oh. Yeah, my body is fine.

232
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,852
The stress is what's bad.

233
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,395
What?

234
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,940
The young ones are so useless.

235
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,944
They leave on the dot
even if they still have work to do.

236
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,404
It's unbelievable.

237
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,827
Working too hard
doesn't seem to be trendy these days.

238
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,457
That's not my point.

239
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,335
If you don't want to be there

240
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,546
and you're no help,
then just quit already.

241
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,298
They get paid for nothing.

242
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,094
What?

243
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,097
Nothing.

244
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,392
What about you?

245
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,229
You're home early a lot lately.

246
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,107
Yeah, I finished the big project.

247
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,150
Oh.

248
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,653
Take a look at this.

249
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,530
It's coming out next week.

250
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,317
Miyuki.

251
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,695
I'm tired.

252
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,114
I would rather spend that time sleeping.

253
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,999
You can dash by eating cookies…

254
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,042
Oh, you're right!

255
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,836
It's the flavor of adulthood.

256
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,339
Next time you can have some too, Hina.

257
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>It's our 10th year living together.</i>

258
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>Makoto is gentle and calm.</i>

259
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,855
<i>I didn't realize it at the time.</i>

260
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,735
<i>That I was taking this</i>
<i>happiness for granted.</i>

261
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,944
That was close.

262
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,571
That was Blinky.

263
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,156
That one was Blinky.

264
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,326
<i>Would you like to go for dinner together?</i>

265
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>She kept saying we'd work hard together,</i>
<i>but quit right away.</i>

266
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:06,914
Um.

267
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,042
I've never been in a woman's home before.
I'm a little nervous.

268
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>I want to touch him.</i>

269
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,171
<i>Right now, that's all.</i>
