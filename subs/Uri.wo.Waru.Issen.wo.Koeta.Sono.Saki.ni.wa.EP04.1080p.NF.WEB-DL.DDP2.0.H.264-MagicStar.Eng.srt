1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,847
This is hard…

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,058
You don't have to move if you can't.

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,980
The ghosts have gathered.

4
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,525
Then in one go, like this…

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,407
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,747
I'll take over.

7
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,542
I'm surprised by how good you were.

8
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,589
You'll beat my high score in no time.

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,636
<i>And then I remember my own status.</i>

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>Thirty-two years old.</i>

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,851
<i>A virgin.</i>

12
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,151
Well…

13
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,905
I have to go this way.

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,864
Oh.

15
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,409
Thank you for today.

16
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,786
Oh, no.

17
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,996
The pleasure is all mine.

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,044
Well then.

19
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,712
Oh, Kagiya!

20
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,177
Would you like to…

21
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,347
go for dinner together?

22
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,975
Huh?

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,654
Yes.

24
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,332
Oh, Nana!

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,585
It's been ages!

26
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,461
Oh, Mrs. Tsuji.

27
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,964
I heard you got hired again
as a part-timer.

28
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:57,051
I did! So, as a way to say hello, here.

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,344
It's homemade.

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,513
Thank you so much.

31
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,473
Did you gain weight, Nana?

32
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,269
Oh, I did. I had a baby girl, so…

33
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,604
Is that Mrs. Tsuji?

34
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,440
The one who didn't get along
with Ms. Misono, right?

35
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Yeah.

36
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,359
She's intense.

37
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,405
My son got into the middle school
he wanted, so I also…

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,364
<i>Sakie Tsuji.</i>

39
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,033
… wanted to get out and about.

40
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>We got hired at the same time.</i>

41
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,871
Well, my husband is a dentist,
so we have money, but…

42
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,831
<i>We used to be best friends.</i>

43
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,126
I'll go say hi to the others.
Good morning!

44
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,753
-Good morning.
-I'm Tsuji.

45
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:36,883
<i>She kept saying we'd work hard together,</i>
<i>but she got married and quit right away.</i>

46
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,057
Long time no see, Miyuki.

47
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,977
I'll be coming twice a week from now on.

48
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,022
Here, have some.

49
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,440
No thanks.

50
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,320
<i>Now, she has become the woman</i>
<i>I hate more than anyone else in the world.</i>

51
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,489
Good morning!

52
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,285
Mrs. Tsuji was quite something, huh?

53
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,037
She was a personality.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,705
Good job today.

55
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,249
Hello.

56
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,669
Kodaira, you don't like sweets?

57
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:18,716
Oh, no, homemade stuff from strangers
is kind of a visceral no-go for me.

58
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,551
I see.

59
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:26,474
Hey, Ms. Misono and Mrs. Tsuji
used to be friends, you know.

60
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,433
What?

61
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,229
I wonder what went wrong between them.

62
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,940
Human relationships are scary.

63
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,235
A single wrong step can ruin everything.

64
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,945
She had friends…

65
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,865
<i>I have to make sure</i>
<i>not to mess this one up either.</i>

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,368
…I really can't picture it.

67
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,998
It's right after work,
so I shouldn't overdo it either.

68
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,333
Which means…

69
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,420
It's so grown-up and boring.

70
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>Friday is fine.</i>

71
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:09,642
"Where is your workplace?"

72
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,770
<i>In Gotanda.</i>

73
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,357
"Then let's find somewhere in Gotanda?"

74
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,612
<i>Okay. I'll wait in front of the station.</i>

75
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,616
He's so formal.

76
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,622
<i>It was a spur of the moment invitation.</i>
<i>What if he didn't want to go?</i>

77
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,125
What do I do?

78
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,669
What if he's not into it?

79
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,681
Oh, and the restaurant.

80
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,809
I don't know what kind of food he likes.

81
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,519
GOTANDA ITALIAN

82
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,106
Huh, there's this many Italian places?

83
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,284
Should I drop by the hairdresser?

84
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,913
No, lipstick is more important.

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,664
No.

86
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,125
Actually…

87
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,857
<i>If it's just the two of us,</i>
<i>there's a chance of it happening…</i>

88
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,705
<i>What do I do?</i>

89
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,583
<i>It's turning into quite a hassle.</i>

90
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,385
What's wrong?

91
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,720
Nothing.

92
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,891
You and Ms. Misono
joined at the same time?

93
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,143
We did.

94
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,896
Miyuki has always worked hard.

95
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,443
She's still the center of the company.
Just like she used to be.

96
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,778
<i>Who is she calling a center?</i>

97
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,072
<i>You're just mocking me.</i>

98
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,409
<i>Retiring upon marriage is so outdated.</i>

99
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,578
<i>She always picked the easy way out.</i>

100
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,415
Hey, how about we go camping soon?

101
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,584
-Camping?
-Yes.

102
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,714
We should get out and relax in nature.
It's really cool, actually.

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,301
Have a look at this.

104
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,137
Listen. That's just not happening.

105
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:57,768
My job doesn't give me as much time off
as your little laid-back editor job.

106
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,688
I'm not saying to go right now.

107
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,232
We'll go when you job calms down a little.

108
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,111
That's what I just said, I can't just
take a long vacation like that.

109
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,905
Nor do I want to.

110
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:16,204
If I took careless leaves
like those young people do,

111
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,123
then a promotion isn't happening either.

112
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,921
You know, to begin with,

113
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:30,760
the reason I work so hard is because
I'm thinking about our future together.

114
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,472
If we were to get married,
I'd have to work the hardest.

115
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:40,228
You only make half of what I do.
If you don't even get--

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,485
I see.

117
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,155
You're right.

118
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:53,991
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,913
GOTANDA

120
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>Why do I feel so uncomfortable?</i>

121
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,716
<i>It's the same feeling as when</i>
<i>I'm not in the mood for a drinking party.</i>

122
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,680
<i>I need someone to tell me</i>
<i>the name of this phenomenon.</i>

123
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,566
<i>No way,</i>
<i>how long has he been standing there?</i>

124
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,003
Kagiya. I didn't know
you were waiting over here.

125
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,339
I'm sorry for looking so shabby.

126
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,174
No, not at all.

127
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,220
Let's go?

128
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,471
Yes.

129
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,064
I'm sorry, we're full right now.

130
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,947
Do you have a reservation?

131
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,745
Oh, I'm afraid the waiting time
right now is around one hour…

132
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,750
Nothing is available.

133
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,918
It's Friday after all.

134
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,548
Um…

135
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:41,390
Is there a place around here
that you like to go to?

136
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,726
A place I like to go to?

137
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,786
<i>I can't believe we're having ramen.</i>

138
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,751
<i>I should have reserved a table somewhere.</i>

139
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,092
By the way, how old are you?

140
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,677
I'm 29.

141
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,722
What? You're so young.

142
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,519
I'm 32 years old.

143
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,689
Huh? You're older than me?

144
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,024
What?

145
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,654
I can never tell a woman's age.

146
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,163
I've been wondering for a while,

147
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,208
but do you wear the mask
because of your job?

148
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,503
No, I have hay fever.

149
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,796
Hay fever?

150
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,339
Yes.

151
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,008
Do you have it too?

152
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,969
No, not at all.

153
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,721
My brother
suffers pretty bad from it, though.

154
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
He keeps his nose like…

155
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,518
He'd crunch this
up into his nose like this.

156
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,940
<i>This feels nice.</i>

157
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>Much more relaxed than before.</i>

158
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,030
The ramen was good, huh?

159
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,867
We should have ordered some gyoza too.

160
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,579
Oh, right.

161
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,957
Kagiya, your first name is "Senri", right?

162
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,002
-Huh?
-I saw it on your business card.

163
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,424
You're right.
I'm surprised you remembered.

164
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,178
I thought it was a pretty name.

165
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,311
Was that a weird thing to say?

166
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,107
No, it's fine.

167
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,569
I'm just feeling a little embarrassed.

168
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,405
<i>T-That's so cute.</i>

169
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,168
I had fun today.

170
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,587
Thank you.

171
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,797
Um.

172
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,601
-I want to talk more.
-If you want to, we…

173
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,190
Ah, no…

174
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,735
I mean, uh…

175
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,987
Another time…

176
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,705
Now is fine too.

177
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,794
You could come to my place if you want.

178
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,007
Welcome.

179
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,766
Do you drink alcohol?

180
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,313
A <i>shochu</i> highball then, please.

181
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,816
Okay.

182
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,821
There's only alcohol-free here.

183
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,201
I'll go look at the snacks.

184
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,828
Okay.

185
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,966
<i>Not once since I started living alone</i>
<i>have I had a man come over.</i>

186
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,014
<i>I went to a women's college,</i>

187
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,643
<i>and never had any romances at work either.</i>

188
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,357
<i>I had a few crushes now and then,</i>

189
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,861
<i>but either they were in relationship,</i>

190
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,072
<i>or they were married.</i>

191
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:15,998
<i>So today, Kagiya will be the first man</i>
<i>I've ever invited over.</i>

192
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,673
Are you married
or do you have a girlfriend?

193
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,133
Huh?

194
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,597
No. Neither of those.

195
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,016
Thank goodness.

196
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,851
Me too.

197
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,943
Cheers.

198
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,700
It's so good.

199
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,208
Make yourself comfortable, okay?

200
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,127
You can use this.

201
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,129
Thank you.

202
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,216
I've never been in a woman's home before.

203
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,677
I'm a little nervous.

204
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,971
Oh, really?

205
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,939
Do you often have men over?

206
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,316
Here?

207
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,612
This is the first time.

208
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,533
So I'm nervous too.

209
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,744
No one has come over?

210
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,789
A boyfriend, maybe.

211
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,708
Never.

212
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,672
I had a boyfriend in high school,
but that's about it.

213
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,759
I would've never guessed.

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,097
I'm not sure that's a good thing.

215
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,560
Well, I mean, you're…

216
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,896
P-Pretty.

217
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,236
Oh, no. I'm not really.

218
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,366
You seem like
you can get along with anyone.

219
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,036
That's not true.

220
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:23,751
So I was really happy when you said
you wanted to talk to me more.

221
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,095
Let's have some of these.

222
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,025
<i>I want to touch him.</i>

223
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,986
<i>Right now,</i>

224
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,697
<i>that's all.</i>

225
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,804
I missed.

226
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,306
I'm sorry.

227
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,183
I'm terrible at this.

228
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,682
Guess they're having a home party too.

229
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,309
Seems like it.

230
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,857
They're a little loud.

231
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,862
<i>Another remarkable achievement.</i>

232
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,822
<i>Shogi player Shinta Fujimoto</i>

233
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,993
<i>got a historic 29th consecutive victory</i>

234
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,246
<i>in the opening match</i>
<i>of the Osho Title Tournament League.</i>

235
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,958
<i>Shinta Fujimoto</i>
<i>back in January of this year…</i>

236
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,418
Kagiya?

237
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,502
I'm sorry.

238
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,671
Wait, Kagiya!

239
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,340
I'm home.

240
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,562
Makoto?

241
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,743
<i>Where did I do wrong?</i>

242
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>If I knew I'd feel this way, it would have</i>
<i>been easier to stay alone forever.</i>

243
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>It was so fun being together.</i>

244
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,128
If you want him back,
you need to go to him first.

245
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,130
<i>I'm sorry. I want to see you.</i>

246
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,840
<i>I need to talk to him again.</i>

247
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,884
<i>I don't want it to end yet.</i>
