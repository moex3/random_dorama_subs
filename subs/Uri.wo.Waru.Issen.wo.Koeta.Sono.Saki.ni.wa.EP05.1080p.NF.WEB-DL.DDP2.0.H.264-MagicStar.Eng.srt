1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,051
Good morning!

2
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,723
Here are your medical check-up notices.

3
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,435
Thank you.

4
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,228
It's that time of year again.

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,732
I was flagged during
last year's breast cancer screening.

6
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,108
You were?

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,195
They checked it again
and it turned out to be nothing.

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,698
Let's hope there's no
abnormalities this year.

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,074
Right.

10
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,911
<i>My love life is abnormal enough.</i>

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,540
He keeps his nose like…

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>It was so fun being together.</i>

13
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,632
<i>But because I made</i>
<i>a move on him too quickly…</i>

14
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,760
Kagiya?

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,303
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,305
Wait, Kagiya!

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>Because I was too aggressive,</i>

18
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,561
<i>he must have been put him off.</i>

19
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:15,158
WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON?
CALL ME, PLEASE PICK UP, LET'S TALK

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,203
<i>You know, to begin with,</i>

21
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:23,083
the reason I work so hard is because
I'm thinking about our future together.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,669
If we were to get married,
I'd have to work the hardest.

23
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:31,257
You only make half of what I do.
If you don't even get--

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,260
Makoto?

25
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,100
<i>I was being a bit too harsh, but still…</i>

26
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,477
Miyuki.

27
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,895
What?

28
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,481
Here. It's the medical check-up notice.

29
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,274
Thanks.

30
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,363
You look pale. Are you okay?

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,284
If that's all, just go.
Even if you aren't, some of us are busy.

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,040
What?

33
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,960
Why are you always so irritable?

34
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,632
I know we weren't on good terms
when I quit before,

35
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,260
but that was 13 years ago.

36
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,679
Are you that obsessed with me?

37
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,763
Excuse me?

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,725
I don't actually
care about you whatsoever.

39
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,063
I see.

40
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,775
Then don't make that face at me.

41
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,069
You look scary.

42
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,116
What do you mean, scary?

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,041
<i>Like a monster.</i>

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,674
Try thinking about it
with the genders reversed, please.

45
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,718
If it had been a man inviting her home,

46
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,387
and he suddenly took her hand
and tried to kiss her.

47
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,474
<i>Anyone would pull back. It's creepy.</i>

48
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,810
<i>Guess I was creepy.</i>

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,812
<i>But if he wasn't interested at all,</i>

50
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,482
<i>wouldn't he have declined</i>
<i>the invitation to come over?</i>

51
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,192
<i>That's true.</i>

52
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,445
<i>That doesn't mean he consented to it.</i>

53
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>Some people don't want sexual intimacy.</i>

54
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,160
<i>Could it be Kagiya is also asexual?</i>

55
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
<i>He doesn't look like it.</i>

56
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,707
<i>Though neither does Hara.</i>

57
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,503
<i>I can't figure this out.</i>

58
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,090
<i>If you can't figure it out,</i>
<i>you're simply going to have to ask them.</i>

59
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,431
THE OTHER DAY

60
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,601
<i>I can't.</i>

61
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,565
Give me a break!

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,073
I forgot about that.

63
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,499
HEALTH CHECKUP QUESTIONNAIRE

64
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,628
<i>"Have you engaged in sexual activities?"</i>

65
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,214
<i>That one again…</i>

66
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,638
<i>Every year, I have to publicly</i>
<i>document that I've never had sex.</i>

67
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,808
<i>The embarrassment,</i>
<i>emptiness and misery it brings</i>…

68
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,310
HAVE YOU ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITIES?

69
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,353
NO

70
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,981
<i>If I had experience,</i>

71
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,402
<i>would things have gone better with Kagiya?</i>

72
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,785
MARRIED - UNMARRIED

73
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,870
UNMARRIED

74
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:34,542
<i>I was too focused on</i>
<i>making sure I could support myself.</i>

75
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,046
<i>My family is poor</i>

76
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,841
<i>so I was studying and working</i>
<i>when everyone else was having fun.</i>

77
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,178
<i>Even after getting a full-time job</i>

78
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:49,182
<i>I made sure to learn the job</i>
<i>so I could make money quickly.</i>

79
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,436
<i>I can always get married anytime.</i>

80
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,063
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

81
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:02,070
<i>If I knew I'd feel this way, it would have</i>
<i>been easier to stay alone forever.</i>

82
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,742
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,245
It's not like you're new at this,

84
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,541
so how could you not
double-check before adding the photo?

85
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,377
I'm terribly sorry.

86
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,420
Ms. Kosaka.

87
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,090
You're making a lot of mistakes lately.

88
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,052
I've been spending all my time
fixing your messes.

89
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:30,264
Well now, everyone makes mistakes.

90
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,519
Ms. Kosaka might have had
a lot going on in her personal life.

91
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,854
That's not an excuse.

92
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,193
Everyone has their issues,
but we all work hard.

93
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,697
If your personal life is that important,
then just get married and quit already.

94
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,411
Some of us are
too busy to just lounge around.

95
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,913
Hurry up and fix it.

96
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,082
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,420
It wasn't anything to get that mad about.

98
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,299
<i>I'm becoming a monster again.</i>

99
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,593
Let's be careful.

100
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,647
Y-MARKET: STORE WIDE SALE EVENT

101
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,367
WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON?

102
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,620
I'LL WAIT, TODAY IS YAKISOBA

103
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,539
<i>I never replied.</i>

104
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,545
<i>I wonder when Makoto's kindness</i>
<i>became something I took for granted.</i>

105
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>Even though</i>
<i>I was only able to work so hard</i>

106
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,509
<i>because he was there for me.</i>

107
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,140
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>What if he never comes back?</i>

108
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,064
That hurt.

109
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,115
Miyuki?

110
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,705
Are you okay?

111
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,500
Tsuji…

112
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,506
There you go.

113
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,134
Thanks.

114
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,180
I live close around here too.

115
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,973
What?

116
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,478
I've seen you going home a few times,
but I couldn't approach you.

117
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,939
You always looked so scary.

118
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,986
Why were you crying?

119
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,739
I-I wasn't crying.

120
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,782
Huh?

121
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,659
Huh?

122
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
I'm certain you were crying.

123
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,332
Right. You probably had a stomach ache.

124
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,209
Of course that's not it.

125
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,465
My boyfriend left.

126
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,134
Huh? What?

127
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,681
What? Wait a minute, you have a boyfriend?

128
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,808
Hurry up, tell me, what is he like?

129
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,978
Is he handsome? Or cute?
Or like a teddy bear?

130
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,105
You take me for a fool, don't you?

131
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,481
What?

132
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,737
All I do is work
and then my boyfriend ditches me too.

133
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,703
You're married and got it all figured out,
so you enjoy looking down on me.

134
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,250
You only think so because
you're the one taking me for a fool.

135
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,127
What?

136
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,923
The reason I got married and left
was because I could never be like you.

137
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,385
I knew, no matter how hard I tried

138
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,097
I would never be
important to them like you are.

139
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,392
So I figured I'd make a family instead.

140
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,937
But…

141
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,691
It's not easy to
become important to someone.

142
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,445
I think my husband is cheating,

143
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,616
and my son is
in his rebellious, hateful phase.

144
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,996
No matter how elaborate the food
I cook is, no one ever says anything.

145
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm so tired of it.

146
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,511
I don't know why
I can tell you all of this.

147
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,724
I couldn't even tell my friends or family.

148
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,354
You know,

149
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,025
the period we spent as friends
was the most fun I've ever had.

150
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,652
Huh?

151
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:58,074
That's why I talked to you
even though I know you hate me.

152
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,589
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,428
I misunderstood you.

154
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,599
What's that? You're being so honest.

155
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,227
I…

156
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,566
Never even considered
how you actually felt.

157
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,821
I became more and more stubborn,

158
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,241
and I was angry all the time.

159
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,705
It's no wonder
someone like me ends up alone.

160
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,001
Did you try going to his workplace?

161
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,378
What?

162
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,048
If you want him back,
you need to go to him first.

163
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,551
But…

164
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,930
I said something horrible to him.

165
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,603
Even if you were in the wrong,
you can choose to mend a relationship.

166
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,731
Just like we're doing.

167
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,868
It's rare for Ms. Misono
to take a day off.

168
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,327
It is.

169
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,204
Maybe she went on a trip somewhere.

170
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,330
Who knows.

171
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,833
Ms. Kosaka.

172
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,044
-Ms. Misono is calling you. Line Three.
-Okay.

173
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,130
Speak of the devil.

174
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,384
Yes.

175
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,552
Hello.

176
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,432
Sorry, did I mention that the draft
about the internship was due today?

177
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,142
Uh, yes.

178
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,352
It's being proofread at the moment.

179
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,353
<i>Thanks.</i>

180
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,065
I'm sorry for suddenly taking a day off.

181
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,650
<i>Not at all.</i>

182
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:02,239
Despite telling others to quit
over their personal life, here I am.

183
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
But…

184
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,705
I've learned that
a mistake doesn't mean it's the end.

185
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,381
I'm sorry for being so mean to you.

186
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,259
I know I'm bothersome,

187
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:23,969
<i>but thank you.</i>

188
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,430
Oh. Sure.

189
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,390
Goodbye.

190
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:42,696
Makoto took a leave of absence
and went to Shizuoka.

191
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,989
Shizuoka?

192
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:44,907
Yes.

193
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,785
He said he was going camping or something.

194
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,414
Hey, how about we go camping soon?

195
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,542
-Camping?
-Yes.

196
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,419
We should get out and relax in nature.

197
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,589
Have a look at this.

198
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:18,524
<i>Makoto was inviting me to come</i>
<i>with him to unwind in a place like this.</i>

199
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,871
<i>The person you are calling is not avail--</i>

200
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,907
Makoto…

201
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,495
Makoto.

202
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,749
Makoto!

203
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,168
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

204
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>I want to see you.</i>

205
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,390
Makoto!

206
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,935
Miyuki?

207
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,192
Makoto.

208
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
Why are you here?

209
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,448
I wanted to apologize.

210
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,079
I've been awful to you all this time.

211
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,997
I'm sorry!

212
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,254
I…

213
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,843
Wanted to be alone for a bit
and needed a change of scenery.

214
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,849
I thought it might be okay to
break up with you and be on my own.

215
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:22,523
Honestly, your words really hurt me.

216
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,402
I'm so sorry.

217
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,950
I've been putting down everyone around me.

218
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,578
I've been like a monster.

219
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,331
A monster?

220
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,837
I was taking your kindness for granted.

221
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,214
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,431
If you liked me enough to
chase me all the way out here,

223
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,017
I wish you'd have told me.

224
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,853
Makoto.

225
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,646
Hmm?

226
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,732
I…

227
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,570
want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

228
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,825
When you disappeared,

229
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,997
I realized you're
the one I treasure the most.

230
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,040
So…

231
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,673
Will you please come back to me?

232
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,095
I promise

233
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,682
I won't be a monster again.

234
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,278
It's okay if you do.

235
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,781
Huh?

236
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,786
Not every day is all fun and games,

237
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,622
so you just have to make sure
you become human again after.

238
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,709
Makoto…

239
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,423
Apparently you can
go river rafting here in summer.

240
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,133
Let's go together next year.

241
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,346
Yeah.

242
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,246
-Apparently their pasta is really good.
-Really?

243
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,708
It's hard to get a reservation.

244
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,425
<i>I've learned that</i>
<i>a mistake doesn't mean it's the end.</i>

245
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,372
<i>I don't want it to end yet.</i>

246
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,875
<i>I need to talk to him again.</i>

247
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,596
SHINTA FUJIMOTO YOUNGEST EVER
TO COMPETE IN THE OSHO TITLE MATCH

248
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,348
MAIKO KOSAKA
INCOMING CALL

249
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,160
<i>He never called back</i>…

250
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,703
What's your type?

251
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,080
Someone who makes me smile.

252
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,791
<i>It was fun because he was there with me.</i>

253
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>Kosaka knows nothing about me.</i>

254
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,339
<i>Once you make a mistake,</i>
<i>you can't go back.</i>
