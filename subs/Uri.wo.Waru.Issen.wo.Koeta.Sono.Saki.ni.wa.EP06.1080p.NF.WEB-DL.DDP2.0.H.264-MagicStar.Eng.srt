00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,799
<i>Thirty-two years old. Virgin.</i>

2
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,221
<i>I have not had sex even once.</i>

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>If you don't mind…</i>

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,393
Could you do it with me?

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,646
Ouch!

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,564
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>This time…</i>

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,526
Kagiya.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>…I have to stop making mistakes.</i>

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,282
Would you like to go for dinner together?

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,868
Yes.

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,828
He keeps his nose like…

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,666
<i>It was so fun being together.</i>

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>If I had experience,</i>

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,799
<i>would things have gone better with Kagiya?</i>

16
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>But because I made</i>
<i>a move on him too quickly…</i>

17
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,184
Kagiya?

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,185
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,729
Wait, Kagiya!

20
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,106
<i>Because I was too aggressive,</i>

21
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,817
<i>he must have been put him off.</i>

22
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>I don't want it to end yet.</i>

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,786
<i>I need to talk to him again.</i>

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,631

MAIKO KOSAKA
INCOMING CALL

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,377
<i>He never called back</i>…

27
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,471
KAGIYA I CALLED YOU YESTERDAY

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>What if he ignores my texts too?</i>

29
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,152
<i>That would definitely mean the end.</i>

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,195
<i>There's no coming back from that.</i>

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,573
Oh, you're from Eikou.

32
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,533
Are you here for maintenance?

33
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,742
<i>Kagiya?</i>

34
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,120
-No, not maintenance.
-Oh, I see.

35
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,205
What brings you here then?

36
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,416
To deliver toner.

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,667
<i>It's not him.</i>

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,210
Thank you.

39
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:53,172
<i>Maybe he doesn't want to see me</i>
<i>so he asked for a transfer.</i>

40
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,966
<i>Or what?</i>

41
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,885
Thank you.

42
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>Did he already end things?</i>

43
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>Kosaka knows nothing about me.</i>

44

48
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,704
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,080
Wait--

50
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,000
<i>In 1958…</i>

51

00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,137
Check.

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,765
I give up.

54
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,683
That's a good move.

55
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,685
Well played.

56
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,938
Kagiya, you're good at this.

57
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,913
I resign.

58
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,382
<i>Someone like me</i>

59

60
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,374
Wow!

61
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,918
That looks so good on you, Miyuki.

62
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,462
I know.

63
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,629
Oh, please.

64
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,965
Well, it actually suits you, so it's fine.

<i>How nice…</i>

68
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,645
<i>I should also stop overthinking</i>
<i>and get back to work.</i>

69
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,108
Um, Ms. Misono?

70
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,903
Is there anything I can help with?

71
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,154
What?

72
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,197
Really?

73
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,950
Take care of this, then.

74
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,704
Sorry for making you help.

75
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,499
No, that's what I'm here for as a temp.

76
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,504
Shall we get started then?

77
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,463
Yes.

78
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,967
Huh, is it an employee interview?

79
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,931
Ah, this person is from Musashi-Koyama.
Same as me.

80
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,309
Kosaka, do you live alone?

81
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,019
Uh, yeah.

82
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,939
Being independent is so cool.

83
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,567
I'm still living
at my parents' house at 26.

84
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,489
But you live in Musashi-Koyama, right?
I'm jealous.

85
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,992
No, I'm just mooching off my parents.

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>She definitely</i>
<i>qualifies as the pretty type.</i>

87
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,960
<i>I bet she's popular,</i>

88
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,922
<i>and she probably has</i>
<i>a fairly handsome, high-caliber boyfriend.</i>

89
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,424
Let's divide it into paragraphs
to avoid mistakes.

90
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,551
Yes.

91
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>They say lookism isn't good,</i>

92
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>but usually handsome guys</i>
<i>choose beautiful women,</i>

93
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,642
<i>and beautiful women choose handsome guys.</i>

94
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,813
<i>So I figured someone as ugly as me</i>
<i>would never get chosen.</i>

95
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,316
<i>But then I tried a casual app…</i>

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,234
IT'S A MATCH!

97
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,193
IT'S A MATCH!

98
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,404
IT'S A MATCH!

99
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,283
Well, it didn't
continue after that, though.

100
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,784
What?

101
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,037
Ah, no, it's nothing.

102
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,625
Ah, this part needs
a prolonged sound mark, right?

103
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,711
Ah, yeah, I guess.

104
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,422
-Okay, let me fix it.
-Alright, thanks.

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,100
Hey.

106
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,602
Hello.

107
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,065
<i>Except for Keita.</i>

108
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,527
<i>He's the only one</i>
<i>who wanted to meet again.</i>

109
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,404
It's not raining.

110
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,824
The forecast said rain.

111
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,120
<i>Could it be that he likes me?</i>

112
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,087
Hmm? What?

113
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,926
Oh! D.Pool!

114
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,053
I wanted it after we talked about it.

115
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,056
How nice. It's such an emotional album.

116
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,517
The second track is amazing, right?

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,645
The one that starts with the piano?
That one is so good.

118
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,814
I thought you'd say that, Ms. Ren.

119
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,401
You can call me "Ren."

120
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,737
You're a year older than me after all.

121
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,115
Ah… then, Ren it is.

122
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,325
Yeah.

123
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,203
<i>I'm having fun, but…</i>

124
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,665
<i>He's ugly.</i>

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,879
<i>I guess he's also only seeing me</i>
<i>because he can't find anyone else.</i>

126
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,005
Um…

127
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,764
My nails are a mess.

128
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,226
<i>Maybe I should find a hobby.</i>

129
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,689
<i>Then maybe I can forget about Kagiya.</i>

167
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,227
Someone who's fun to be with.

168
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,564
I want someone who makes me smile.

169
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,026
What about you?

170
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,236
Someone handsome.

171
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,779
That was fast.

172
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,660
PRINT

173
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,305
Here, the key to the storage room.

174
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,307
T-Thank you.

175
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,934
I'll leave the rest to you.

176
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,111
Hello.

177
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,073
Hello.

178
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,625
This… Right?

179
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
Yes.

180
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,767
I thought maybe you had been transferred.

181
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,652
<i>It's no good.</i>
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>

182
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,079
Kosaka. I finished.

183
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,665
Thank you, you were a great help.

184
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,834
Then, I'll go ahead…

185
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,378
Sorry, I'll leave first.

186
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,589
Hmm?

187
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,547
<i>She looked sad.</i>

188
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,942
<i>That's Pac-Man, right?</i>

189
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,029
I can't get past level eight.

190
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,990
I got to 21.

191
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,283
Wow, really?

192
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,579
Can I come with you?

193
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,747
What?

194
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,422
Wow! It's really Pac-Man!

195
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,048
You're so good at it!

196
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,973
It's so good.

197
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,780
<i>What am I doing?</i>

198
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>Involving her in my own issues…</i>

199
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,592
<i>I hoped to run into him somewhere.</i>

200
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,971
<i>But then when we finally did meet…</i>

201
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,891
<i>It was hopeless.</i>

202
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,940
<i>Once you make a mistake,</i>
<i>you can't go back.</i>

203
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,118
<i>I guess Kagiya and I…</i>

204
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
Kosaka!

205
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,885
Kagiya?

206
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,517
What happened?

207
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm sorry.

208
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,245
I'm weirding you out, aren't I?

209
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,832
I'll go home.

210
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,877
Wait, please.

211
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,470
I'm sorry about the other day.

212
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,268
Huh?

213
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,813
For coming on so strong.

214
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,983
It must have grossed you out.

215
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,487
I'm truly sorry.

216
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,782
No,

217
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,243
not at all.

218
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,745
Huh?

219
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,460
It's my fault.

220
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,466
That was…

221
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,220
my problem.

222
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,515
"My problem"?

223
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,455
I'll tell you everything.

224
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,541
<i>I haven't moved forward at all since.</i>

225
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>Even if it's fun, if he's not handsome</i>…

226
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,379
<i>They're probably wondering</i>
<i>why he's with someone as ugly as me.</i>

227
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,548
<i>I don't want to let go yet either.</i>

228
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,884
<i>I want to do more with him.</i>
