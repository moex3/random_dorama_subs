1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,060
Kosaka!

2
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,235
Kagiya?

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,742
What happened?

4
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,288
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,708
I'll go home.

6
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,544
Wait, please.

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,886
I'm sorry about the other day.

8
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,015
Huh?

9
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,102
For coming on so strong.

10
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,147
It must have grossed you out.

11
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,358
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,736
Wait, Kagiya!

13
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,905
No,

14
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,282
not at all.

15
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,493
Huh?

16
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,287
That was…

17
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,208
my problem.

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,628
"My problem"?

19
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,765
You're soaking wet.

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,435
Maybe it's better if we go somewhere else.

21
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,688
Okay.

22
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,367
If you don't mind,

23
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,370
we can go to my place.

24
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>That was my problem.</i>

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>What kind of problem does he have?</i>

26
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,766
<i>Is he asexual?</i>

27
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,021
<i>He doesn't like women that way?</i>

28
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>Or am I the problem?</i>

29
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:21,242
<i>For now, he ran through</i>
<i>the pouring rain to follow me,</i>

30
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,454
<i>so I should hear him out.</i>

31
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,887
Thank you.

32
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,556
For the clothes too.

33
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,517
Don't worry about it.

34
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,354
They're a bit small, aren't they?
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,649
It's fine.

36
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,650
Right.

37
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,612
I'm making tea, so please take a seat.

38
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,323
Okay.

39
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,592
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

40
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,224
Honestly, I…

41
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,185
thought you hated me now.

42
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,897
So just the fact that you're here…

43
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,942
I'll tell you.

44
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,694
Huh?

45
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,994
I'll tell you everything.

46
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,416
Okay.

47
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,223
Sho…

48
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,768
Shogi.

49
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,563
Shogi?

50
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,237
Have you ever tried playing it?

51
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,786
I tried that one game. Where
you pile the tiles up and slide them.

52
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,875
I've…

53
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,379
Played shogi since I was seven years old.

54
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,883
Since you were seven?

55
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,135
Yes.

56
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,641
It started out as
something I did to pass time.

57
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,198
<i>When I was playing,</i>

58
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,035
<i>I'd be so focused,</i>
<i>I'd forget about everything else.</i>

59
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,039
Check.

60
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,416
I give up.

61
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,585
That's a good move.

62
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,295
Well played.

63
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,964
It was fun.

64
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,717
So…

65
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,431
I joined a training facility,
and aimed at becoming a pro player.

66
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,312
You mean professionally?

67
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,648
Yes.

68
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,862
I couldn't imagine myself
doing anything else.

69
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,616
But…

70
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,373
If I couldn't go pro before I turned 26,
I would have to quit.

71
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,416
Those are the rules.

72
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,139
I resign.

73
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,684
<i>And…</i>

74
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,562
I was unable to do so.

75
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,153
Even if you dreams don't come true,

76
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,281
you still have to live on.

77
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:39,292
All I had ever done was play shogi,
so I had no idea what to do with myself.

78
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,213
I just…

79
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,302
searched for a job requiring only
a high school diploma and no experience.

80
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,889
I moved out,

81
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,435
and told myself to go on with life
without thinking about shogi.

82
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,395
But…

83
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,485
When I was here last time…

84
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,029
<i>Another remarkable achievement.</i>

85
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,031
<i>Shogi player Shinta Fujimoto</i>

86
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,951
<i>got a historic 29th consecutive victory</i>
<i>by defeating Motojima Akio</i>

87
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,371
<i>in the opening match</i>
<i>of the Osho Title Tournament League.</i>

88
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>Shinta Fujimoto</i>
<i>back in January of this year…</i>

89
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,669
Kagiya?

90
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,421
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,219
<i>It had already been three years,</i>

92
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,598
I didn't know
it would still hurt this badly.

93
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:45,566
I haven't moved forward at all since.

94
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,199
When I realized,
I was disgusted with myself.

95
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,668
So, when you called me…

96
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,504
<i>I just couldn't pick up.</i>

97
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,306
I am really sorry.

98
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,934
Don't be.

99
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,441
You did nothing wrong.

100
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,863
It's me.

101
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,492
I was just running away.

102
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,047
Huh?

103
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,386
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,307
Why?

105
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,894
Because

106
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,564
you seem so sad.

107
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,613
<i>Crying</i>…

108
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,742
<i>doesn't change anything.</i>

109
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,621
<i>Painful things,</i>

110
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,291
<i>are best just tucked away.</i>

111
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,795
-Thank you for speaking to us.
-My pleasure.

112
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,425
First of all, congratulations on winning
the Tsume Shogi Championship.

113
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,885
Thank you.

114
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,220
What is your next goal?

115
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,223
-I want to go pro…
-Yes?

116
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,060
I hope to eventually reach
the Eight-Dan rank.

117
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,020
That's exciting.

118
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,441
But don't you think you'll become
the youngest player in history to go pro?

119
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,235
I will do my best. Thank you.

120
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,407
<i>I thought I would be fine</i>
<i>if I just ignored the game.</i>

121
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>But I…</i>

122
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>I</i>…

123
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,975
<i>was so sad.</i>

124
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,233
<i>I was sad.</i>

125
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,947
<i>I wanted to cry.</i>

126
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,227
-Do you want a sip?
-Yeah. I'll try.

127
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,814
What's your type?

128
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,816
Someone who's fun to be with.

129
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,945
I want someone who makes me smile.

130
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,409
<i>It is fun some of the time, but…</i>

131
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,829
Hmm? What?

132
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh! D.Pool!

133
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:33,210
-It's such an emotional album.
-The second track is amazing, right?

134
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,672
The one that starts with the piano?
That one is so good.

135
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,301
<i>Even if it's fun, if he's not handsome</i>…

136
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,474
IT'S A MATCH!

137
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,143
HELLO I'M FREE TONIGHT
DO YOU WANT TO GRAB A DRINK?

138
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,352
Touya?

139
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,233
<i>I never expected him to swipe back.</i>

140
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,527
<i>Why is someone</i>
<i>so handsome interested in me?</i>

141
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,071
<i>Is it an MLM?</i>

142
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,574
<i>His bio looks normal though.</i>

143
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,622
<i>Guess it won't hurt to meet up.</i>

144
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,052
TOUYA
26, TOKYO

145
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:25,930
Ren?

146
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,185
Hi. I'm Touya.

147
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,313
H-Hello. I'm Ren.

148
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,857
Huh.

149
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,400
This is a cute café.

150
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,486
What did you order?

151
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,489
L-Lemonade.

152
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,573
That's nice.

153
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,825
What should I get?

154
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,495
Excuse me.

155
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,705
<i>No hotel right away.</i>

156
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,749
Look, isn't he handsome?

157
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,210
He's so good-looking.

158
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,213
<i>Of course everyone's looking.</i>

159
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,217
<i>They're probably wondering</i>
<i>why he's with someone as ugly as me.</i>

160
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,512
Are you okay?

161
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,806
Ah, I'm fine.

162
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,148
W-What?

163
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,861
I was just thinking, you're stylish.

164
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,905
Huh? Not at all.

165
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,574
Your earrings are pretty.

166
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,909
I don't think so.

167
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,952
Really?

168
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,537
I think they are.

169
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,790
<i>What's his deal?</i>

170
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,675
I probably have to make tea again.

171
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>I don't want to let go yet either.</i>

172
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,148
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,361
It's fine.

174
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,076
I thought I had to give up on this.

175
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,416
-It feels good.
-Huh?

176
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,169
Ah… I'm sorry.

177
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,172
I said that out loud.

178
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,719
Me too.

179
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,805
Huh?

180
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,143
I feel good too.

181
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,768
Thank you for treating me.

182
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,395
Thank you for keeping me company.

183
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,483
I have somewhere I need to go now…

184
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,861
Okay.

185
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,782
<i>I'm not good enough after all.</i>

186
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,741
Ren.

187
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,732
Can I text you?

188
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,026
Huh?

189
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,403
Give me your details.

190
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,448
Yeah. Uh…

191
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,577
This is my ID.

192
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,954
Thanks.

193
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,581
<i>He wants to see me again.</i>

194
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,625
Got it. Thanks.

195
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,584
Sure.

196
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,669
See you.

197
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,051
<i>Kissing…</i>

198
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,972
<i>feels this nice</i>…

199
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,230
<i>I want to</i>

200
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,275
<i>do more with him.</i>

201
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>I've never thought about anyone this much.</i>

202
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,208
<i>I want to call him.</i>

203
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,459
<i>Can I?</i>

204
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,628
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>go to a museum this weekend?</i>

205
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,839
<i>Kagiya's scent is so calming.</i>

206
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,798
Kosaka.

207
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,009
Don't you think
someone else would be better?
