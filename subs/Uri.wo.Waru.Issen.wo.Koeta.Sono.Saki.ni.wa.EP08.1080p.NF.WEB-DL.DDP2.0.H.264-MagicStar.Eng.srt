<i>Kagiya's scent is so calming.</i>

2
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,057
It tickles.

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,517
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>I'm no good at this.</i>

5
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,454
<i>My gosh…</i>

6
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,665
<i>It feels so nice.</i>

7
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,821
Kagiya, uh…

8
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,781
Do you have one…?

9
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,283
Huh?

10
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,091
Thank you for your purchase.

11
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,390
Hello.

12
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,229
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,525
A client is having some urgent problem.

14
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,195
Oh, I see. You got called in.

15
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,781
I'm really sorry.

16
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,033
At this timing…

17
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,786
No, please go.

18
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,914
You helped me before too.

19
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,584
That evening when the copy machine broke.

20
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,794
You were my savior then.

21
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,714
Kosaka…

22
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,303
I'll wash your clothes and return them.

23
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,848
No, you can just leave them.
They'll be annoying to carry.

24
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,182
But…

25
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,896
Then let's meet the day after tomorrow.

26
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,316
I should be
getting off work early that day.

27
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,151
We could have hotpot here.

28
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,279
Well, I'd need to buy a pot for it, but…

29
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,824
Uh, okay.

30
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,826
Well then…

31
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,459
Take care.

32
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,220
I'll be off.

33
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,815
ENERGY PARTNERS

34
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,941
<i>In short,</i>

35
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,653
Hara will be leaving us next month.

36
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:39,988
What?

37
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,782
Wait, what, since when?

38
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm sorry. It was sudden.

39
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,452
Too sudden…

40
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,123
<i>He's changing jobs?</i>
<i>To the largest company in the industry?</i>

41
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,542
I broke up with her.

42
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,004
I'm probably asexual.

43
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:00,591
<i>I guess he's had a lot</i>
<i>to think about since then.</i>

44
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,761
Excuse me for a bit.

45
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,683
I recommended you
to take over my position.

46
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,851
Huh?

47
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,855
You're good at what you do.
You should aim higher.

48
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,818
I will be back next week.

49
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,455
<i>I'm sure Kosaka</i>
<i>would like something like this.</i>

51
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,792
Thank you very much.

52
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,128
<i>I ended up just buying it.</i>

53
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,921
<i>I hope she'll like it.</i>

54
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,891
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

55
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>I will have to cancel tomorrow.</i>

56
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,564
<i>"I've been made leader of a new project…"</i>

57
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,528
THAT'S A SHAME

58
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,204
THAT'S A SHAME

59
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,544
THAT'S AMAZING DO YOUR BEST

<i>I need to work hard too.</i>

62
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,022
He's so handsome.

63
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,607
Do you think he's a model?

64
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,323
<i>Can you believe someone this handsome</i>
<i>wanted a second date with me?</i>

65
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,374
<i>Sorry for the sudden message.</i>
<i>I got tickets for an event at DOPE.</i>

66
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,625
<i>Want to go tonight?</i>

67
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,794
<i>Keita…</i>

68
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,882
<i>How dare he think</i>
<i>I'll come running as soon as he asks?</i>

69
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:10,346
<i>Sorry, I'm with someone so I can't.</i>
<i>I probably won't have time for a while.</i>

70
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,765
OKAY.

71
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,476
Hey, Ren.

72
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,479
Are you busy later?

73
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,731
No, not at all.

74
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,320
Come on.

75
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,532
Why did Hara leave me
with such a big project?

76
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,785
<i>I was supposed to be seeing</i>
<i>Kagiya tonight.</i>

77
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,496
<i>I want to call him.</i>

78
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,373
<i>Can I?</i>

79
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>I can, right?</i>

80
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,586
<i>We are dating after all.</i>

81
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,589
<i>No.</i>

82
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,507
<i>We aren't yet.</i>

83
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,345
<i>We haven't even had sex yet.</i>

84
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,560
<i>I wonder how many times</i>
<i>I've re-read these.</i>

85
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,563
<i>My conversations with Kosaka.</i>

86
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,986
<i>I've never thought about anyone this much.</i>

87
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,072
<i>I'm happy but</i>…

88
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:15,077
<i>I feel worried because</i>
<i>I have no confidence in myself.</i>

89

<i>I can't help</i>

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,170
<i>but find it hard to believe</i>
<i>that she would stay with someone like me.</i>

91
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,090
<i>But I</i>…

92
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,886

Okay, done for today.

95
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,195
Huh? Kagiya?

96
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,615
Hello.

97
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,536
Kosaka. Is now a good time?

98
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,247
<i>Sure.</i>

99
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,623
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

100
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,208
Umm…

101
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,796
Do you want to
go to a museum this weekend?

102
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,507
Huh? A museum?

103
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,053
I was given tickets by
that client from the other night.

104
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,846
As a thank you.

105
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,098
That night?

106
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,268
Yes, I really want to go.

107
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,186
<i>I'll look at all the paintings.</i>

108
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,773
Okay.

109
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,483
Um.

110
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,318
This is the first time, isn't it?

111
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,237
That you ask me out.

112
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,739
Oh.

113
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,785
I'll invite you to
a lot more things from now on.

114
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,121
Okay.

115
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,335
<i>Yeah, it's fine.</i>

116
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>We haven't officially</i>
<i>asked each other out,</i>

117
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,632
<i>or had sex yet,</i>

118
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,050
<i>but I'm sure it's fine.</i>

119
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,431
Do you often go out around here?

120
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,766
That place just now was so pretty.

121
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,602
You think so? I'm glad.

122
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,355
<i>I could easily spend all night with Touya.</i>

123
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,942
Yo.

124
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,531
What? Are you kidding me?

125
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,660
Let's go, shall we?

126
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,913
That place lets us go in as three.

127
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,667
What?

128
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,252
Huh?

129
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,880
Have you never had a threesome before?

130
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,132
Hey.

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,927
Dude, are you blind?

132
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,512
I'm not. It's fine.

133
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,724
I never said anyone would do.

134
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,059
I can't believe you.

135
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,018
Then…

136
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,313
Ren, do you want to ask a friend to join?

137
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,773
Huh?

138
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,109
<i>What's up with her?</i>

139
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,903
<i>She isn't cute at all.</i>

140
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,490
<i>I figured it would be good</i>
<i>to mix it up every now and then.</i>

141
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,875
<i>Yes, of course that's what it was.</i>

142
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,835
<i>I knew that. I knew, but…</i>

143
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:19,261
<i>But I was hoping</i>
<i>it would be different this time.</i>

144
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,555
<i>Why?</i>

145
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,768
<i>Why does this happen to me</i>
<i>just because I'm not pretty?</i>

146
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,187
Ren!

147
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,404
<i>Oh no! Without thinking I…</i>

148
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,864
I'm glad.

149
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,033
Let's go together.

150
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,786
<i>I said I wasn't coming.</i>

151
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,664
<i>I acted so selfish</i>…

152
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,792
<i>So why is he still so nice?</i>

153
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
Hey.

154
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,254
Hmm?

155
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,260
Why do you want to keep seeing me?

156
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,471
Why are you so nice?

157
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,182
I'm ugly.

158
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,394
What happened?

159
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,440
Something awful.

160
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,903
You…

161
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,950
Always laugh at my stories.

162
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,079
It makes me so happy.

163
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,792
I can't talk to anyone else
about music like this,

164
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,337
so that's why I'm seeing you.

165
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,216
Because it's fun.

166
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,012
And you're cool.

167
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,849
Like the singer in D.Pool.

168
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,360
Thanks.

169
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,369
Let's go.

170
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,545
You're changing my assigned area?

171
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,463
Yes.

172
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,883
The conditions
on your new contract changed a bit.

173
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,719
I just figured out the ins and outs here.

174
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:27,973
I know, but it's
the condition of the new contract.

175
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,319
Alright, we're done!

176
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,993
Should we go tonight, then?

177
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,705
-To celebrate Kosaka's promotion.
-No, it's your farewell party.

178
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,627
-Of course!
-Thank you!

179
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,045
Ms. Misono, will you come too?

180
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,713
-Of course.
-I'm glad.

181
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,674
Oh, we're getting on.

182
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,883
Can we fit?

183
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>I really have nothing to offer.</i>

184
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,729
Kagiya.

185
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,861
Kosaka.

186
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,740
Huh?

187
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,535
Did something happen?

188
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,079
You seem down.

189
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,791
No.

190
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,597
That was wonderful. The use of colors.

191
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,599
Yes.

192
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,270
Art styles really change
with different eras.

193
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:03,819
It started out quite concrete,
but then became more abstract, didn't it?

194
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,032
We noticed the same things.

195
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,872
Do you like sweets?

196
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,665
Huh?

197
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,335
Oh. Yeah.

198
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,212
How about you?

199
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,174
Me too.

200
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,345
Are you a dog-person?

201
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,389
Good question.

202
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,354
I liked the stray cats that lived around
my parents' housing complex.

203
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
Then you're a cat-person.

204
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,153
I'm definitely a dog-person.

205
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,866
Though lately I find cats cute too.

206
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,287
Whereabouts do you live?

207
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,998
I live in Ota city.

208
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,671
Why all the questions all of a sudden?

209
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,383
I want to know more about you.

210
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,514
Because I didn't know anything until now.

211
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,767
Kosaka…

212
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,234
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,986
I wanted to pay.

214
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,821
Not at all.

215
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,615
You got the tickets for us.

216
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:37,037
UNPARALLELED SHOGI PLAYER FUJIMOTO
SNACKED ON THEM DURING THE GAME

217
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,545
How about we go over there?

218
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,463
Huh?

219
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,557
Oh.

220
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,979
It's okay.

221
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,565
I feel better than before.

222
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,945
I feel worse about making you worry.

223
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,410
Actually, Kosaka.

224
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,415
I'm being assigned
a different area at work.

225
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,250
What? Really?

226
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,334
Yes.

227
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,670
I see…

228
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,173
That's sad.

229
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,053
It's fine though, right?

230
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,804
I mean, you and I…

231
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,975
<i>… are dating, right?</i>

232
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,816
W-We can still see each other.

233
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,492
<i>Why is he not replying?</i>

234
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,160
Maiko!

235
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,205
Yuri.

236
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,249
Didn't expect to run into you here.

237
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
Same to you.

238
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,002
Are you shopping?

239
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,588
Yeah, my husband
is taking care of the kids.

240
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,466
Is this your boyfriend?

241
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,593
Huh?

242
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,265
Hello. I've known Maiko for a long time.

243
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,767
Hello.

244
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,060
You're wrong.

245
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,520
He's not my boyfriend.

246
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,901
<i>Stop, right now.</i>
<i>He's going to feel uncomfortable.</i>

247
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,114
Oh, I see. Sorry for bothering you.

248
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,949
See you.

249
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,334
I'm sorry. She's an old classmate.

250
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,464
She's always been like that.

251
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,055
Kagiya…

252
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,641
Something is wrong, right?

253
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,271
You don't seem happy today at all.

254
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,940
No, not at all.

255
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,738
Want to go look at the stores over there?

256
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,325
I wanted us to have
hotpot together soon, remember?

257
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,327
So I need to buy a pot.

258
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,502
Do you…

259
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,797
even have fun when you're with me?

260
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,884
Huh?

261
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,347
Don't you think
someone else would be better?

262
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,435
What are you talking about…

263
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,413
Please tell me how you feel.

264
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,373
Do you hate me?

265
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,043
<i>I was wrong. I should have told you.</i>

266
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,003
<i>I love you.</i>

267
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,214
<i>I love you too.</i>

268
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>I'm actually going to do it with Kagiya.</i>
