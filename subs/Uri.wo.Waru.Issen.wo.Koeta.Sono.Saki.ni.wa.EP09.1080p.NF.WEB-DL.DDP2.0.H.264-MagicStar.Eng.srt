1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>Why did I say something so awful?</i>

2
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,743
<i>Do you…</i>

3
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,786
even have fun when you're with me?

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,038
Huh?

5
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,499
Don't you think
someone else would be better?

6
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:52,218
First of all, congratulations on winning
the Tsume Shogi Championship.

7
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,470
Thank you.

8
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,974
<i>I haven't changed at all since then.</i>

9
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>I don't understand Kagiya's feelings.</i>

10
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,860
<i>Just when I thought</i>
<i>we were getting closer</i>…

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,490
Ah, so it's finally
heading towards divorce.

12
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,952
She was involved in an affair
not too long ago, right?

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,331
I saw that on the internet news too.

14
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,291
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

15
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,252
To think they swore love to each other,
only to end up divorcing.

16
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:31,007
Well, I think that's also a viable option.

17
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,675
Huh?

18
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,180
You know how you only
realize something after you've lost it?

19
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,100
If they were truly important to each
other they can always get back together.

20
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm in favor of divorce too.

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,647
You too?

22
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,898
Yes.

23
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,360
If they talk about it,
and still think it won't work,

24
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,612
maybe it's worth trying to let go.

25
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:57,158
Always trying to make things work.
It's impossible.

26
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:02,580
After all, swearing love
to each other is just for show.

27
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,957
For show…

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,501
You can't tell
from appearances whether or not

29
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,087
they really
see each other for who they are.

30
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:17,595
Seriously facing someone
isn't just about pretty words.

31
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,976
It's about accepting
that there will be scars.

32
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,022
<i>Did I truly face Kagiya?</i>

33
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>I may not understand Kagiya's feelings</i>
<i>but I also didn't properly convey my own.</i>

34
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,244
<i>I'll never get closer to him this way.</i>

35
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,831
EIKOU MAINTENANCE

36
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,132
Kosaka…

37
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,761
Can we talk for a moment?

38
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,727
I'm sorry for showing up
at your workplace like this.

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,687
It's okay.

40
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:18,197
I never know how to handle personal space.

41
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,785
I was scared people will dislike me,

42
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,247
so I decided to
not get too involved with others.

43
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,417
But…

44
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,005
I want you to know how I feel,

45
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,510
and I want to
understand your feelings better.

46
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,809
Please tell me how you feel.

47
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,441
Do you hate me?

48
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,868
I got the order wrong.

49
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,995
Huh?

50
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,208
I should've started out by telling you.

51
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,755
I…

52
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:22,595
Decided not to see you
until I became a full-time employee.

53
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,430
Full-time employee?

54
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,723
Yes.

55
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,643
At my workplace

56
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,355
you can't become a full-time employee
without a driver's license,

57
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,441
so I'm currently attending driving school.

58
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,152
For the past three years,

59
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,948
I kept thinking I was fine with nothing.

60
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,410
Since my dream didn't come true…

61
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:51,708
I thought the only thing that's left
was just to survive.

62
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,711
But…

63
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,923
After meeting you,

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,512
for the first time, I felt a desire.

65
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,597
Desire?

66
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,519
I want to become a person
you wouldn't be embarrassed to be with.

67
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,563
I want to change.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,901
I'm really sorry about the other day.

69
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,454
I was worried
that I might not be worthy of you,

70
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,539
and it made me anxious.

71
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,836
Kosaka.

72
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,757
Yes?

73
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,509
I…

74
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,429
love you.

75
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,725
So…

76
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,976
I mean…

77
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,730
It would be nice if…

78
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,317
You would…

79
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,195
Be my girlfriend.

80
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,658
I also…

81
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,244
I love you too.

82
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,627
It's the first time in my adult life
that I've liked someone this much.

83
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,284
I want to be spend more time
with you tonight.

84
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,125
Me too…

85
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,882
I'll make some tea.

86
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,510
Okay.

87
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,973
Or would you prefer something stronger?

88
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,534
<i>It's like we're magnets</i>
<i>drawn together this strongly.</i>

89
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>I'm actually going to do it.</i>

90
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,945
<i>With Kagiya…</i>

91
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,826
May I undress you?

92
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,872
Yes.

93
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,922
Is this okay too?

94
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,468
Can I turn off the light?

95
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,431
Ah… Yes.

96
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,343
<i>I'm sure he must have experience.</i>

97
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,599
Ouch.

98
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,979
I'm sorry, it hurts a little bit, I think.

99
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,024
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
It's fine.

101
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,279
It's…

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,531
My first time.

103
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,366
What?

104
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,077
<i>She's taken aback, isn't she?</i>

105
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,167
If I do something weird, please tell me.

106
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,379
No… It's my first time too.

107
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,340
What?

108
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,011
It's also my first time.

109
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,473
Really?

110
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,224
Yes.

111
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:48,981
I've always been embarrassed about it,
but if it's the same for you,

112
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,859
maybe it's a good thing.

113
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,864
I agree.

114
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,120
Um…

115
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,085
Can I touch you here?

116
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,587
Yes.

117
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,106
Um… be gentle.

118
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,234
Yes.

119
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,760
Give me a minute.

120
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,513
Okay.

121
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,951
<i>I</i>…

122
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,580
<i>don't know if I can do it.</i>

123
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,311
I put it on.

124
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,522
Okay.

125
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,986
Could you…

126
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,199
Spread your legs a bit more?

127
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,410
Yes.

128
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,797
Does it hurt?

129
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,841
It doesn't.

130
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,511
It's fine.

131
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,055
But…

132
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,683
Please don't stop.

133
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,543
I'm sorry.

134
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,294
Huh?

135
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,796
I…

136
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,340
I don't think I can do it.

137
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,844
I'm sorry too.

138
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,809
Maybe we should just stop for now.

139
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,772
Yes… That might be best.

140
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,826
<i>He must have felt uncomfortable.</i>

141
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,455
<i>Did I disappoint her?</i>

142
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,961
<i>Even though it feels good,</i>
<i>why does it hurt there?</i>

143
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,342
<i>I always mess up when it really matters.</i>

144
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,682
<i>When he said he liked me,</i>
<i>it made me so happy.</i>

145
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:57,980
<i>She said she liked me,</i>
<i>and wanted to do it with me…</i>

146
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,442
<i>I want to do it, but…</i>

147
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,632
Please don't force yourself.

148
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,679
I don't want you to feel pain.

149
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,848
I'm not forcing anything.

150
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,687
Even if it hurts,
I want to do it with you.

151
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,983
Because I love you.

152
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,372
<i>I was always so embarrassed</i>
<i>about having no experience.</i>

153
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,673
<i>Everyone else seems to be able to do it,</i>
<i>so why am I the only one who can't?</i>

154
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:57,725
<i>I wanted to be someone who had had sex,</i>
<i>and I even thought that anyone would do.</i>

155
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,942
<i>But now…</i>

156
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,825
Is it all in?

157
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,994
Yeah.

158
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,454
It's in.

159
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:30,466
<i>I'm glad my first time was with him.</i>

160
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,931
I love you.

161
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,434
Kosaka.

162
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,732
It's warm.

163
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,362
<i>What I always wanted was…</i>

164
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,118
<i>This.</i>

165
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,343
I'm kind of hungry.

166
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,266
Come to think of it,
we haven't had dinner, have we?

167
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,686
That's true.

168
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,607
Is it melon?

169
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,234
Yes.

170
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,611
A senior at work brought it for us.

171
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,163
It's good.

172
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>The word for losing one's virginity</i>

173
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,378
<i>is written with the characters</i>
<i>for "breaking a melon."</i>

174
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,381
<i>Breaking a hard melon…</i>

175
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,884
<i>I thought it sounded painful</i>
<i>and was a bit scared of it.</i>

176
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,680
<i>But now I understand.</i>

177
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,893
<i>Getting close to someone's heart</i>
<i>is a painful thing.</i>

178
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>But something more lies beyond the pain.</i>

179
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,960
Hey! That's dangerous.

180
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,091
Oh, man.

181
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,551
It's so good already.

182
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,311
-That didn't work out.
-So close.

183
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,062
DRIVER'S LICENSE

184
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,523
-Your turn next, Maiko.
-Yes.

185
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>That's why even though</i>
<i>I may be creating scars</i>

186
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,242
<i>I still want to keep moving forward.</i>
