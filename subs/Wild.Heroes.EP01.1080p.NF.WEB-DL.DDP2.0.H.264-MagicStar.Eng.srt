00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,508
NUMAZU FIRST GENERAL HOSPITAL

2
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:52,412
But I've got an appointment with
Dr. Hayami at 5 p.m.

3
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,981
He told me it was an urgent operation.

4
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:55,882
Did he?

5
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,220
Would you know when it finishes?

6
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,956
Oh, ma'am, what's the matter?

7
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,226
I'm sorry, I have not been feeling well
since this morning,

8
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,095
and I don't know which department
to go to.

9
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,163
LINEUP OF MODELS
HANDLING CABRERA SEQUENCE

10
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,998
The biggest difference between this
and past models

11
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,734
is the improvement in controllability and…

12
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,770
Improvement in controllability and…

13
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,142
great improvement in the
accuracy in data analysis.

14
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,444
What are you doing on your own?

15
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,014
-Oh. I'm practicing.
-Practicing?

16
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
I have to persuade him to
sign the contract today.

17
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,087
But Dr. Hayami has left already.

18
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,723
What? But the receptionist said that
he had an urgent operation.

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,092
He got away again.

20
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,361
Seriously?

21
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,697
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,332
It's okay.

23
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,140
Will Dr. Hayami be here tomorrow?

24
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,276
Well, I can't tell you that.

25
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,344
Yeah, I guess…

26
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,247
Hey, hey, hey… Segawa.

27
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,149
Oh, Mr. Ishida! Glad to see you here.

28
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,220
Don't tell me that you were…
beaten today as well.

29
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:08,888
Yes, I was…

30
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,893
Let's have a strategy meeting.
I've found a nice conference room.

31
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,829
Of course. Please let me join the meeting.

32
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,969
HOSTESS BAR

33
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,870
I've told you,

34
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:28,608
that Dr. Hayami does whatever I tell
him to where salespeople are concerned.

35
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,477
It's the timing. I am still waiting
for the perfect time.

36
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,545
Please help me with that.

37
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,180
Okay! Let's go to the next one.

38
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,481
The bill, please!

39
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,217
There you go.

40
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,654
MR. SEGAWA

41
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,822
290,000 yen!

42
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,458
Would you like to pay in cash or by card?

43
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,461
But the whiskey-and-water
and the fried chicken…

44
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,996
Hello.

45
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,101
Is there a problem with your bill?

46
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,137
Well, you have to list the items
on the bill…

47
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,809
Too close…

48
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,550
Yes?

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,086
Are you Who Are You's Aihara?

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,054
Yes?

51
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,626
KADOMATSU KYOGO

52
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,994
Seriously?

53
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,130
I'm honored!

54
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:29,235
It never occurred to me that I would
meet the legendary Kiichi Aihara.

55
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,937
The weakest guy ever.

56
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,541
Really? 100 to six? You're so stupid!

57
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,544
It was 100 to five.
Because Mr. Aihara ran away.

58
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,818
I thought you went to Tokyo.

59
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,756
I came back last month
because I was transferred.

60
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,761
So have you met the guys?

61
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,697
No, not yet.

62
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,166
Well, of course.

63
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,935
You wouldn't dare to meet them.

64
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,707
If you ask why I say he's stupid,
it's because at that time,

65
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,276
when those guys were being punched,
and if he had come…

66
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,244
Excuse me!

67
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,614
Hey! Stop struggling!

68
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,982
Hey!

69
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,265
Drive the car here.

70
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,166
Okay…

71
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,003
We're done here. Go home.

72
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,205
-But the money…
-This is Tagawa.

73
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,641
I've found the kid.

74
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,319
You're nothing but trouble.

75
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,721
Please have this.

76
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm exhausted.

77
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,726
Hey! Go now.

78
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,230
KADOMATSU LIMITED

79
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,404
It's getting colder.

80
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,544
GOOD AT FIGHTING;
THE MOST TERRIFYING LEGEND

81
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,364
-You! Search here!
-Okay.

82
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,000
-Find her even if you have to die!
-Okay…

83
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,674
Is she in the men's toilet?

84
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,843
Yes, I think she is.

85
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,181
Oh? It's you, wimp?

86
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,385
Hello.

87
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,422
Did you see the kid in our office
just now?

88
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,091
Yes? But just now…

89
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,265
-Why did you let her bite you?
-I'm sorry!

90
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,090
Bring her to our office
if you see her, got it?

91
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,559
Okay.

92
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,430
-Get away! It's your fault, idiot!
-I'm sorry!

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,818
Anyway, they'll do something
to help you if you go there.

94
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,656
Bye.

95
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,339
MARUTAKA STORE

96
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,306
Welcome.

97
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,374
Hello.

98
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,244
-Are you together?
-Together?

99
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,617
No, we're not… Gosh, she's eating already!

100
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,769
Will you stop that?
Don't get attached to me.

101
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,774
I know it's uncool for me to say it,

102
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,377
but I really don't want to have
anything to do with the gangsters.

103
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,513
Our company is fussy about
obeying rules and stuff…

104
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,985
What on earth am I saying?

105
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,235
Oh, officer…

106
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,370
Hey, you…

107
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,574
Hey.

108
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,781
SEGAWA

109
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,459
I'll put your change of clothes here.

110
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,265
It's really only for tonight.

111
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,034
You have to go
first thing tomorrow morning.

112
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,573
You ran away from home, didn't you?

113
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,875
That's why you don't want
to go to the police.

114
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,211
Well, I get it though.

115
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,081
When I ran away from home,
I kept getting away from

116
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,650
the cops… well, police officers as well.

117
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,187
But why are the gangsters looking for you?

118
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,090
Oh, you're that, right?

119
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,359
Like your parents are gangster bosses?

120
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,427
Seriously?

121
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,796
That's why the mob soldiers are
frantically looking for you.

122
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,034
Hang on… Are you done?

123
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,027
Grandma.

124
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,501
Grandma…

125
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,807
Have you phoned home?

126
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,517
Your parents must be worried.

127
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,869
How many hundred hours
will it take you to find

128
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,472
a kid with no money who can't run far?

129
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,774
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

130
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,944
Get the kid here now!

131
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,480
-Okay…
-Let's go!

132
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,450
Hurry… Let's go.

133
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,692
SHE IS EMACIATED, WITH PHYSICAL SCARS…

134
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,762
Make sure you go home, okay?

135
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,031
This is my key.

136
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,866
Put it in the mailbox outside.

137
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,643
It's not much,

138
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,480
but it's for your travel expenses,
and to buy some food if you're hungry.

139
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,656
What is your name?

140
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,763
Okay…

141
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,600
I'd like at least to hear your voice
before we say goodbye.

142
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,401
Never mind.

143
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,137
Bye.

144
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,705
Thank you.

145
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,277
Yes?

146
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,848
Thank you.

147
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,523
Bye.

149
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
Hello, ladies!

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,727
-Manager!
-Manager, it's mine.

151
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,196
There you go.

152
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,098
Heard the way he said that? He's so cute!

153
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,700
Sit here, Manager.

154
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,803
-Manager, come here.
-There? Okay.

155
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,238
Thank you, ladies.

156
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,540
Manager, open your mouth.

157
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,608
Yes.

158
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,176
He's so cute!

159
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,313
Manager, I want to sit in your lap.

160
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,816
Come sit in my lap.

161
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,825
Darn! Those stupid women…
I'm not there to entertain them.

164
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,135

00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,078
Keebou!

167
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,013
Choco…

168
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,418
You should have called
if you have come back, Keebou.

169
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,790
When was it?

170
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,995
A month ago.
I was transferred to the office here.

171
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,563
Living in your old home?

172
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,665
No, I live alone.

173
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,134
Where do you live?

174
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,236
It's opposite Sakurabashi,

175
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,772
the apartment where our senior,
Tacchan used to live.

176
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,641
What? It's close to mine.

177
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,610
Anyway, have a seat.

178
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,416
Let's have a gathering tonight, then.

179
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,552
No, thanks…

180
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,329
Are you still bothered by that incident?

181
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,535
This is absurd, Keebou. It was ages ago!

182
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,505
It has been ten years since…

183
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,877
It was just some kids' game.
No one worries about it anymore.

184
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,616
Is that why you didn't call?

185
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,786
Do you meet very often?

186
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,925
Well, sometimes. Not as often as before.
All of us have to work.

187
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,729
Choco, you're a manager?

188
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,833
Yeah. The place took me on.

189
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,302
I'm doing a job that
isn't suitable for me.

190
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,738
I think it suits you pretty well.

191
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,074
Hey! I don't want it to.

192
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,779
What about you?

193
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,216
I'm a salesperson. I work for
a medical instrument manufacturer.

194
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,687
I knew university graduates
were different.

195
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,092
I say…

196
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,829
There you are, Manager!
We have been waiting for you!

197
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,465
-You're too late…
-I'm coming.

198
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,967
I have to go now.
I've got to go to visit my clients.

199
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,102
But it's a Saturday.

200
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,870
That means nothing to a salesperson.

201
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,338
Bye.

202
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,540
Hello.

203
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,442
Hold on!

204
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,014
This is our new staff, Keebou! Go!

205
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,883
Choco!

206
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,453
Enjoy your time!

207
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,403
The sky is so gloomy.

208
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,115
Who are you?

209
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,585
MIKI TIRES

210
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,494
Hey! I have to sell that.

211
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,265
Don't click your tongue.
We've got a chair over there.

212
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,739
Did you do a wheelie with this?

213
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,907
No, I didn't.

214
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,909
You'll buy and replace the rim
if you've damaged it.

215
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,380
Oh, my! You're here, Pichan?

216
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,648
Pichan?

217
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,118
Grandma, Pichan's face is
more rectangular.

218
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,288
Where is Ponjara?

219
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,225
-Where is Tenten?
-No one is here.

220
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,062
Where are you going, Grandma?

221
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,867
-I have to pick up Kosuke.
-Don't bother. I'm here.

222
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,504
Oh, my!

223
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,241
Glad to know that.

224
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,180
What are Ponjara and Tenten?

225
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,050
They're my friends' nicknames.

226
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,588
-So uncool.
-Are they?

227
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,190
Were they your gangster friends?

228
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,025
Well, it wasn't actually a gang.

229
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,427
Do you still call each other that?

230
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,365
Do you still call a Hotchkiss
a stapler now?

231
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,967
What is a stapler?

232
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,301
You get what I mean.

233
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,571
I don't get it at all.

234
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,380
You can get that for 200,000 yen.

235
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,382
I don't want a gangster bike like this.

236
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,584
Biker gangs are out of date nowadays.

237
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,685
I see.

238
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,989
Friends are annoying, right?

239
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,291
You don't seem to have friends.

240
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,060
You need friends because you're weak.

241
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,597
Yeah. Okay, it's done.

242
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,132
WE COLLECT OLD BICYCLES FOR FREE

243
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,834
-Don't use it to do wheelies.
-Shut up!

244
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,875
How you doing?

245
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,410
Good. Cheers, dude.

246
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,645
Hey.

247
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,581
The big stain is totally removed.

248
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,249
Thanks, dude.

249
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,052
Well, it's Kayo's favorite.

250
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,487
It has always been.

251
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,658
She wanted to wear it this morning, too.

252
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,526
That's all she remembers.

253
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,296
Still the same?

254
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,097
Yeah.

255
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,634
Just tell me if you need anything.

256
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,437
Kayo had been very nice to me.

257
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,638
Thanks.

258
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,342
By the way, Mikki.

259
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,247
-He has come back.
-Who?

260
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,482
Keebou.

261
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,089
Choco met him by chance.
He called me straight away.

262
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,761
I see.

263
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,801
Where are you going, Grandma?

264
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,608
What's the matter, Kayo?

265
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,346
Oh, my! Keebou!

266
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,149
No… I'm Tenten. Tenten.

267
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,885
-Tenten!
-Yes.

268
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,922
Are you hungry, Tenten?

269
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,125
I would love to have the curry
you make again.

270
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,760
Okay. Come here.

271
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,161
You'll make it for me?

272
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,864
Let's go…

273
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,466
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,601
It's all right. Don't worry.

275
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,318
Who are you?

276
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,023
BENNY SUPERMARKET

277
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,436
SKELETON-SAURUS

278
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,213
Hey, little boy. Stop.

279
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,616
SKELETON-SAURUS

280
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,618
How do I know if you don't talk?

281
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,790
Just talk to me. I'm stupid,

282
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:08,627
but if we put our heads together
we'll come up with a good idea.

283
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,865
Don't get so scared.
It was just shoplifting,

284
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,034
-I…
-What do you mean by that?

285
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,439
Manager, I'm just trying to
understand how young people feel.

286
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,541
-Have you called the police?
-No, I haven't.

287
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,209
You have to do it at once!

288
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,478
But would you let me talk to him
for a bit before that?

289
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,013
Maybe he was bullied to do it.

290
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,382
What? You think you're a counselor?

291
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,118
I don't expect that from you.

292
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,320
I see.

293
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,392
Please! I promise I won't do this again!

294
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,061
Please! Just don't call the police!

295
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,663
You see?

296
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,534
Shoplifting means stealing.
It's a criminal offense. Okay?

297
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,438
-Come on! Call the police now!
-Okay…

298
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,043
Please! Please!
Just don't call the police…

299
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,979
This is Benny Corporation.

300
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,748
The Juvenile Division, please.

301
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,283
Yes. For shoplifting.

302
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,625
Who are you?

303
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,336
Pichan!

304
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,172
Oh, Mr. Akagi? Long time no see.

305
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,573
-Are you doing your job?
-Yes.

306
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,011
I know you must be tired, but please
let us see the cargo bed.

307
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,913
-Okay.
-Thanks.

308
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,384
Go.

309
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,153
Please have a look.

310
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,456
What has happened?

311
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,725
Kidnapping.

312
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,728
A ten-year-old girl.

313
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,167
Really? It's serious, isn't it?

314
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,103
You married a young, pretty lady,

315
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,538
so I thought maybe you liked little girls.

316
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,773
Don't joke about this!

317
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,445
I have to suspect everyone in my job.
Sorry about that.

318
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,781
I'll do anything to help,
because it's you.

319
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,684
The guys seem to be working hard.

320
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,519
Yes.

321
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,687
I'm happy, too.

322
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,123
It's all thanks to you.

323
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,460
Sorry about that.

324
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,830
-Sorry for causing you the trouble.
-It's all right.

325
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,965
Let's go out for a meal some time.
Ask the guys, too.

326
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,500
-Sure.
-Okay.

327
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,038
By the way, have you heard?
He has come back.

328
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,105
Who?

329
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,943
Kiichi Aihara.

330
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,115
Dr. Hayami, have you read our leaflet?

331
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,118
If you would call my mobile,

332
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,221
I could explain it to you at any time.

333
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,358
And… this…

334
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,861
We've made another…

335
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,164
Okay.

336
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,635
Thank you very much!

337
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,480
Hello.

338
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,451
Did the executive office's
Mr. Ishida say something?

339
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,953
Dr. Hayami took the leaflet today.

340
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,225
Dr. Hayami does not know
Mr. Ishida at all.

341
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,793
What?

342
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,897
Your neck.

343
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,632
Yes?

344
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,800
A hickey.

345
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,369
What?

346
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,281
Mom? What's the matter?

347
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,551
Yes? Now?

348
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,288
Okay.

349
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,563
I wonder if she has gone home.

350
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,781
HAYASHIDA CLEANING

351
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,883
Thank you, Noriaki.

352
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,418
Sorry for taking up so much time, Mom.

353
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,353
-It's okay.
-Please take this.

354
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,889
You're late!

355
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,758
Don't come out. You have to take
good care of yourself now.

356
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,594
Mr. Kogure in Nakamachi
needs this urgently.

357
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,661
Okay.

358
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,399
-What's wrong?
-What's the matter? Are you okay?

359
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,669
The two of them just
kicked me really hard.

360
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,338
Oh, come on!

361
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,305
Come.

362
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,011
Indeed. They're energetic.

363
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,679
We will meet them soon.

364
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,584
Mr. Kogure in Nakamachi, right?

365
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,152
-Thanks.
-Okay.

366
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,996
SEGAWA

367
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,732
I see…

368
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,036
Well, no news means good news.

369
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,742
You're staying for supper, aren't you?

370
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,810
Shall we order sushi?

371
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,914
Please don't bother.
I have to work later, sorry.

372
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,751
I see. That must be tough for you.

373
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,187
Well, it's a good thing that you are busy.

374
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,858
-Do you eat properly?
-Yeah.

375
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,827
If you like,

376
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,865
you can move here at any time you want.

377
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,567
Thank you.

378
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:53,238
Yuta used to like you, too.

379
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,708
Where is Yuta? Is he at school?

380
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,460
Yuta? It's me, Kiichi.

381
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,130
Sorry for not keeping in touch.

382
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,068
We haven't met for… three years?

383
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,306
I heard you weren't attending school.
What's happened?

384
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,241
Mr. Segawa…

385
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,877
I mean, your father is worried, too.

386
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,680
I'll listen if you want to talk.

387
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,118
Well, I used to skip school often, too,

388
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,820
so I can't talk down to you.

389
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,555
But…

390
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,623
It's all your fault!

391
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:47,459
What?

392
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,527
It's your fault that I…

393
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,834
They say my older brother is
a legendary wimp.

394
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,570
And he left his injured friends
and ran away.

395
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,841
It's your fault that people make me
a laughing stock, too!

396
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,944
They call me the Wimp's little brother.

397
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,322
Mikki?

398
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,326
Mikki…

399
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,151
Darn that stupid kid!

400
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,920
Hey, little girl!

401
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,290
No, they're not the girl.

402
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,459
-Let's go there.
-Okay.

403
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,565
No.

404
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,067
Let's check that just in case.

405
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,048
-Shima!
-What?

406
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,122
What?

407
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,023
SEGAWA

408
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,092
Oh?

409
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,134
Hey! I told you to go home.

410
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,405
Hm?

411
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,775
She's not here?

412
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,610
Hey.

413
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,964
What are you doing here?

414
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,035
Do you think that I'm angry at you?

415
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,937
Because you didn't go home.

416
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,079
And your stomach just rumbled?

417
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,253
Where did you find it?

418
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,023
It was found in the men's toilet
in Hiyoko Park.

419
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,192
What?

420
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,006
How dare that wimp underestimate me?

421
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,714
Sorry to have kept you waiting. Oh?

422
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,719
Oh, come on.

423
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,045
I say,

424
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:31,916
why is someone supposed to have taken
a sick leave now in Okinawa?

425
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,284
What?

426
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,820
Gross? Me?

427
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,456
How dare you look down on your manager…

428
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,294
Welcome.

429
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,906
Long time no see, huh?

430
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,692
I'm home.

431
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,932
Pichan! Welcome home!

432
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,735
Come! Look at this!

433
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,772
Please! Can I buy this, please?

434
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,807
You just have to buy a pan.

435
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,743
But this is totally different!

436
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,545
You don't need oil to cook with it,
isn't it amazing?

437
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,281
-Please can I click "buy"?
-How much?

438
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,452
It's 19,800 yen! And it comes with
a nutcracker if you buy it now!

439
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,054
Do we actually use a nutcracker?

440
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,458
I can't buy it?

441
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,765
You're right. I always buy
so much useless stuff…

442
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,701
I'm sorry that I don't even use
a nutcracker.

443
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,571
It's okay, just buy it.
I want to have walnuts anyway.

444
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,041
Really?

445
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,877
Pichan! I love you!

446
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,053
Hi, Kayo!

447
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,958
-There you go.
-Thank you.

448
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,227
Cheers.

449
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,666
You don't have to work?

450
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,169
No, I'm off-shift now.

451
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,237
You haven't been drinking lately?

452
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,773
I don't know when I have to drive,
that's why.

453
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,109
Your job is tough, Mikki.

454
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,744
It's all right.

455
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,880
-Oh.
-Hey!

456
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,015
Kayo!

457
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,856
There you go.

458
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,424
Thank you.

459
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,028
-I saw him, too.
-Yes?

460
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,930
Keebou.

461
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,801
-Really?
-Really. Just for a moment.

462
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,136
A moment?

463
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,572
<i>We passed each other by chance.</i>

464
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,574
<i>On Sakurabashi.</i>

465
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,176
-Did you talk?
-No.

466
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,347
<i>He seemed like he had something</i>
<i>to say, though.</i>

467
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,683
Did he? And you ignored him?

468
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,418
Not exactly ignored…

469
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,490
It's just…

470
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,162
I was carrying Grandma on my back
at that time.

471
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,232
So?

472
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,970
I thought, "Why did he come back
now? Darn him."

473
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,275
I mean, we haven't met Keebou
in ten years.

474
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,145
Why did he come back now?

475
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,248
I see.

476
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,585
We did something unkind to him.

477
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,324
Maybe he thinks I am still angry
about the incident ten years ago.

478
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,826
I am still angry.

479
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,762
Yes?

480
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,963
I am still angry about that.

481
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,299
Choco?

482
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,836
Of course I am! Are you not angry?

483
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,906
How can you forgive that traitor?
He betrayed us!

484
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,745
Oh, I'm sorry.

485
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,413
I'm sorry, Kayo.

486
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,248
Feel free to sing.

487
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,822
You know…

488
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,626
He seems to be in some kind of
trouble now.

489
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,396
You remember Tagawa?

490
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,733
Black Mouse's chancellor, and he was
promoted to a yakuza group.

491
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,938
-Oh.
-He came here today.

492
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,174
And asked me whether
I knew where he lived or not.

493
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,777
What did you say?

494
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,719
WHO ARE YOU

495
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,067
Did you… have a nightmare?

496
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,038
Sort of.

497
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,281
I had one, too.

498
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,050
Did you?

499
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,759
Don't worry.

500
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,429
I think it's my stuff.
Someone called me just now.

501
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,240
What?

502
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,311
Aihara, I know you're here.

503
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,179
Come out!

504
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:07,084
Give me the kid! Or I'll kill you! Aihara!

505
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,121
I know you're home! Hey!

506
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,824
You… You didn't run away from home, right?

507
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,827
What happened?

508
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,264
Why are the gangsters after you?

509
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,867
I don't know…

510
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,503
-Where are you parents?
-I don't know.

511
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,739
You don't know? Who are you?

512
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,710
I don't know! I can't remember!

513
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,626
COME HAVE FUN!

514
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,030
Go there.

515
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,867
My friend is there.

516
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,571
He will surely help you.

517
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,409
SEGAWA

518
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,645
You can go on your own, right?

519
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,114
I can't!

520
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,083
I can't!

521
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,785
Don't cry! Show me some courage.

522
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,288
You can go on your own. You will win.

523
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,094
Don't go to be defeated. Go to win.

524
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,062
Listen.

525
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,265
Don't be defeated until you win.

526
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,735
No matter how hard they punch you,

527
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,870
as long as you don't think
that you've lost,

528
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,473
you'll just be on your way
to win the battle.

529
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,524
Until you win…

530
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,459
Don't be defeated.

531
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,340
-Come out!
-Give us the kid!

532
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,941
I know you're home!

533
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,344
-Are you listening?
-Hey!

534
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,946
What's the matter?

535
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,948
-Get lost!
-Hey, guys!

536
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:18,983
Get lost!

537
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,454
What are you doing? You're trespassing!

538
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,790
Gosh! And you haven't taken off
your shoes.

539
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,326
Give me the kid.

540
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,828
What kid?

541
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,597
Where have you hidden the kid?

542
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,966
I don't know any kid.

543
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,970
Hey! I'm asking you where the kid is!

544
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,273
I'll call the police if you don't stop.

545
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,674
Hey!

546
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:48,679
It hurts! Anyway, you should
brush your teeth properly.

547
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,683
-Stand up now!
-Fine, I'm going with you.

548
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,569
What are you doing?

549
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,676
Until you win…

550
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,578
Don't be defeated.

551
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,667
SATOJIMA

552
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:46,937
Okay.

553
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:49,440
There you go.

554
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,613
Here.

555
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,833
I wonder what Masayoshi is having now.

556
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,671
What is the best food in Singapore?

557
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,673
Why didn't you go with him
on his business trip?

558
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,942
You're newly-weds after all.

559
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,013
Masayoshi…

560
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,918
I mean your father, he told me to
wait for him here.

561
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,820
I guess…

562
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,391
He wants us to get along.

563
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,494
I mean the two of us…

564
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,163
I don't want supper!

565
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,608
Get along? Are you kidding me?

566
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,960
What? Watch the road!

567
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:19,630
Excuse me.

568
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,737
NO ENTRY

569
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,340
Don't go too far!

570
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,981
Stand up!

571
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:37,948
Come here.

572
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,450
Sit!

573
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,228
You underestimated us. How dare you?

574
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,299
Wimp, where is the kid?

575
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,635
Kid?

576
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,572
It's time for the kids to poop
and take a nap now.

577
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,512
Don't feign ignorance, jerk!

578
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,116
I'll ask you once more.

579
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,018
Where is the kid?

580
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,855
I said, I don't know.

581
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,858
What kid are you talking about?

582
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,694
I see.

583
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,630
-Stand up! Now!
-Now!

584
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,300
<i>Choco, you said you met him?</i>

585
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,137
You met him?

586
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,905
Yeah.

587
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:37,841
He ran into me.

588
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,912
So, how was he?

589
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,016
Well, he looked cheerful.

590
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,953
-Why did he come back?
-He…

591
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,325
He said he was transferred here,
but we didn't talk much.

592
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,595
-Son of a gun.
-How dare he look down on us?

593
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,368
How could he bring himself
to meet us, seriously?

594
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,937
That jerk, Keebou.

595
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,174
Guys,

596
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,243
it was ten years ago.

597
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,314
It can be ten years or 100 years,
but this won't go away.

598
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,017
The fact that he betrayed his friends.

599
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,086
Ditto. That idiot.

600
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,954
Ditto. That jerk.

601
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,156
Oh, well.

602
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,033
Don't force yourself, wimp.

603
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:42,673
You betrayed your friends ten years
ago and turned tail, didn't you?

604
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,877
Don't try to show us your courage.

605
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,358
Don't get too carried away, wimp!

606
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:06,096
Don't underestimate us!

607
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,298
If he had come at that time,

608
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,400
we wouldn't have been defeated.

609
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,036
That's the one thing that
we will never know.

610
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:14,938
<i>It was 100 versus six.</i>

611
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,273
<i>There could be 100 or 200 of them,</i>

612
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,509
<i>but we would have won if all</i>
<i>six of us had been there.</i>

613
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,146
-We would have won.
-We would have.

614
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,048
If Keebou had been there back then
we would have won.

615
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,186
He was that type of person.

616
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,789
That was what he meant to us.

617
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,124
Say it, idiot!

618
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,060
Hey, wimp!

619
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,197
It's time to give yourself a break.

620
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,533
Where did you hide the kid?

621
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,637
-I said, I don't know.
-Mr. Tagawa, why have you been

622
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,172
calling him a wimp?

623
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,507
What are you, an idiot?

624
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,676
I told you back in the office!

625
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,312
Well, I was half-way through it.

626
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,715
This legendary wimp…

627
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,085
<i>10 years ago,</i>

628
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:06,190
<i>our team and his team were</i>
<i>under the same union.</i>

629
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,659
We were the biggest,

630
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,461
<i>and those guys were the smallest,</i>
<i>with only six people.</i>

631
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,034
<i>There were only six of them,</i>
<i>but they were seriously strong.</i>

632
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,703
<i>We had a really hard time fighting them.</i>

633
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:29,079
Our group had been dealing
with the gangster problem,

634
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,481
and we started to
join force with the union.

635
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,751
When the gangsters started
distributing drugs in the union

636
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,921
Keebou was the first to lead us to
fight the leaders.

637
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:44,027
Those guys started to tell off the guys
who touched the drugs.

638
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:48,699
He said he would make them take
responsibility if they did it again.

639
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,468
Even when he was threatened
by the leaders, too…

640
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:56,540
He actually said something cool,
like, "I will draw the line myself."

641
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,441
Didn't you, wimp?

642
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,312
When we called your group out
to fight, only you fled.

643
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,050
If we had won that time,

644
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,387
<i>things would definitely</i>
<i>have been different.</i>

645
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,956
<i>Many people in the union</i>

646
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,893
<i>were seriously beaten up</i>
<i>because of the drug incident.</i>

647
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,396
WHO ARE YOU

648
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,133
Darn!

649
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,235
Why?

650
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,540
Why did he run away at the last moment?

651
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,177
<i>He almost picked the fight himself,</i>
<i>and yet…</i>

652
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,480
<i>he forced it onto us.</i>

653
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,882
He had an exam.

654
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:40,851
What?

655
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,421
The day of our fight was on the same day
as his university entry exams.

656
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,290
What the heck?

657
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:51,862
He had to take the exam at that time.

658
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:53,964
What do you mean?

659
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,968
His mother was his only family.

660
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,838
His mother's boyfriend back then

661
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,675
was a high-ranking civil servant.

662
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,746
<i>She didn't want him to know that</i>
<i>her son was a gangster</i>

663
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,148
<i>well-known in the local area,</i>

664
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,651
<i>so his mother lied to the guy.</i>

665
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,622
<i>She told him that</i>
<i>her son was an honest student.</i>

666
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,094
<i>But when the guy proposed to his mother,</i>

667
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,730
<i>his mother knew that</i>
<i>the guy would know that she lied,</i>

668
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,866
<i>so she was going to reject him.</i>

669
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,535
<i>Then…</i>

670
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,938
<i>Keebou said that if he really passed</i>
<i>the university entry exam,</i>

671
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,375
<i>then what his mother said</i>
<i>would not be a lie.</i>

672
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,346
That's why Keebou studied very hard.

673
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,149
All the time… Alone.

674
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,755
So that his mother's lie would come true

675
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,291
and she could get married with dignity.

676
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,862
How did you know that?

677
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,664
A while later

678
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,367
Keebou's mother told my grandma.

679
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:08,171
-Why didn't you tell…
-I was really upset, too!

680
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,241
I heard it

681
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,778
and thought he was an idiot
to put his mom before his friends.

682
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:18,648
But…

683
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,021
I can now relate to that.

684
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:28,025
I understand how he felt.

685
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,263
It's stupid to carry a burden
on the shoulder.

686
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,266
It's too heavy and you can't fly.

687
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:39,936
But…

688
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,777
Everybody has to bear a burden
on their shoulder at some point.

689
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,114
Only kids can have nothing on their back.

690
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,083
I didn't have anything on my
shoulder at that time.

691
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,485
He was the only one…

692
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,824
to have a burden to carry first.

693
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:08,932
I understand it now.

694
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,202
<i>He was the one who was in pain.</i>

695
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,940
Why, then…

696
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,277
Why didn't he tell us?

697
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,848
That means he didn't trust us.

698
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,085
He said we were friends,
but it meant nothing.

699
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,556
In the end he didn't show up after that
and went straight to Tokyo,

700
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,091
then that was it.

701
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,892
That's who he is.

702
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,395
That's why he got into trouble
with the gangsters.

703
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,298
He got into trouble with gangsters?

704
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't know much.

705
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:49,072
I heard that he was hiding a girl
who was wanted by the gangsters.

706
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,175
This is funny.

707
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,978
He made an enemy of the gangsters.

708
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,416
Choco, you…

709
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,122
You sold out a guy who made an enemy
of the gangsters to protect a kid?

710
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,724
What do you mean by sold out?

711
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,627
They asked me, so I told them.

712
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,368
That's why he couldn't tell us.

713
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,305
-It's because we're all scum!
-What?

714
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,243
You said we were friends,

715
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,513
but only you do everything
to protect yourself.

716
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,516
Okay, let's hold our hands
and don't let go.

717
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,751
Don't ever let go
and we'll watch each other's back!

718
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,820
-What the heck, Mikki?
-Stop it!

719
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,260
Stop that, both of you.

720
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,365
You…

721
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,941
-Help!
-Yes?

722
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,342
Help!

723
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,545
This girl is…

724
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,046
She said she wants to come here.

725
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,147
Please!

726
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,149
Help me.

727
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,618
They brought the gentleman away.

728
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,155
Is this girl the one
Keebou has been hiding?

729
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,259
He told me his friend was here.

730
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,996
He said that
his friend would surely help me.

731
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,102
LET'S ALL SING TOGETHER
KARAOKE BOX URARA

732
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,539
He told me not to be defeated…

733
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,376
Not to be defeated until I win.

734
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,350
It has to be Keebou.

735
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,885
What was that?

736
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,754
It's what Keebou used to say
before he fought.

737
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,624
You said that…

738
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,027
we wouldn't have been defeated
if Keebou were there.

739
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,496
I think so, too.

740
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,433
Because he never admits defeat.

741
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,803
No matter how beaten up he was,

742
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,139
he would say that we were going to win
if we didn't admit defeat.

743
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,576
At that time…

744
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,913
The reason we lost wasn't
because Keebou wasn't there.

745
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,151
It was because we admitted defeat.

746
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,896
Grandma, please take care of her.

747
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,465
Hang on, Mikki.

748
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,101
It's not a good idea
to fight with gangsters.

749
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,340
-I was wrong.
-Yes?

750
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,745
Someone can still fly

751
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,180
when they're bearing a burden.

752
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,022
Somehow…

753
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,058
Mikki was so cool that it was gross.

754
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,059
Yeah.

755
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,196
So isn't it uncool
if we don't go with him now?

756
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,433
-Okay, let's go then!
-Let's go!

757
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,868
If you're fighting, I'll go with you!

758
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,688
KARAOKE BOX URARA

759
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,591
Hey!

760
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,462
Hi, I'll drive you there.

761
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,731
Don't come with us.

762
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,232
Your kids will be born soon.

763
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,967
It's all right…

764
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,837
It's the shutdown club that used to
belong to Kadomatsu Limited, right?

765
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,373
I pass by it along my way home, so get in.

766
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,441
What?

767
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,509
I thought you wanted to fly?

768
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,278
You see…

769
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,114
What you guys put at my place…

770
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,216
If only we have them…

771
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,618
WHO ARE YOU

772
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,587
Even we can…

773
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,357
Oh!

774
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,193
You're late, Choco.

775
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,733
Drive now.

776
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,835
-Shut up and get in the van!
-Let's go!

777
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,475
Hey.

778
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,177
You should tell us now.

779
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,947
Where is the kid?

780
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,751
I have no idea.

781
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:43,666
Yes?

782
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:46,436
I'm sorry.

783
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,506
He's more stubborn than I thought.

784
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,641
Is he?

785
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,576
Do your best.

786
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,547
Well, if it's necessary,

787
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,282
use that.

788
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,554
Yes, sir.

789
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,626
But if he is still not talking,

790
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,261
then maybe he really doesn't know.

791
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:12,695
What?

792
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,298
How can you be so naïve?

793
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,869
Why? Did you say it for old time's sake?

794
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,639
<i>No, that's not what I meant.</i>

795
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:26,242
Anyway, make him tell you
as soon as possible.

796
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,112
After he tells you…

797
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:31,314
Kill him.

798
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,895
I'm so grateful that you were there
to help with the surgery yesterday.

799
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,565
Every other nurse here is useless.

800
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,033
KIICHI SEGAWA

801
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,808
Dr. Hayami,

802
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,579
have you decided on the replacement
of the diagnostic imaging apparatus?

803
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,148
Oh, it's time to choose a manufacturer.

804
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,816
What will you base the choice on?

805
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,184
Base it on?

806
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,121
On how well they entertain you, or…

807
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,093
Well, I'll choose based on functions,
like analytical accuracy.

808
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,601
I think this is pretty good.

809
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,704
The one made by the manufacturer
who you keep ignoring.

810
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,077
Stop acting, will you?

811
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:38,147
Just tell us like the wimp you are.

812
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,683
Why do you care?

813
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,920
What happens to a kid not related
to you is none of your business.

814
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,258
You're the one who is putting on
an act, Mr. Tagawa.

815
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,860
What are you saying?

816
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,630
Mr. Tagawa.

817
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,066
Those were the good old days.

818
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,102
What?

819
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:03,473
<i>We kept doing stupid things and mischief,</i>

820
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,111
but somehow… we had
some hidden rules, hadn't we?

821
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,650
Never betray your friends,
and never harm women and children.

822
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,554
The person who stuck
most firmly to the rules

823
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,656
was you, wasn't it?

824
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,724
Chancellor.

825
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,031
I say, Aihara.

826
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:33,436
It has ended. The time when
we were kids and those rules applied.

827
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,774
You're right.

828
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,211
How stupid I was.

829
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:48,217
I studied very hard and betrayed
my friends and got this in return.

830
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,653
Every day I bow my head
and fawn on people,

831
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,655
drink the sake that I hate to drink;

832
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,657
I got looked down on and ignored…

833
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,861
How stupid!

834
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,664
Ah, this is really stupid!

835
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,200
Why is that?

836
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,037
Why is being an adult so stupid?

837
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,276
Why is it so darn dull?
Tell me, Chancellor!

838
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:27,624
A punch like this does not hurt at all.

839
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,494
When compared to the guys back then.

840
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,399
I wanted to go.

841
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,203
I knew this at that time!

842
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,205
I knew I would regret it for
the rest of my life.

843
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,674
I knew it!

844
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,480
It doesn't hurt when people call me
a wimp or a coward.

845
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,017
It's not important.

846
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,387
You betrayed your friends
and you alone were saved.

847
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,423
If I have to bear this burden for life,

848
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,759
then I'd rather be killed!

849
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,328
-Hey!
-Sit down!

850
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,735
I wanted to go! I did!

851
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,272
I wanted to get beaten up with them!

852
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:19,642
No…

853
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,247
We wouldn't have been defeated
if I had gone. We would have won!

854
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,016
This is absurd.

855
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,352
It was 100 to six.

856
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,821
It could be 100 people or 200 people,

857
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,124
but we would not have been defeated
if all of us had been there!

858
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,293
This is stupid.

859
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:41,464
They said the same thing, too.

860
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:45,001
When they got beaten up by us,

861
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,304
they said they would have killed us
in seconds if Keebou were there.

862
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,676
They were right.

863
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,247
Because it's a fact.

864
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,953
But Chancellor…

865
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,057
my daily routine
is incredibly dull and boring,

866
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,259
but I'm not going to be defeated!

867
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,196
I won't be defeated until I win.

868
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,931
They won't, either.

869
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,500
They have not been defeated!

870
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,169
We are still…

871
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,305
on our way to claim our victory!

872
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:32,515
Keebou!

873
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,552
We have come to win.

874
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,020
Keebou.

875
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,027
WHO ARE YOU

876
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,503
Who are you?

877
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,512
Who are you?

878
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,016
I am…

879
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:11,554
I am…

880
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,656
myself!

881
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,225
Good!

882
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,486
-Who are you?
-My name is Toru.

883
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,453
It's not important.

884
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,205
Don't underestimate the yakuza.

885
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,507
I'll kill you.

886
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,084
Keebou!

887
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:19,155
What are you doing?

888
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,024
I saw it in a movie.

889
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,829
If you pull the trigger now
the gun will fire accidentally.

890
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,998
My hand will be blown off,

891
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,734
but your whole person,
even your face, will turn into a mess.

892
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,907
Shall we try it?

893
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,076
To see if it's true.

894
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,024
I remember it now.

895
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,393
How stupidly brave you are.

896
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,062
Cheers.

897
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,533
Take this!

898
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,070
NUMAZU FIRST GENERAL HOSPITAL

899
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:43,873
It hurts…

900
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,642
I told you.

901
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,845
I fell down the stairs when I was
worrying about my sales record.

902
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,316
I'm telling the truth!

903
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,018
You've sold one.

904
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,353
Yes?

905
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,790
Dr. Hayami said that he will surely
show up in the next appointment.

906
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,494
He'd like you to tell him
about the functions.

907
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:14,804
You're crying?

908
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,106
I wasn't defeated.

909
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,543
I was on my way to claim my victory.

910
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,948
Sorry, I don't get what you said.

911
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,096
It was me.

912
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,264
I sold you out.

913
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,066
To Tagawa.

914
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,408
I see.

915
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,277
Thanks.

916
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,286
I wanted to get beaten up.
I have always wanted that.

917
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:08,057
Bad as you guys were at that time.

918
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:15,498
I was responsible for that.

919
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,805
What are you, a masochist?

920
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:26,509
A university graduate
does talk differently.

921
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:32,214
-Sure.
-Gosh, you're infuriating.

922
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,687
<i>Lost her memory?</i>

923
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,758
She doesn't seem to remember stuff
like her own name.

924
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,427
That's why I don't get it.

925
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,130
Why are the gangsters after her?

926
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,700
Where had she been and what had she done
before she met me?

927
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,438
We really have to ask the question,
"Who are you?"

928
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,576
Who are you?

929
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,249
Mr. Akagi!

930
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,485
What are you doing?
Having a class reunion?

931
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,386
Long time no see, Mr. Akagi!

932
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,754
Hey, Ponjara.

933
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:46,956
You're working hard, aren't you?

934
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,424
Yes!

935
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,664
She's the girl?

936
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,803
Are you hurt?

937
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,342
Someone in the neighborhood reported this.

938
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,344
-I'll take her with me.
-Why?

939
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,315
-But I…
-I know.

940
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,852
You have been protecting her from
the Kadomatsu Group's gangsters.

941
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:21,257
I think I'll have to ask you
about the details later,

942
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,493
but I'll take her back
to her parents for now.

943
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,166
I'm happy for you.

944
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,602
Come with me.

945
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,676
Don't worry. You can trust him.

946
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:44,613
He was very kind to us
when we were bad kids.

947
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:57,626
Let's go.

948
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,696
-Sorry for the interruption.
-Please take care of her.

949
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,064
Work hard, guys.

950
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,400
-Sure.
-We will.

951
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,677
Mr. Akagi.

952
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,679
What's the matter?

953
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,849
What is her name?

954
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,851
It's Hikari.

955
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,255
Hikari Goto.

956
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:30,626
HIKARI GOTO

957
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,660
Hikari.

958
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,431
What a lovely name.

959
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,935
See you, Hikari.

960
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:42,738
See you, Keebou.

961
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,712
-Bye.
-Thanks.

962
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:18,474
<i>Stay away from that kid.</i>

963
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,608
<i>I'm telling you to stop.</i>

964
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,911
<i>I want to see this through.</i>

965
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:24,580
You're that guy after all!

966
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,581
I want the truth.

967
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,616
Then let's go find the truth.

968
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,119
-Keebou!
-Don't hide the truth!

969
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:31,954
<i>Show us what you're made of!</i>
