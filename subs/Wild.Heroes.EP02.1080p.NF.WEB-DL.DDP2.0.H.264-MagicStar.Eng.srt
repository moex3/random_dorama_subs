1
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>Who are you?</i>

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,447
I am myself!

3
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,116
Why are the gangsters after you?

4
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,684
I don't know.

5
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,988
-Who are you?
-I can't remember!

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,122
Where is the kid?

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,191
Don't feign ignorance!

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,860
After he tells you, kill him.

9
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,797
Don't be defeated until you win.

10
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,734
Mr. Akagi.

11
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,169
<i>Someone in the neighborhood reported this.</i>

12
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,337
<i>I'll take her with me.</i>

13
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,473
<i>Don't worry. You can trust him.</i>

14
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,551
It's not in the newspaper today either?

15
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,060
He took a vacation?

16
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,229
Yeah, Mr. Akagi is on vacation.

17
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,232
I'd like to know
whether the kidnapped child

18
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,134
has come back home safely or not.

19
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,103
-Kidnapped?
-Yes.

20
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,572
Nothing has been said about it
in the newspaper and the news.

21
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,974
What are you talking about? Kidnap?

22
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,144
It's the case from two days ago
which Mr. Akagi is in charge of.

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,214
Mr. Akagi's holiday
started three days ago.

24
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,015
But…

25
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,486
What?

26
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,488
KARAOKE BOX URARA

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,724
But this is strange, somehow…

28
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,327
It's like this case has never existed.

29
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,029
Mr. Akagi was on leave on that day.

30
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,431
It's not unusual.

31
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,567
I mean for detectives to work on cases
on vacation.

32
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,569
He used to do this
when he was dealing with us, too.

33
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,339
"My daughter has her sports day today!"

34
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,040
"How dare you cause this needless chaos?"

35
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,475
-I'm sorry!
-Like that.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,777
I know, but…

37
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,281
But Hikari was…

38
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,282
Officer…

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,850
Hey, you…

40
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,754
<i>She was very frightened of policemen.</i>

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,191
What's wrong with you, Keebou?

42
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,260
Don't tell me that you distrust Mr. Akagi?

43
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,530
-No, I'm not doubtful…
-Have you forgotten this?

44
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,033
Have you forgotten
how much Mr. Akagi helped us?

45
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,669
He even found me my job.

46
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,571
No, I haven't!

47
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,606
I haven't forgotten it, but…

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,176
We're not the only ones, right?

49
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,913
We're not the only ones
who owe Mr. Akagi a lot.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,183
-Also lots of people in this town.
-I know!

51
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,084
But…

52
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,654
Oh, Kayo!

53
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,291
Anyway, we've done the right thing
to leave this to Mr. Akagi.

54
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,492
Okay?

55
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,393
Kayo!

56
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,699
Don't worry.

57
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,303
Mr. Akagi doesn't do anything bad.

58
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:30,443
I wonder if the Board of Education
can look up a child's address…

59
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,879
I mean…

60
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,649
My mom's husband is working for
Board of Education of this prefecture now.

61
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,884
Don't do this, Keebou.

62
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,221
Nothing good will come out of it
even if you do that.

63
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,059
Hey!

64
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,494
I don't know…

65
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,133
Where have you put it?

66
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,438
I don't know… I don't know!

67
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,152
Is it here?

68
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,055
Give me that!

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,261
Let's see.

70
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,069
Darn!

71
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,174
Poor teddy bear.

72
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,578
The guys are so cruel.

73
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,415
Hikari.

74
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,717
Where is it? Tell me.

75
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,254
Come on, tell me.

76
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,623
Hikari, tell me where it is.

77
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,925
HIKARI GOTO

78
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:53,960
Please help me!

79
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,299
I know very well that
this is an unreasonable request.

80
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,968
But… Please help me!

81
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,238
What is your reason?

82
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,543
I desperately want to know
where she lives. I'm worried about her.

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,514
I'm repeating myself, but…

84
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,085
I cannot reveal a child's personal data.

85
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,423
I will definitely not cause you
any trouble, Mr. Segawa.

86
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,059
I promise!

87
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,695
Kiichi…

88
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,930
Don't trouble your father.

89
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,899
Of course it's impossible.

90
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,705
Kiichi. Please.

91
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,281
Where is it?

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,651
I don't know.

93
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,087
I really don't know.

94
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,990
I hate it when children lie!

95
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,962
It's not a lie… I'm not lying.

96
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,337
Hikari, do you love your dad?

97
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,215
Dad…

98
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,653
Can you really not remember it?

99
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,833
Darling.

100
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,704
I wonder when Kiichi will call me…

101
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,073
Call me dad.

102
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,509
Well,

103
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,511
the door swings both ways.

104
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,550
I still can't call Kiichi
by his name yet, either.

105
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,354
Darling…

106
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,057
Don't do anything stupid.

107
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,660
It was the first time, Sumiko.

108
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,662
It was the first time…

109
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,232
that he had asked me
to do something for him.

110
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,470
But he couldn't even give you
a good reason…

111
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,374
He could have made up
as many reasons as possible.

112
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,544
But Kiichi did not do that.

113
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,914
You know…

114
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,917
I love him.

115
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,889
I think I love him
much more than you think.

116
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,700
Listen.

117
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,636
If you say anything unnecessary…

118
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,441
Sorry that I've frightened you.

119
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,979
But I'm betting my life on this.

120
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,487
HOTEL EIKOKUKAN

121
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,468
What have you been listening to?

122
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,172
Shiho…

123
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,342
-I think our relationship…
-I don't want to hear that.

124
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,410
Shiho, you…

125
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:44,123
Say, can you remember anything
about your school?

126
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,198
INTERNAL MEDICINE

127
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,133
Thank you very much.

128
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,737
CASHIER

129
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,206
-How much is it?
-48000 yen, please.

130
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,390
-Let's go.
-Take care.

131
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,433
Please think about this.

132
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,489
Let's go.

133
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,195
TO WASHIO CENTRAL HOSPITAL

134
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,671
Okay…

135
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,809
There you go.

136
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,044
It's dirty now…

137
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
Don't worry.

138
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,882
My friend runs a laundry shop.

139
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,619
-This is for you.
-No, it's okay…

140
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,924
Where did you get this?

141
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,194
A ten-year-old girl…

142
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,897
She was here with a police officer.

143
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,332
Officer?

144
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,969
Is the police officer over 50 years old…

145
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,739
It's our patient's personal information,
we can't reveal more.

146
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,477
-But…
-I said…

147
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,980
What's the matter with the girl?

148
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,282
Well, she…

149
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,721
Do you happen to know her address or…

150
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,624
Of course I can't tell you.

151
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,326
I knew it…

152
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,465
Yes.

153
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:10,770
Her memory is repressed because of
high levels of stress and shock…

154
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,273
That is, so-called amnesia.

155
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,011
Keebou…

156
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,150
<i>Don't cry!</i>

157
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,886
<i>Show me your courage! You will surely win.</i>

158
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,555
Until you win…

159
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,657
Don't be defeated.

160
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,929
Don't be defeated until I win.

161
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,265
Until I win…

162
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,101
Caught you.

163
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,904
MIKI TIRES

164
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,340
What? Sneak into the hospital?

165
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,709
<i>Yeah, so…</i>

166
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,278
I need someone to keep watch for me.

167
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,815
So I was wondering if you would help me…

168
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,118
What are you, an idiot?
That's a criminal offense!

169
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,620
But it's the only way to find out
where Hikari is.

170
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,523
I mean, Mikki, this is really fishy.

171
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,092
Why did a policeman accompany her
to the hospital now?

172
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,327
Shouldn't it be her parents?

173
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,163
<i>-I mean, her kidnap…</i>
-Keebou!

174
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,599
Are you a little too engrossed with this?

175
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,934
What do you mean by too engrossed?

176
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,071
You have saved the girl from Tagawa
and the gangsters.

177
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,205
Isn't that enough?

178
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,142
-But Mikki…
-I say, don't do this!

179
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,011
<i>You shouldn't do any more.</i>

180
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,480
<i>I just have this feeling.</i>

181
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,324
CALLER: MIKKI

182
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,559
Hey!

183
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,697
-It's a woman, right?
-No, it's Mikki.

184
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,566
-That's a woman.
-That would be Minnie.

185
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,371
FISH

186
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,141
Ma'am.

187
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,711
Put it… here first, okay?

188
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,285
You did it again?

189
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,723
How many times do I have to tell you?

190
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,225
Your job is,

191
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,994
after you have confirmed
someone has shoplifted in the store,

192
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,931
-to catch them in the act.
-I'm sorry.

193
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,599
Gosh, you're useless!

194
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,501
I would have fired you ages ago

195
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,870
if you hadn't been referred here
by the policeman.

196
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,771
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,744
CALLER: MIKKI

198
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,049
What? Seriously?
Keebou is still saying that?

199
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,018
But that would mean trouble.

200
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,587
Of course I stopped him.

201
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,289
But I don't think he's happy with that.

202
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,124
Stop him if he calls you.

203
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,396
Choco? I called him, but he didn't answer.

204
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,633
Yes? A nutcracker?

205
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,872
Why? But you got a nutcracker
along with the pan.

206
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,308
But it is not a doll!

207
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,179
Please! Pichan, can I click "buy"? Please!

208
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,982
-How much?
<i>-29,800 yen.</i>

209
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,619
That's expensive!
Saya, do you really need that?

210
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,287
PASSED THE TEST
PUPPY-CHAN NO. TWO

211
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,321
<i>I can't buy it?</i>

212
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,059
I'm sorry… I keep buying useless things…

213
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,995
No… That's not what I mean.

214
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,899
Okay. You can buy it.

215
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,568
Okay. Click "buy".

216
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,542
Oh, ma'am! I'd like to change
the tempura soba to soba in soup.

217
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,912
This is ridiculous!

218
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,549
-Yes? What would you like…
-<i>Pi? It's me.</i>

219
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,084
What? It's you?

220
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,022
-<i>Don't be ridiculous, stupid Pon!</i>
-Why are you mad so suddenly?

221
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,692
Keebou won't change his mind
once he has made it up.

222
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,327
Yeah…

223
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:33,399
I hope he'll get hold of Mr. Akagi soon
and find out how the girl is.

224
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,607
Can we meet tomorrow?

225
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,209
Let's end this.

226
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,579
-The relationship isn't healthy.
-I'll die.

227
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,450
I'll die if you break up with me.

228
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,554
That again?

229
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:58,991
I'm serious.

230
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,828
If you're gone in my life
I'm all on my own.

231
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,463
Living is pointless.

232
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,865
-You have a husband.
-It doesn't matter!

233
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,635
The depths of loneliness

234
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,603
on a physical and
a mental level are different.

235
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,906
What? What are you saying?

236
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,377
You are my everything, Shuntaro.

237
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,064
Mikki!

238
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,801
What… Huh?

239
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,338
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

240
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,340
Did Mikki call you all here?

241
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,276
No, I didn't.
They came without telling me.

242
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,412
-Why would I take so much trouble?
-Then why did you come?

243
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,948
Just so you know,
we're not here to help you.

244
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,217
I see.

245
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,354
Why are you so engrossed with this?

246
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,226
I'm not engrossed. I'm just worried.

247
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,062
You mean you don't trust Mr. Akagi?
Because he didn't answer his phone?

248
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:10,963
No, I don't mean…

249
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,898
-That's exactly what you mean.
-No!

250
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,733
Guys, stop fighting.

251
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,972
I don't want to regret anymore…

252
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,808
just because I give up something half way.

253
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,980
I want to watch something
I've been involved in to its end.

254
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,585
Sorry, I know you've taken the trouble
to come and stop me.

255
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,721
Thank you.

256
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,725
Will you be happy
if you have had a look at her?

257
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,061
Yes?

258
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,864
Sneak a peek at the girl
and her mom playing in the garden

259
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,300
and be mistaken as a pervert,
will you be happy then?

260
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,306
You're such a nuisance!

261
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,879
You'll treat me
to Banraiken's intestine set meal, okay?

262
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:01,780
Yes?

263
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,049
You'll treat us to the intestine set meal?
Why didn't you say it sooner?

264
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,687
-In for a penny, in for a meal.
-In for a penny, in for a pound?

265
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,656
It's too late to turn back the horse.

266
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,690
It's the ship.

267
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,725
Okay. I'll join, too.

268
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,994
I haven't had the intestine set meal
for a long time.

269
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,498
-Guys, do you know what you're doing?
-I'm sorry…

270
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,666
I couldn't answer my phone.

271
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,635
I didn't get it from your voice message,

272
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,871
What are we doing?
Why are we assembling here?

273
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,179
Guys…

274
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,915
This will actually catch people's eyes.

275
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,151
I mean, even Kayo is here…

276
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,520
The question is how we're going
to break through that.

277
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,655
Let's get someone to be the bait.

278
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,557
-Oh! You'll go.
-Why me?

279
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,493
-What are we doing?
-Choco!

280
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,961
-Shush.
-Kayo!

281
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,597
Kayo, no!

282
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,969
Oh, ma'am? What's the matter?

283
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,672
-Have you eaten yet?
-Yes?

284
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,642
Hang on, ma'am…

285
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,811
I did feed her.

286
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,046
Well done, Kayo! Let's go…

287
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,319
Don't come with us.
Please take care of my grandma.

288
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,220
What?

289
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,193
-Whoa!
-What?

290
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,195
Where is your destination?

291
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,863
Somewhere with computers.

292
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,266
Then where is that?

293
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,370
What? Don't tell me you
didn't plan this. You're such an idiot!

294
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,973
-Hey… What are we doing?
-Shush! What?

295
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,378
I got it.

296
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,914
We can first
go to the pediatrics department.

297
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,682
-What?
-You're right.

298
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,153
-What are you doing?
-Oops…

299
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,291
So? You can't tell me the details,

300
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,027
but you desperately want to know
if the girl is safe?

301
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,262
Even if you have to do
something so stupid?

302
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,333
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,802
I'm sorry…

304
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,937
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,476
-What is her name?
-Yes?

306
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,248
If anything really happens to the girl,
my conscience will torment me.

307
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,684
-Then…
-But…

308
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,654
I cannot reveal the girl's address to you.

309
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,627
I will go to her home and see
how she is doing. Will that be okay?

310
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,898
Thank you!

311
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,501
HIKARI GOTO

312
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,403
Oh, I've found it.

313
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,341
I'm sorry…

314
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,211
The address is…

315
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,715
Oh? It's the address
of the police station.

316
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,218
It says, "taken in by the Numazu
Chuo Police Station."

317
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,490
Don't worry, Keebou.

318
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,526
Isn't it reassuring to know that
she's still at the police station?

319
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,962
But the policeman I asked
didn't know this.

320
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,165
Maybe he has a reason to hide this
from his colleagues.

321
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,502
Well, Mr. Akagi will call us soon.

322
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,070
But…

323
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,039
But this…

324
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,011
I think Hikari dropped it on purpose.

325
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,112
Like a signal for help.

326
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,683
Do you seriously distrust Mr. Akagi?

327
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,419
Frankly…

328
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,354
I think I do.

329
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,823
You really have left us!

330
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,295
We are much closer to Mr. Akagi than you!

331
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,297
-We're ten years closer!
-Ponjara.

332
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,565
Stop fighting, both of you.

333
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,836
He had helped me a lot, too.

334
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,072
I did so much mischief,

335
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,608
yet I was never sent to
the Classification Office.

336
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,742
It was all thanks to Mr. Akagi.

337
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,745
When I told him that I passed
the university entrance exam,

338
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,181
he was so happy that he wept for joy.

339
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,983
Why, then?

340
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,053
-Why don't you trust Mr. Akagi?
-I don't want to doubt him either!

341
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,957
That's why I want to know the truth
as soon as I can.

342
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,498
Guys, sorry for today.

343
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,289
Keebou…

344
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,143
CALLER: MR. SEGAWA

345
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,279
Hello.

346
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,450
It's all right.
I took a day off in lieu today.

347
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,153
Yes?

348
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,823
Do you know what you do
more frequently when you get older?

349
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,127
It's forgetting things
and talking to yourself.

350
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:16,762
So…

351
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,900
I just forget to hang up the phone
and start talking to myself.

352
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,169
Oh…

353
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,139
That's… serious.

354
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,540
Darling…

355
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,980
So, this is me talking to myself.

356
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:36,982
Okay?

357
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,087
Oh, hang on… Please wait a minute.

358
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:46,658
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,727
Would you repeat that?

360
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,362
What you said to yourself.

361
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,798
Okay.

362
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,170
569-1 Minami Ishihara.

363
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,472
What are you doing, dad?

364
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,174
What if he uses it for some evil purpose?

365
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,778
You are deceived by him!
And by this woman, too!

366
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,783
<i>He was a well-known gangster in this area.</i>

367
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,086
This woman hid this fact
and made advances to you!

368
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,257
You have been deceived all these years!

369
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,196
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,734
I'm sorry, darling, I…

371
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,570
I knew this.

372
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,273
Of course I knew that.

373
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,077
What?

374
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,081
Naturally, I did.

375
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,218
<i>There would be something wrong</i>
<i>with me if I didn't.</i>

376
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,087
And Kiichi, too…

377
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,156
I knew very well

378
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,061
how much effort he had put in

379
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,730
turning his mother's lie into the truth.

380
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,765
I do know this.

381
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,637
<i>What a man he is.</i>

382
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,443
<i>I am happy and fortunate</i>
<i>to have a son like him.</i>

383
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,984
<i>Have you heard that, Kiichi?</i>

384
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:22,854
This…

385
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,258
I wasn't talking to myself just now, okay?

386
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,129
Okay.

387
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,432
Thank you!

388
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,568
Mr. Segawa.

389
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,073
Dad.

390
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,816
Darling…

391
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,320
What was that?

392
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,559
Having a son like him?
Then what am I to you? Who am I?

393
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,596
People make a laughing stock out of me
because of him!

394
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,700
-That's why I--
-How did you fight when facing that?

395
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,469
Are you telling me to fight with others?
I'm not like him!

396
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,105
Fighting with people isn't the only
way to fight.

397
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,475
I'm not telling you
to fight with the bullies.

398
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,781
In order to get the life you want,

399
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,585
what have you done?

400
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,058
Yuta!

401
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,768
Are you going out?

402
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,237
What are you here for?

403
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,207
-We'll go to look for her home.
-Yes?

404
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,377
In the end we're just like you.

405
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,280
We don't want to give up half way.

406
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,483
We'll watch something
we've been involved in to its end.

407
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,623
Guys…

408
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,726
RITOU

409
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,047
I'm sorry, Toru.

410
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,284
I'm sorry…

411
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,662
Don't do something
that you have to apologize for!

412
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,830
Oh, my god!

413
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,199
-Watch it, idiot!
-You're too noisy!

414
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,200
Oh? That's…

415
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,636
Oh?

416
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,075
-Thanks, guys.
-Thanks, sir.

417
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,657
<i>What do I have to do to make you remember?</i>

418
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,261
This is bad.

419
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,763
I don't have much time left!

420
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,370
For someone in shock it's best to…

421
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:28,640
make them shocked again!

422
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,511
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

423
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,447
Hey…

424
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,320
Is this really the place, Tenten?

425
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,221
Yeah.

426
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,457
It's like somewhere
in the Japanese legends.

427
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,226
The car GPS says it's here.

428
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,463
Oh?

429
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,565
-I think it's that house.
-What?

430
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,940
She is living in a house like that?

431
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,543
Somehow this feels suspicious.

432
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,317
-What is he doing?
-Hold him down!

433
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,652
What are you doing?

434
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,987
Let me go!

435
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,356
What? A compass?

436
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,257
-It brings back memories.
-Let go.

437
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,359
-Have you got a protractor?
-Let go!

438
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,362
-Let go…
-Yuta? Why are you here?

439
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,065
Do you know him?

440
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,400
He's my younger brother.

441
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,935
Younger brother?

442
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,537
-Seriously?
-What's the matter, Yuta?

443
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,738
Why are you here?

444
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,778
Why are you here? Are you going to
steal from the family or rob them?

445
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,214
Why?

446
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,049
Why did dad speak so highly

447
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,552
-of a scum like you?
-Shut up!

448
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,389
Scum is someone who uses this in a fight!

449
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,291
I need a weapon
to fight with a former gangster.

450
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,259
It's the handicap I should have.

451
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,060
Yuta…

452
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,064
-A car is coming! Let's hide!
-Okay.

453
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,999
Whoa.

454
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,268
What? Are you running away?

455
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,337
Watch out!

456
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,176
Tagawa?

457
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,312
Why is Tagawa here?

458
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,347
Are they in this together?

459
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,583
Tagawa and Mr. Akagi.

460
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,885
Don't be silly! How is that possible?

461
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,721
But if that's the case…

462
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,391
Then it makes sense.

463
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,971
We still haven't found it.

464
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,040
Maybe it isn't here.

465
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,341
Let's move it to somewhere else.

466
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,676
It'll put the police on our trail
if we stay here.

467
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,079
Gosh!

468
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,481
They've left me to stay behind again?

469
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,622
They are keeping a close watch
on the place.

470
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,260
Who are those guys?

471
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,663
They're not Tagawa's underlings.

472
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,532
Guys, look at the second floor.

473
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,037
Mr. Akagi!

474
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,675
Well, maybe they brought Mr. Akagi here
by force…

475
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,278
or maybe not.

476
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,322
Hey! Stop running!

477
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,992
Are they really doing this together?

478
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,394
The police and gangsters, huh?

479
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,631
What is that nonsense?
Of course it's impossible…

480
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,304
What are you doing?
Casing the joint before you steal?

481
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,806
I'll tell dad…

482
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,877
-What are you doing?
-Toru!

483
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,082
Guys, this is bad.

484
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:00,852
Keebou, Mikki.

485
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,254
Go.

486
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,123
Hikari might be there.

487
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,424
We'll deal with the small fry.

488
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,765
Who are you?

489
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,566
Who are you?

490
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,368
I am myself…

491
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,404
Ow…

492
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,174
-I'll leave this to you.
-We'll take care of this.

493
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,690
Come here!

494
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,496
You're joking…

495
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,365
of course not.

496
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,868
What are you doing there, Ponjara?

497
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,869
It's impossible!

498
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,104
Mr. Akagi won't…

499
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,974
Then let's go and find out!

500
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,443
We'll ask Mr. Akagi about this.

501
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,561
Those idiots…

502
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,065
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

503
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,891
Hikari!

504
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,827
Hikari, are you here?

505
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,195
Answer me if you are!

506
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,600
Hikari, don't be defeated!

507
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,237
As long as you don't admit defeat,
you're on your way to win!

508
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,177
-Be quiet!
-Keebou!

509
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,582
Don't be defeated until you win, Hikari!

510
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,750
Keebou!

511
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,793
-Keebou!
-Hikari… Hikari!

512
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,068
-Keebou!
-Hikari!

513
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,037
Keebou!

514
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,039
Keebou!

515
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,041
-Keebou!
-Hikari!

516
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,177
Keebou!

517
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,378
Go, Keebou!

518
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,986
Go away, Chancellor.

519
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,722
-Back out of this.
-What?

520
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,926
Your opponent is too strong.
I'm telling you for your own good.

521
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,227
Don't get near that kid.

522
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,965
-I'll decide it myself.
-Don't you dare!

523
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,603
-Don't come here!
-Keebou…

524
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,438
Mr. Akagi!

525
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,943
If you get any closer I'll kill the kid.

526
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,848
What are you doing, Mr. Akagi?

527
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,184
Mr. Akagi…

528
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,954
You used to tell us, didn't you?

529
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,123
That we can fight,

530
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,558
but we can't use violence.

531
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,729
I am stupid,

532
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,465
but I have never forgotten that.

533
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,468
But…

534
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,271
But why are you doing this, Mr. Akagi?

535
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,879
Yeah. I used to do that.

536
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,217
I used to be at your beck and call,

537
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,353
you stupid brats!

538
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,225
You know,

539
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,294
I have a daughter, too.

540
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,865
She was adorable when she was your age.

541
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,635
She told me that

542
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,471
she would marry me when she grew up.

543
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,374
However…

544
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,212
Not long after that,
she wouldn't even look at me in the eye.

545
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,448
She conspired with my wife,

546
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,653
and treated me like stinky rubbish.

547
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,290
She told me I should die for my job,

548
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,660
because she would get
the compensation money.

549
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,362
It's horrible, isn't it?

550
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,332
Mr. Akagi…

551
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,202
I don't want to fight with you.

552
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:46,771
I won't.

553
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,006
Keebou,

554
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,642
can't you see this?

555
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,478
The moment you shoot,

556
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,915
-you're destined to lose.
-What crap are you saying?

557
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,487
A cop's gun only has five bullets, right?

558
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,259
There are six of us here.

559
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,662
Even if you shoot us dead one by one,

560
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,999
the one who survives will get Hikari out

561
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,968
and hand you over to the police.

562
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,903
It's simple.

563
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,079
You still haven't changed, Keebou.

564
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,618
What is the point of my life?

565
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,688
What little there is of my salary
is all spent by others,

566
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,758
my wife and child look down on me…

567
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,929
But they keep spending all my money,

568
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,999
spending every penny I've saved.

569
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,102
I have no dream and no hope.

570
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,170
Mr. Akagi…

571
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,308
But it suddenly came to me.

572
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,145
A chance to start my life again.

573
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,514
Why wouldn't I do it?

574
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,683
Of course I'd do it! It's a lot of money!

575
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,853
Mr. Akagi, you're joking, right?

576
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,921
You do this for money?

577
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:15,326
You do such horrible thing just for money?

578
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,296
What else can there be?

579
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,467
Frankly, only money matters!
Everything is about money!

580
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,904
Listen. Remember this.

581
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,308
People say that money
can't buy everything, but it's a lie!

582
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,375
You can buy everything!

583
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,945
Friendship, love… Everything!

584
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,848
But on the contrary,

585
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,451
if you have no money all of these…

586
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,087
just run away and disappear.

587
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,959
You said this when you referred me
for my job,

588
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,264
that although the salary is low,
money isn't everything!

589
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,702
Because there is something
that only I can do in the job!

590
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,605
It was a lie, of course.

591
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,542
I was acting cool.

592
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,511
I wanted to act cool!

593
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,215
I wanted to be cool

594
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,384
at least in front of you!

595
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,520
Mr. Akagi…

596
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,524
I wanted to be like you!

597
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,694
I wanted to become you,
that's why I have kept working till today!

598
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,638
Don't be so frank, Mr. Akagi.

599
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,375
What?

600
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,345
You acted cool in front of us once,
didn't you?

601
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,915
An adult who acted cool once

602
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,851
shouldn't be so frank.

603
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,089
Mr. Akagi, a cool adult…

604
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,492
is our light.

605
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,128
To us, when we were kids,

606
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,164
you were the light that shone on darkness.

607
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,700
You were our guide!

608
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,339
Please keep on doing the job
for the rest of your life!

609
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,509
You were once our light, weren't you?

610
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,113
Then keep the fighting spirit
and act cool for the rest of your life!

611
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,150
What's wrong with you, Mr. Akagi?

612
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,019
Don't be frank about something so stupid!

613
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,222
Don't put out the light
that we used to believe in!

614
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,993
Act cool! Keep acting cool for us!

615
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,231
Shut up!

616
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,877
You didn't put any bullets in it, did you?

617
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,081
The Mr. Akagi I know

618
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,452
can't point a loaded gun at a kid.

619
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,453
That's who he is.

620
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,056
He is not here anymore.

621
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,293
That Mr. Akagi is not here!

622
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,394
Keebou!

623
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,488
I knew you were Mr. Akagi.

624
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,712
Ponjara.

625
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,748
Do your best in your job.

626
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,455
I will.

627
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,997
Gosh, these guys are persistent!

628
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,133
It's fine, guys.

629
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,906
You can go home now. You're dismissed.

630
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,341
Mr. Akagi!

631
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,576
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,146
I made you work extra
for the amount you got.

633
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:31,715
Mr. Akagi…

634
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,689
We didn't help you for the money.

635
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,560
It's because we owe you so much,

636
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,962
that we can never repay you.

637
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,731
I knew it.

638
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,900
They are all people

639
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,703
who Mr. Akagi had helped.

640
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,350
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

641
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,119
Yuta.

642
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,456
Don't tell dad and mom about today.

643
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,357
I…

644
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,492
I still hate to fight with others.

645
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,028
I see.

646
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,365
So I will find my own way to fight.

647
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,235
So that I can get the life I want.

648
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,172
Okay.

649
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,776
Who are you?

650
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,481
I am…

651
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:39,883
myself.

652
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,966
When I heard your voice, Keebou,

653
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,169
I felt warm inside.

654
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,506
My heart…

655
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,476
was racing.

656
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,613
Oh, did you?

657
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:14,451
When I heard you call my name,
this place… felt warm, too.

658
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,089
That's called romance.

659
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,959
What the heck are you saying?
It's not, idiot.

660
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,862
Then what is it?

661
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,765
-What is it…
-What is it?

662
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,366
What?

663
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,907
It's the bond between us.

664
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,879
Wow, you're acting cool, aren't you?

665
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,548
-I'm going to kiss you.
-Shut it!

666
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:45,949
What are you planning to do?

667
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,053
She can stay at my place.

668
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,557
I'm in the shop during the day,
and people can see my shop.

669
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,859
My grandma loves children, too.

670
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,028
Is it okay?

671
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,764
In for a penny, in for a meal.
Right, Ponjara?

672
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,700
-Yeah.
-It's "pound".

673
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,702
-Too late to turn back the horse!
-It's "ship"!

674
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,903
I've told you many times!
You're so stupid!

675
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,638
I don't care anyway!

676
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,293
"Sales department".

677
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:47,845
PREVIEW OF NEXT EPISODE

678
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,214
Keebou was taken away!

679
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,682
Isn't the matter going to
keep getting more serious?

680
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,716
What can you do

681
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,118
for Keebou right now?

682
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,353
No one will come to save me.

683
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,188
We're friends

684
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,358
because we want to help each other out.
