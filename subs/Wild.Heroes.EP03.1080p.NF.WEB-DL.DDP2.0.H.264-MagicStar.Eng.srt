1
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,979
-Let's go.
-He's so cute!

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,080
-Thanks.
-Hello…

3
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,185
Papy!

4
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,491
You don't have to work
as a police dog today, so relax!

5
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,834
KIICHI SEGAWA

6
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,104
Please call if you're interested.

7
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,910
Yes!

8
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,678
MIKI TIRES

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,313
-You're early.
-I came straight from work.

10
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,816
-Sorry to have kept you waiting.
-Welcome, Keebou!

11
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,451
-Thanks.
-Hey!

12
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,219
Oh.

13
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,289
-Why?
-I don't know. Why are you here?

14
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,858
You can let her stay the night here too.

15
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,461
That would be asking too much
of you, but thanks.

16
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,098
Thank you, too, Kayo.

17
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,367
Look, Keebou.

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,103
What have you made? A rabbit?

19
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,939
It's scary!

20
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,475
-It's a female demon.
-It's a female demon.

21
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,544
And we had stewed beef for lunch!

22
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,846
Kayo made it for you?

23
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:53,813
Mikki did.

24
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,548
I'm impressed.

25
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
It was absolutely delicious.

26
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,318
-Was it?
-Yeah.

27
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,988
But I like the fried eggs you make too.

28
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,323
-Do you?
-Yeah.

29
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,858
It's all right,
don't worry about hurting my feelings.

30
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,226
Keebou, this…

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,030
How may I help you?

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,902
Mr. Segawa!

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,838
-Why?
-This is my home.

34
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,574
Oh, no! I got the wrong place.

35
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,777
-I was wondering why I can't open it.
-Actually, that isn't the question.

36
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,779
You…

37
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,983
I just moved here today.

38
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,417
Seriously?

39
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,254
-Yes.
-Wow, it's a miracle! Like in a drama.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,023
This isn't a coincidence
you see in a drama nowadays.

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,957
Oh…

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,326
Oh!

43
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,296
Is she the girl
you were looking for the other day?

44
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,931
Yes, she is.

45
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,866
Sorry for the trouble we caused that day.

46
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,935
I'm glad to know she is safe.

47
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,538
Hello.

48
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,640
Hello.

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,610
Are you living with her?

50
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,380
There is a reason for that.

51
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,250
Owing to the complicated circumstances,

52
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,052
we have to live together.

53
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,327
What do you want for supper?
Anything you want?

54
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,663
Oh!

55
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,098
Shall I invite our neighbor?

56
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,301
To celebrate her house move.

57
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,004
Oh?

58
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,708
She has come to invite us for dinner?

59
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,410
Well, of course not…

60
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,580
Mr. Kiichi Segawa?

61
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,415
Yes.

62
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,751
I'm an officer
from Numazu Chuo Police Station.

63
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,221
Yes?

64
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,297
It's already so late?

65
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,801
Please stay a bit longer.

66
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,403
I'm so lonely.

67
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,741
When you're with me
you're still lonely anyway.

68
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,881
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,885
-The formula of loneliness.
-What?

70
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,222
It's more lonely when you're with me
and you want to leave

71
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,260
than when we're apart
but you are thinking of me.

72
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,028
What did you say?

73
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,611
Frankly, I don't get this.
I have never understood.

74
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,248
Understand what?

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,119
Stuff like loneliness.

76
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,222
Are you not lonely when I'm not with you?

77
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,460
If I say I'm not lonely
you'll tell me you'll die again.

78
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,895
Don't phrase it like that.

79
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,931
Are you not lonely?

80
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,101
-Yes, I am.
-<i>The body found was…</i>

84
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,834
There you are!

85
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,703
Have you seen the television?

86
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,272
There is no way I have watched the TV,
is there, Manager?

87
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,841
-He was killed!
-What?

88
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,444
The policeman
who referred you to this job.

89
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,214
<i>Pichan, please let me buy it!</i>

90
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,349
Please!

91
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,319
But Saya, do you use ventriloquism?

92
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,221
VENTRILOQUISM PUPPET, CHAPPY

93
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,489
Yes I do!

94
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,627
I will practice it! I'll work very hard.

95
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,531
But you can use the nutcracker to do this.
Its mouth can move.

96
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,402
You're right.

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,672
Its mouth can move.

98
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,176
It clicks when it moves.

99
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,512
To me this is already…

100
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,081
enough.

101
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,253
Okay, got it. Buy it then.

102
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,823
Thank you, Pichan! I love you!

103
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,528
Do you love me, Pichan?

104
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,397
Silly!

105
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,800
-I really love you.

I'm home.

110
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,811
-Have you heard, Noriaki?
-Yes?

111
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,981
There was a murder
on the embankment in front of us.

112
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,048
Seriously?

113
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,251
A customer told me just now.

114
00:06:59,051 --> 00:06:59,886
And the killer?

115
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,888
They haven't caught the killer.

116
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,757
Is it someone in the neighborhood?

117
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,160
Oh, no, Noriaki. It's scary!

118
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,430
Don't worry. They'll find
the murderer soon.

119
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:19,105
You'll protect me and the children
because you're strong, right?

120
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,477
I say,

121
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,046
have you got nowhere else to go?

122
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,249
It's boring here.

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,289
-But…
-You got in my way…

124
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,761
You…

125
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,731
How did you and those guys become friends?

126
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,034
-You mean Keebou and the others?
-Yeah.

127
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,537
How did we become friends?

128
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,473
We just became friends.

129
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,310
How do you just become friends?

130
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,647
What's wrong?

131
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,651
Keebou… Keebou was…

132
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,288
-So what is wrong?
-The police took him away!

133
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,725
I'll ask you again.

134
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,661
Why was this found at the crime scene?

135
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,665
KIICHI SEGAWA

136
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,806
What? You're cocky enough
to use your right to remain silent?

137
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,177
-Is it true?
-What?

138
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,282
Was Mr. Akagi really killed?

139
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,453
Darn!

140
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:42,955
Why…

141
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,691
Why was Mr. Akagi…

142
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,697
Is it possible that…

143
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,067
It was because he let us go?

144
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,105
If that's the case…

145
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,774
Does that mean Tagawa did it?

146
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,078
Ponjara!

147
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,547
Where are you going?

148
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,616
Where else? To find Tagawa.

149
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,651
This is stupid.

150
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,386
-Shut up!
-Calm down!

151
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,389
-What will you do then?
-But…

152
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,424
Mr. Akagi doesn't want us to do that.

153
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,362
I don't think Tagawa did it.

154
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,398
At that time

155
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,135
Mr. Akagi seemed to be
ordering Tagawa around. Also,

156
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,573
the body was found somewhere else,
it was too elaborate for him.

157
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,445
So, Mr. Akagi was killed by someone
who hired him?

158
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,682
If so…

159
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,786
We should be careful too.

160
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,358
Hey!

161
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,527
Don't come to my place anymore.

162
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,562
Why?

163
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,830
You're not one of us.

164
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,799
Stay away from other people's business.

165
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,009
Hey!

166
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,718
Mikki… You didn't have to be so harsh.

167
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,122
Really, that's what I think
is not so good about you.

168
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,391
He's still a kid.

169
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,460
I don't want to get him
involved in this any further.

170
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,364
Then you should have said so
at the beginning. There you go.

171
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,767
-Really?
-Yeah.

172
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,769
I'll text him later.

173
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,774
When did you exchange email
addresses with the kid?

174
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,543
What?

175
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:46,579
You didn't?

176
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,747
Choco!

177
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,217
You're finally popular with guys, too?

178
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,586
Hikari.

179
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,490
Don't worry, Hikari.

180
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,494
He was not arrested so he will come back.

181
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,864
On top of that Keebou didn't do anything,

182
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,999
so it's safer for him to
stay with the police.

183
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,670
If the worst happens
we will all testify for him.

184
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,805
Don't worry!

185
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,607
The Japanese police are not idiots.

186
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,377
You killed him, didn't you?

187
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,812
You were looking for Mr. Akagi

188
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,747
while he was on his holiday, weren't you?

189
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,684
We have conclusive evidence.

190
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,586
That's impossible.

191
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,124
What do you want?

192
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,761
I'm going home. You asked me
to come voluntarily, didn't you?

193
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,863
So I can go at any time I want.

194
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,304
-Please go away.
-Try getting him away.

195
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,474
I'll arrest you for obstructing the police
in the execution of their duties.

196
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,845
What the heck?

197
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,280
Sit down now!

198
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:01,020
I'll tell you
what killing a policeman means to us…

199
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,724
very thoroughly.

200
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,530
<i>About the murder happened today</i>
<i>in which a policeman was strangled,</i>

201
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:16,368
<i>the police are investigating</i>
<i>what Tatsuhiko Akagi was doing beforehand…</i>

202
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,937
Boss! People from head office are here!

203
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,146
Tagawa, I have called in.

204
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,456
Bring him here.

205
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,793
-But he was brought back by the police…
-Bring him here.

206
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,962
I said he was pulled in…

207
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,100
Tagawa.

208
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,737
You are as dull as the beer.

209
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,175
It seems that you still don't understand…

210
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,746
This is the reason I come here.

211
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,884
If he got the kid, Tagawa…

212
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,820
I won't let you get away with it easily.

213
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,624
The policeman was killed, you know?

214
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,193
Have some awareness

215
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,395
of a crisis situation.

216
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,203
-Can you manage?
-Yeah.

217
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,075
What's the matter? Come in.

218
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,150
Hikari?

219
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,654
Was it my fault?

220
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,726
Was it my fault that the policeman
was killed?

221
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,697
Of course not.

222
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,101
Was it also my fault
that Keebou was caught?

223
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,572
-If you stay with me you'll also…
-Hikari!

224
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,210
I'll tell you…

225
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,681
what you can do for Keebou now.

226
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,484
You have to be cheerful.

227
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,422
You have to be cheerful and smile.

228
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,462
If you're not smiling
when Keebou comes back, he'll be sad.

229
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,369
Come on, come inside.

230
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,839
Fold origami with Grandma again tomorrow.

231
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,945
Okay?

232
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,782
Good.

233
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,385
Come in.

234
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,630
MIKI TIRES

<i>Don't come to my place anymore.</i>

237
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,321
You're not one of us.

238
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,396
What's wrong? What's happened?

239
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,598
Just now…

240
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,301
A strange man came…

241
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,004
-and stole my bra.
-Your bra?

242
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,411
Thief!

243
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,914
Stop, pervert!

244
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,583
Pervert! Give me back the bra!

245
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,862
Bra…

246
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,231
This is… a bra.

247
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,434
You…

248
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,708
I said, I didn't do it.

249
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,676
Then who did it?

250
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,011
I don't know!

251
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,622
Brace up. We can stay here
for a long time.

252
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,563
Good morning.

253
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,598
I am his lawyer,

254
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,801
my name is Odajima.

255
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,304
Oh?

256
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,207
How do you explain this?

257
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,251
Keebou has not come back.

258
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,353
No…

259
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,055
What is he doing?

260
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,168
Okay! Let's go somewhere.

261
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,705
For a change of mood.

262
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,140
-But the shop…
-I'll skip work.

263
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,475
I don't get many customers anyway.

264
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,180
Where do you want to go?

265
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,621
Thank you for helping me!

266
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,689
Thank you.

267
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,026
They can't compel you to stay
if you came voluntarily.

268
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,228
That was totally against the law.

269
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,331
And they were interrogating you
in a threatening manner.

270
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,167
It's something reckless that only
the police in the old days did.

271
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,336
But why have you come for me?

272
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,674
Your friends asked me to come.

273
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,342
They have paid me as well.

274
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,011
What? Really?

275
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,548
Those guys… They even did that?

276
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,184
-I'm sorry.
-Now, now.

277
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,186
Don't be ridiculous!
Are you looking down on me?

278
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,987
I told you!

279
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,124
I just went to take the bra back
from a pervert!

280
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,192
It was our fault.

281
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,027
This is the so-called false accusation.

282
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,830
I'll write about it on Twitter!

283
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,031
-We're sorry…
-Toru?

284
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,301
Oh? Keebou?

METROPOLITAN POLICE STATION

286
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,305
They were accusing the innocent!

287
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,906
How dare the policemen look down on me?

288
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,708
Hey…

289
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,343
Anyway, just put that away somewhere.

Mr. Segawa, please get in.
I'll drive you back.

292
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,783
Thank you for doing so much.

293
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,487
-So, I…
-I'll drive you back too. Please get in.

294
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,255
You'll do that?

295
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:44,890
Thanks!

296
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,592
Thank you.

297
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,063
Hey, my friend.

298
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,948
MIKI TIRES

299
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,088
Are you okay?

300
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,026
You don't have to force yourself
to remember.

301
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,672
-Mikki.
-Yes?

302
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,743
Where are your parents?

303
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,512
-Mine?
-Yeah.

304
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,384
My dad died and my mom ran away.

305
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,323
Before Grandma became like this,

306
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,391
she was a frank person,

307
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,694
and she used to say everything
on her mind.

308
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,462
She meant no harm though.

309
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,700
My mom couldn't stand her.

310
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,770
-So she ran away from home?
-No.

311
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,575
She ran away from home
after Grandma became like this.

312
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,745
She thought it was her fault
that Grandma went senile.

313
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,314
Her conscious kept blaming her
when she saw Grandma,

314
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,482
and she wanted to die.

315
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,218
She said…

316
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,754
If this continued…

317
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,458
She would either kill herself or Grandma.

318
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,963
You can't do anything about that.

319
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,699
If that's what she thinks

320
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,637
nothing can be done,
no matter what the other says.

321
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,376
-But what about you, Mikki?
-Yes?

322
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,481
Are you fine with this?

323
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,220
I love both Grandmas.

324
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,456
Even though she has forgotten
lots of things?

325
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,891
Yes, even so.

326
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,460
Because she is my grandma.

327
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,707
Let him go. He is not involved in this.

328
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,709
Please, Mr. Tagawa.

329
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,312
I can't just say, "Oh, he isn't?"
and let him go, can I?

330
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,346
Mr. Tagawa!

331
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,283
It's too late to do that.

332
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,619
Too late?

333
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,355
That's why I told you to back out of this.

334
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,602
Hikari! Where have you been?

335
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,637
Hikari!

336
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,540
What a relief!

337
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,875
I'm so glad to see you here.

338
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,645
I've been so worried about you.

339
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,213
But you're all right, aren't you?

340
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,783
I'm really relieved…

341
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,822
Excuse me, who are you?

342
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,925
That is my line. Who are you?

343
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,270
Hello and welcome.

344
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,176
Hey!

345
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,045
Subcontractors should go out
and keep watch.

346
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,880
Yes, sir.

347
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,668
Where is the kid?

348
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,405
Where have you hidden her?

349
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,707
Things keep repeating themselves,
seriously.

350
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,211
Sorry I keep repeating my answer,
but I don't know.

351
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,080
I heard…

352
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,316
your tolerance of pain was high.

353
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,898
Is she at your friend's place?

354
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,201
I heard you were a local.

355
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,905
There are friends you hang out with,
aren't there?

356
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,176
Did you let her stay at someone's place?

357
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,916
Toru! Stop it!

358
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,319
I'll easily find that out
if I do some digging.

359
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,122
If you aren't talking,

360
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,059
I'll find them out
and ruin their homes one by one.

361
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,496
No! None of them knows this!
He knows nothing, too!

362
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,064
Please let us go!

363
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,500
You're so annoyingly noisy.

364
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,644
Hikari has lost her memory?

365
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,548
Her parents have disappeared too.

366
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,784
It must have been scary for you.

367
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,256
I'm sorry.

368
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:56,261
I'm your class teacher, Ms. Sawako.

369
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,931
Ms. Sawako…

370
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,899
That's right.

371
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,536
I've been your teacher since you
were transferred here last spring.

372
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,005
Oh, right.

373
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,443
Look.

374
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,978
This was taken
when we went hiking last year.

375
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,579
You see?

376
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,687
So who are you?

377
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,389
Who am I?

378
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,025
Well, it's hard to explain…

379
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,730
Hikari, come with me to the school

380
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,265
and talk about what we'll do after that.

381
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:40,739
I will bring her back
and take care of her.

382
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,277
Well, my friend asked me
to take care of her,

383
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,845
I'll ask him before letting her
go with you.

384
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:47,913
Please call him now.

385
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,447
But it's a bit difficult…

386
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,149
-Why?
-He's at the police station.

387
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,951
Police?

388
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,356
Anyway…

389
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,526
I will take her with me for now.

390
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,462
Please call me after you call your friend,
and confirm it's okay.

391
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,299
Is that all right?

392
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,199
SAWAKO FUJISHIRO

393
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,440
Can I call your school?

394
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,442
Go ahead.

395
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,415
Toru!

396
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,184
It's too early to sleep, boy!

397
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,562
We'll have a break.

398
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,640
Toru!

399
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,843
Toru!

400
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,019
-Are you all right?
-I'm not all right.

401
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,756
I'm sorry for getting you involved.

402
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:07,492
I see.

403
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,461
Thank you.

404
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,103
You believe me now?

405
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,538
Yes. Sorry about that.

406
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,342
It's okay. I was rude as well.

407
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,447
You let Hikari stay with you,
but the words I said were so harsh.

408
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,516
I was worrying about her, that's why I…

409
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,021
If you have to give a child
over to a stranger,

410
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,757
you should be as careful as you were.

411
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,159
It's all right.

412
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,963
Hikari, come with me.

413
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,803
You're bringing the gentleman trouble.

414
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,373
You can't keep bringing trouble
to people who aren't close to you.

415
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,179
You didn't bring us trouble. Not at all.

416
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,695
Are you sure?

417
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,238
See you, Kayo.

418
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,107
See you!

419
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,076
Take care.

420
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,822
-Darn! Okay…
-Get a good one.

421
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,292
They won't kill us, will they?

422
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,461
What?

423
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,229
They will kill us?

424
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,871
Who is calling at this hour?

425
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,407
You…

426
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,881
Quick!

427
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,516
Turn your back to me.

428
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,263
Keebou, not that one.

429
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,098
I know! Idiot!

430
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,405
Yes. Can I kill them?

431
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,675
Well, it's going to be the same anyway.

432
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,577
Yeah.

433
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,179
-Tagawa!
-Yes?

434
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,747
Keep an eye on them inside.

435
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,996
You lost. 100,000 yen.

436
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,433
Wow, the bra is nice.

437
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,334
Hey.

438
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,436
Get it using your foot.

439
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,374
Slowly.

440
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,449
Oh, you look so pitiable.

441
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,592
What's wrong with you?

442
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,028
Your contact list is so short!

443
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,065
You pretend to be cool
but you actually have no friends?

444
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,242
Who are you going to call
when you have no friends?

445
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,525
You haven't got friends?

446
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:01,893
No.

447
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,062
I don't need friends.

448
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,999
-Friends only betray you.
-Toru…

449
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,201
I have no friend
who will come to rescue me.

450
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,202
Don't get this wrong.

451
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,106
You don't think of people as friends
because they help you.

452
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,810
You think of them as friends
because you want to help them.

453
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,200
TEACHER, SAWAKO FUJISHIRO

454
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,870
Hey!

455
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,705
What's up, Choco?

456
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,574
My customer gave me
a piece of chocolate cake.

457
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,409
But Choco can't eat chocolate.

458
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,578
Yeah, so I've brought it here for Hikari.

459
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:55,980
Oh?

460
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,548
Where is Hikari?

461
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,620
I was hesitant about letting Hikari
go with her without asking Keebou.

462
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,692
But I guess it's safer that way
than staying with us, because they know

463
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,160
who we are and where we live.

464
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,896
Well, you're right about that.

465
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,734
Speaking of which,
he has still not been released…

466
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,003
Will he be all right?

467
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,675
But as Tenten said,

468
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,244
maybe it's safer for him
to be at the police station now.

469
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,115
What is actually going on?

470
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,721
Isn't the matter going to
keep getting more serious?

471
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,790
Yeah.

472
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,296
Anyway, I'll text the guys about Hikari.

473
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,200
Oh.

474
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,868
I've got a text from the stupid kid.

475
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,769
You mean Toru?

476
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,706
What? He is lonely already?

477
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,275
What is this?

478
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,453
I'll get the guys' attention.

479
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,522
-You try to find some way to run away.
-But what about you?

480
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,291
Don't be defeated…

481
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:14,892
Toru.

482
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,297
Don't be defeated until you win.

483
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,781
Idiot! Don't mind me, just go!

484
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,083
You said someone is my friend
because I want to help them.

485
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,251
Just go!

486
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,553
Hey!

487
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,022
What are you doing?

488
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,323
-Run, idiot!
-How dare you?

489
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,826
You know what the consequences are.

490
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,330
Brat!

491
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,834
Mr. Tagawa, please!

492
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,836
Please let him go!

493
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,307
I can't do that, even though
it's a request from my friend.

494
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,045
Stay still.

495
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,948
I think the guys will come soon.

496
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,854
I sent his photo
along with your location to them.

497
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,458
This is my territory.

498
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,895
They act too self-importantly here
and it's humiliating.

499
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,965
Then do something more helpful!

500
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,267
This is not helping much.

501
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:30,935
Oh, shut up.

502
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,439
This is the most I can do.

503
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,542
Chancellor.

504
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,511
Thanks.

505
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,121
Don't worry.

506
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,123
They won't come.

507
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,227
-Why?
-It was my phone and where I am.

508
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,697
-They won't come.
-They will.

509
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,100
If he sent a photo of you
beaten-up so badly.

510
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,334
They would if it were your photo.

511
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:05,837
But I…

512
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:09,807
I'm not one of them.

513
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,578
Why? You are our friends.

514
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,979
No, I'm not.

515
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:17,882
He made it clear.

516
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,889
Let's make a bet.

517
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,557
Yes?

518
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,760
An intestine set meal.

519
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,329
Do you want to bet?

520
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,332
-That's cheap.
-They will come.

521
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,501
They will.

522
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,569
I'm sure about that.

523
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,638
Of course they won't come here.

524
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,908
They'll never come here
for someone like me!

525
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,716
What are you mumbling?

526
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,121
Let's begin our second round.

527
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,862
THE ORION

528
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,232
-Great picture.
-I'll do the next one.

529
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,272
Hey!

530
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,941
He really doesn't know anything.

531
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,178
He has nothing to do with us,
find it out from me.

532
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,446
He can't tell you anything!

533
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,952
No! I told you,
he knows nothing about this.

534
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,889
You know, don't you?

535
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,127
Tell me now.

536
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,496
I'll kill this boy if you don't.

537
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,969
-Do it.
-Yes, sir.

538
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,351
No!

539
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,487
I'll tell you.

540
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,357
-Don't do this to him.
-You'll tell me first.

541
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,160
She is in my apartment.

542
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,497
There is a closet on the rooftop
of my apartment building. She's there.

543
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,900
Are you telling the truth?

544
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,602
I am.

545
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,739
If that was a lie…

546
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,810
I will kill your families, too.

547
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,780
No! She isn't there!

548
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,150
Don't harm our families!

549
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,053
Please…

550
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,257
How dare you…

551
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,759
look down on me?

552
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,333
That means, boy,

553
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,638
you know where the kid is, too, don't you?

554
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,608
Good.

555
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,844
Let's make a deal.

556
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,116
Before I count to five,

557
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,552
I will save the one who tell me
where the kid is first.

558
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,088
And the other one?

559
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,924
I'll bury him.

560
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,961
If both of you don't tell

561
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,897
I'll bury the two of you together.

562
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,732
Then I'll change my plans.

563
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,836
I'll first look for your friends,
and try to get it from them in turn.

564
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,772
I don't even need you two.

565
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,007
-Hang on…
-One…

566
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,014
Say it, Toru. You can tell him.

567
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:40,751
It's okay.

568
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,821
The guys will manage.

569
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,891
Why are you so confident?

570
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,593
Because you are friends?

571
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,897
-Yeah.
-Two!

572
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,665
I don't believe this.

573
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,635
People betray me because I trust them!

574
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,973
Then isn't it easier not to count
on anyone right from the start?

575
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,010
Yes, perhaps.

576
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,313
That's easier.

577
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,815
Three!

578
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,917
That was what I thought

579
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,454
in the ten years that
I was apart from the guys.

580
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,458
But it was really dull.

581
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,930
It's easy when you have no friends,
but it's very boring.

582
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,866
It's boring, but it gives you
more freedom.

583
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,103
That's not the case!

584
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,708
I feel freer…

585
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,911
with them

586
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,247
than on my own.

587
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,515
Four!

588
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,584
Toru.

589
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,353
Have faith in your friends!

590
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,589
No! We are not friends!

591
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,058
None of them needs me!

592
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,827
I have always been…

593
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,631
You're not the one to decide that,
it's us!

594
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,000
"Us"? They're not even coming here!

595
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,037
They won't come! They won't!

596
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,240
Five!

597
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,549
Who the heck are you?

598
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,222
No way!

599
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,925
Why?

600
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,294
Hey, Toru! Are you okay?

601
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,228
Oh?

602
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,864
Keebou! Why are you here?

603
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,635
Really…

604
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,337
They really came for me…

605
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,108
Who did you say you are?

606
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,246
Who are you?

607
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:51,882
I am…

608
00:40:58,823 --> 00:40:59,857
myself!

609
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:14,972
Get out of my way, scum!

610
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,350
Oh, wow, you're here as well, Keebou?

611
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,018
We can kill two birds with one stone!

612
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,222
Stop where you are!

613
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,364
Gosh! Don't cause us trouble. Okay.

614
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,867
-Keebou.
-Thanks.

615
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,651
It's okay. Please go.

616
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,552
Okay.

617
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,094
Thanks for that, Chancellor.

618
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,262
It wasn't much, though.

619
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,900
Aihara, hit me. Now!

620
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,535
-Why?
-He's watching.

621
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,803
He is staring.

622
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,074
I'm sorry.

623
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:28,846
You're in my way!

624
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,326
Mikki…

625
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,965
Sorry, we were late.

626
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,606
He said that he would save us
if we talked,

627
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,175
but the boy didn't talk at all.

628
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,611
-Well done!
-Good boy. You did a great job.

629
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,383
See? I told you they would surely come.

630
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,221
How long are you going to cry?

631
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,323
You're such a cry baby.

632
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,891
Guys, let's go home.

633
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,726
Toru, you owe me an intestine set meal.

634
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,162
That's great. Oh, hold on…

635
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,998
We came to rescue you, Toru!

636
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:21,932
Hey!

637
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:31,742
There you go.

638
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,213
Are you all right, Melos?

639
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,815
I'm all right.

640
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,684
Who is Melos?

641
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,920
-Who else if not you?
-What?

642
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,789
You kept saying that
the guys wouldn't come.

643
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,625
Melos runs, you know.

644
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,832
You're Melos, starting today.

645
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,637
Engrave today's joy in your name.

646
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,775
I will engrave the joy on my heart,
but Melos?

647
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,411
-Let's make it "Bra", shall we?
-I like the name Melos.

648
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,847
Good boy.

649
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,819
So, now you're formally one of us.

650
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,656
We have no choice but to let you join,

651
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,759
because Keebou gave you
a really stupid nickname.

652
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,595
You mean Keebou gave you
all your stupid nicknames?

653
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,063
-Hey…
-Don't say it's stupid.

654
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,031
It's, you know…

655
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,466
The rite of passage.

656
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,202
Gosh, Pi.
The words you used were so difficult.

657
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,203
Can you even spell the words?

658
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:34,772
I can't.

659
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,711
What the heck?

660
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:52,923
I see.

00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,992
Thanks, Mikki.

662
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,527
It's probably best for Hikari.

663
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,629
Sorry for asking you first.

664
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,597
It's okay. That's for the best.

665
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,202
-May I borrow your cellphone?
-Sure.

666
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,338
Thank you.

667
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,510
You're calling her right away?

668
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,814
I guess he wants to hear her voice.

669
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,660
Please answer the phone. I'm busy now.

670
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,296
Come on. Answer it.

671
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,278
<i>Sorry, Keebou.</i>

672
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,447
<i>That woman is no teacher.</i>

673
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,582
Don't kill me.

674
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,283
<i>We received our next order. Let's go.</i>

675
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,219
<i>Didn't it seem a little off?</i>

676
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,353
<i>I understand.</i>

677
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,590
<i>Your words reached my heart.</i>

678
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,058
We'll all go to see you.
