1
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,676
<i>Why are the gangsters after you?</i>

2
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,845
<i>I don't know! I can't remember!</i>

3
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,247
<i>What should I do to make you remember?</i>

4
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>The body found was</i>

5
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,785
<i>Assistant Inspector,</i>
<i>Tatsuhiko Akagi, 56 years old.</i>

6
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,253
Isn't the matter getting more serious?

7
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,255
I am your class teacher,

8
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,756
Sawako Fujishiro.

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,825
<i>This is Segawa. Sorry to bother you again,</i>

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,027
<i>but I'd like to know how Hikari is doing.</i>

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,540
MAUNTO

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,548
Have you seen my husband?

13
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,149
Hang on, what…

14
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,085
Oh? Chairwoman!

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,854
Wait…

16
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,090
You can't come in here!
It's filled with cigarette smoke!

17
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,592
Guys, have you seen my husband?

18
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,493
What?

19
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,129
-No…
-What has he done?

20
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,231
Noriaki ran away from home.

21
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,432
What?

22
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,336
He seems to have always thought that
I was pregnant but not with his children,

23
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,605
so we fought, and…

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,246
"To Momoyo.

25
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,582
I'll go on a journey to make a book…"

26
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,651
Sorry. "…take a look at myself again.

27
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,888
Please don't look for me. By Noriaki."

28
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,894
So we have asked you to make time in
your busy schedules to come here.

29
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,864
But it's impossible,
because she is the Chairwoman.

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,198
The Chairwoman denied it, right?

31
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,566
Who is the Chairwoman?

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,667
She was like the Madonna to us.

33
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,369
When we were at high school.

34
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,270
Madonna…

35
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,374
She is gorgeous, smart and nice.

36
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,442
The exact image of the Madonna.

37
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,344
Then why did she marry Tenten?

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,245
That's…

39
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,081
One of the seven strangest stories
in Numazu.

40
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,683
The marriage between a super idiot
and the class president

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,851
is an urban legend.

42
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,854
So, why did Tenten say that?

43
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,489
It seems that the numbers didn't add up.

44
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,790
What?

45
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,893
He said that he didn't remember
doing the act on the day

46
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,061
when he calculated back from the due date.

47
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,497
I don't accept the reason.

48
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,034
It's impossible. Calculating
backwards is too difficult for him.

49
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,037
Brave Tenten hadn't even learned
his multiplication tables by high school.

50
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,006
The problem isn't
the multiplication tables.

51
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,545
The problem is that he suspects that the
father is one of us.

52
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,046
-What?
-What?

53
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,514
So what,

54
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,149
you mean someone stole his wife?

55
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,418
No way. It's even more unlikely
for the Chairwoman.

56
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,520
I'd like to think so, too.

57
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,156
But he's… I mean,

58
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,959
he's not smart,
but his intuition is acute.

59
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,728
So let's make this clear here.

60
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,163
Crystal clear.

61
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,199
How?

62
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,575
Guys, please close your eyes.

63
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:32,979
Okay.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,349
Raise your hand honestly
if you made a cuckold of Tenten.

65
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,090
So?

66
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,292
If everyone has closed their eyes,
who is going to check?

67
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,193
Oh!

68
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,729
Well, I'll check.

69
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,031
Only I am totally innocent.

70
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,433
Why?

71
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,368
I didn't come back for ten years.

72
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,203
-Does that count as alibi?
-Of course!

73
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,341
I'm the one that's totally innocent.
No matter how you look at it.

74
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,376
Really, this is ridiculous.

75
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,111
I'll go back to work.

76
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,181
Frankly, you're the most suspicious
one, Choco.

77
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,150
-What? Why?
-It's your aura.

78
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,585
You can't accuse me from my aura.

79
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,020
Your aura is impressive, Choco.

80
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,921
Exactly.

81
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,457
His aura has this intense
for a very long time…

82
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,591
Tenten didn't answer?

83
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,227
No, I was calling the teacher
Hikari is staying with.

84
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,330
-You still can't contact her?
-No.

85
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,732
I left a voice message, though.

86
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,334
Maybe she doesn't trust me.

87
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,303
That's it, guys.

88
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,405
Hikari is more important than
a guy running away from home.

89
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,974
-Huh?
-Hikari's case is closed for me.

90
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,310
Her teacher has brought Hikari home,

91
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,078
we'd better not bother them.

92
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,480
I know, but…

93
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,883
I feel uneasy parting from her
without saying goodbye.

94
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,985
She said that she'd bring Hikari
to see us soon, though.

95
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,455
I should have told Hikari your
cellphone number. Sorry.

96
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,990
But speaking of which,

97
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,826
you can't advance your relationship
with an elementary schoolgirl!

98
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,695
That's not what this is, idiot.

99
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,031
Well, I understand you, Keebou.

100
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,966
It's sad, isn't it?

101
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,003
When you break up with a woman
she cries and pleads you not to go.

102
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,738
And a week later…

103
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,641
The feelings you get when you see
her tweet,

104
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,011
"After the sad breakup, I finally
know what true love is."

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,048
I don't think it's the same.

106
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:15,948
Keebou.

107
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,685
Can you take some time off on a weekday?

108
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,886
Yes?

109
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,288
Let's go to Hikari's school
and have a look.

110
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,559
Don't be defeated until you win.

111
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,961
Don't give up until you win.

112
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,832
Don't give up until you win.

113
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,420
<i>You will surely win.</i>

114
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,322
As long as you don't admit defeat,

115
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,691
you're only on your way to
claim your victory.

116
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,735
That…

117
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,872
Will you let me see your whistle?

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,481
I can't see it clearly.

119
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,208
What are you doing?

120
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,779
This is expensive!

121
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,147
Gosh!

122
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:57,984
Please don't kill me.

123
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,354
Don't do that. We can't kill her yet.

124
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,324
Good gracious! I can't even go for
a leisurely walk.

125
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,795
Mommy will take a shower. Make sure
you keep a close eye on her.

126
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,696
Oh, right.

127
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,500
I've bought your whistle candies.

128
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,588
Did you kill the policeman?

129
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,629
Why?

130
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,136
Order.

131
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,040
Order?

132
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,084
Your mom's?

133
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,089
That's awful…

134
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,060
KADOMATSU LIMITED

135
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,364
Keep a close watch on Kiichi Segawa.

136
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,700
Plant it. The micro-sized bug.

137
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,604
You mean plant it on him,
not in his room, don't you?

138
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,040
Plant it. The micro-sized bug.

139
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,709
But if I plant it on him we won't
be able to trace him if he gets changed.

140
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,245
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

141
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,613
Be aware of a crisis, airhead!

142
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,516
Okay.

143
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,953
I said you haven't put enough work
into it.

144
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,923
You have to be creative,
do you understand?

145
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,824
Okay. I'm sorry.

146
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,327
The only thing you can do is smile.

147
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,931
-You're not doing your job…
-Oh, this is lovely! Natto spring roll!

148
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,699
This is very creative.

149
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,035
-You again? Get lost, idiot!
-Manager!

150
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,505
I'm a customer now, so it's rude
to say that to me.

151
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,876
Gosh! All the staff in this
supermarket are idiots!

152
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,210
What is this, the kingdom of idiots?

153
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,051
If this is the kingdom of idiots,
then you're the king of idiots.

154
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,653
MORIYAMA

155
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,889
Thank you, Mr. Watchman.

156
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:51,657
Why?

157
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,828
It's a bit early for this, but…

158
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,930
HALF PRICE

159
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,232
Is that all right?

160
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,667
Don't tell anyone.

161
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,075
Pichan, please! I want to buy this!

162
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,578
Madame Saya, 200,000 yen is
really too much.

163
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,547
But it's on special offer!

164
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,516
Pascal can even sing!

165
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,019
TALKING ROBOT
PASCAL 3RD

166
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,755
But you have Chappy,
the ventriloquist's dummy.

167
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,825
But ventriloquism is difficult!

168
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,793
Please let me buy this!

169
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,206
They can't replace it.

170
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,911
Both Chappy and Pascal can't replace
a child…

171
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,347
Of course I know that.

172
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,420
I mean, why not?

173
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,389
I enjoy it.

174
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,358
I enjoy being alone with you forever.

175
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,862
Pichan.

176
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,832
Have you washed your hands?

177
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,839
Is it really okay for you to come
now? Your husband…

178
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,909
You have to work during the day, right?

179
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,880
Yeah, a daytime staff member went AWOL.

180
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,348
And tomorrow?

181
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,284
We don't have to meet every day.

182
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,623
Say, a meteorite is going to
crash on Earth.

183
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,059
Yes? What are you talking about?

184
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,897
You have a ticket for the spaceship
that will escape from the Earth,

185
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,598
but I don't.

186
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,499
What will you do?

187
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,904
I'll give you the ticket.

188
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,272
-I don't want that.
-What?

189
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,742
On the other hand, if I have the
ticket and you don't

190
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,245
I will… burn the ticket.

191
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,246
Burn it?

192
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,317
I will choose to stay with you on
the Earth as it dies.

193
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,654
If I choose not to give you the ticket

194
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,056
and board the spaceship…

195
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,858
I will destroy the spaceship.

196
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,462
That is how I express my love for you.

197
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,499
This is not love.

198
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,168
Shuntaro…

199
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,872
That's not love! It's something else!

200
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:22,942
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,878
I'm sorry…

202
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,347
Don't hate me, Shuntaro.

203
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,851
I'm lonely!

204
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,755
I'm lonely…

205
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,463
Mr. Tagawa?

206
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,600
Hey.

207
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,101
What's the matter?

208
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,004
I've come to say hello.

209
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,407
I'm thinking of quitting the
mob and leaving this town.

210
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,943
Really? Why so suddenly?

211
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,614
It's pointless doing this.

212
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,115
Yes?

213
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,219
I've worked very hard in this world
for ten years,

214
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,422
yet what I got is this
little town in the countryside.

215
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,660
But I still wanted to guard my territory,

216
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,529
so I did everything I could over all
these years.

217
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,698
But…

218
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,901
my pride is nothing

219
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,837
to the people from head office.

220
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,707
They won't even realize
if they've crushed me.

221
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,712
Also,

222
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,849
after I met you again,
you made me realize…

223
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,751
Realize what?

224
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,487
How much more capable you are than I am.

225
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,222
That's nonsense.

226
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,762
I'm exhausted, Patrasche.

227
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,963
Patrasche?

228
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,766
A Dog of Flanders!

229
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,934
Oh…

230
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,305
This is my farewell gift.

231
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,373
What? I can take this?

232
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,408
I think it'll suit you.

233
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,312
Thank you! I will treasure it.

234
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,418
Take care, then.

235
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,621
Mr. Tagawa.

236
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,324
I mean, Chancellor, take care!

237
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,502
Oh, welcome back.

238
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,073
Thanks. Welcome back.

239
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,343
Thanks.

240
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,747
<i>Wow, this is lovely.</i>

241
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,917
<i>-Greeting someone when you're home.</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

242
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,653
<i>Especially when you say, "Welcome back".</i>

243
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,688
<i>Doesn't the girl say that?</i>

244
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,890
<i>Well…</i>

245
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,092
<i>She is not staying with me now.</i>

246
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,295
Ask him where she is now.

247
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,366
<i>Are those charm stones?</i>

248
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,068
<i>Is that what they're called?</i>

249
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,871
Is it a gift from your girlfriend?

250
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,374
No, I haven't got a girlfriend.

251
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,309
Oh.

252
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,211
You can have it if you like.

253
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,313
I don't like accessories very much.

254
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,781
How can you give to her?

255
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,650
You said you'd treasure it!

256
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,418
Why did you say you don't like it?

257
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,288
<i>Oh… It's all right. Don't bother.</i>

258
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,956
<i>There is a dragon engraved here.</i>

259
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,225
<i>Yeah…</i>

260
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,961
<i>It's a bit…</i>

261
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,596
<i>Yeah.</i>

262
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,701
I'm glad that you have bad taste.

263
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:37,803
Cheers.

264
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,827
<i>Thank you for your help!</i>

265
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,162
<i>I love you, Keebou!</i>

266
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,542
Good grief.

267
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,544
Eat your tomato, too!

268
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,367
It's him again? Such a pest.

269
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,235
<i>You have a message.</i>

270
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,904
<i>This is Segawa.</i>
<i>Sorry for bothering you again.</i>

271
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,807
<i>I really want to know how Hikari is doing,</i>

272
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,542
<i>so I'll now go to your school.</i>

273
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,846
<i>I just want to see Hikari's cheerful</i>
<i>face somewhere.</i>

274
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,083
-Sorry for that, Chairwoman.
-It's totally okay.

275
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,652
I enjoy my time with Kayo anyway. Right?

276
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,155
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

277
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,090
You guys are still as close as
you used to,

278
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,092
going on a road trip all by yourselves.

279
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,495
We'll look for Tenten along our way.

280
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,896
Don't bother, just leave that idiot.

281
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,933
He's going to be a father!
I can't believe him.

282
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,537
Sorry, we're late. I've borrowed the van.

283
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,571
Thanks…

284
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,707
She is absolutely gorgeous!

285
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,976
Why did she marry Tenten?

286
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,313
You'll understand how charming
Tenten is soon, too, Melos.

287
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,883
Yeah, when Tenten isn't here,
we're not ourselves, too.

288
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,951
If he isn't here people will see
how stupid we are.

289
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,620
Why have you brought snacks?

290
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,854
We're not going to hike.

291
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,322
-We are going hiking!
-Oh?

292
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,625
I didn't notice your bracelet before.

293
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,594
This? Tagawa gave it to me.

294
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:43,996
<i>What?</i>

295
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,531
<i>He said it was a farewell gift.</i>

296
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,733
He said he would leave.

297
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,068
Seriously?

298
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,903
This is fishy.

299
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,471
Has he planted a bug or something?

300
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,873
<i>Impossible.</i>

301
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,209
<i>He's not like that.</i>

302
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,481
<i>I'm so jealous! It's so cool!</i>

303
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,616
<i>Do you want it, Melos?</i>

304
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,118
<i>I don't like accessories.</i>

305
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,686
Don't give it to him!

306
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,188
And how dare you say you don't like it?

307
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,596
Oh, it's from the teacher.

308
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,571
Yeah. She has a high fever.

309
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,006
So much happened lately,
I guess she is tired.

310
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,742
I've taken her to see a doctor today,

311
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,312
so I'm sorry,
but she won't be going to school.

312
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,215
Is Hikari at your house now?

313
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,549
Yes.

314
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,618
Will you let me talk to her?

315
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,195
<i>Keebou…</i>

316
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,699
Hikari!

317
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,034
She said you had a fever. Are you okay?

318
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,570
Yeah, I'm all right.

319
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,174
How are you, Keebou?

320
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,977
<i>I'm good. The guys are good, too.</i>

321
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,012
<i>Hi, Hikari…</i>

322
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,280
<i>Are you eating properly?</i>

323
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,017
I'm all right.

324
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,457
I want to have the stewed beef
you made again!

325
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,892
What? Stewed beef?

326
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,493
I made it.

327
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,863
-Mikki made the stewed…
-I am all right!

328
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,565
Make me stewed beef again, Keebou!

329
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,470
Oh, Hikari, thanks for the origami medal.

330
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,907
Thank you for your lovely message, too.

331
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,745
Keebou.

332
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,550
You've taken it? Thank you.

333
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,485
<i>Taken what?</i>

334
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,388
You've taken it? Thank you.

335
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,593
-Hello. You're happy now?
<i>-Oh…</i>

336
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,729
<i>Can I go to visit her?</i>

337
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,032
That's not…

338
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,869
The doctor said that we can't let
her get too excited.

339
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,103
Keebou!

340
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,705
PHOTO!

341
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,308
Then can you at least send me
a photo of her?

342
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,642
Photo?

343
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>Please.</i>

344
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,080
Okay.

345
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,182
Good grief!

346
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,686
He even asked for a photo.
How much cheekier can he be?

347
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,555
Come on. I'll take a photo, so smile.

348
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,626
Don't make that face!
They'll get suspicious.

349
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,194
Smile!

350
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,532
Don't you think it is strange?

351
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,701
Yeah.

352
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,469
Why did she say "stewed beef"?

353
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,671
Maybe she really liked it?

354
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,773
I told you, it was me who made
her stewed beef.

355
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,408
And one more thing.

356
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,378
"You've taken it? Thank you."

357
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,182
I think she was talking about
the origami medal…

358
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,917
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!
I LOVE YOU, KEEBOU!

359
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,490
Hikari.

360
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,593
-What is that?
-It's whistle candy.

361
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,494
Whistle candy?

362
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,265
-You don't know that?
-It's called the generation gap.

363
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,201
Guys.

364
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,604
I think she lied about something
that Keebou would know was a lie.

365
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,140
I mean the stewed beef.

366
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,876
What do you mean, and why?

367
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,945
To let you know that she is lying.

368
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,080
Did she talk about the stewed beef

369
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,750
after she said she was all right?

370
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,351
So in other words…

371
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,121
I think she meant that
she was not all right.

372
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,956
Oh!

373
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,624
What's the matter, Melos?

374
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,694
Is it possible that…
"You've taken it? Thank you"…

375
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,563
If you take away "thank you"…

376
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,132
Look!

377
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,133
SAVE

378
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,515
Ms. Sawako Fujishiro is on leave today.

379
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,150
I see.

380
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,652
She said that she was going
to the hospital.

381
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,623
Do you know where
Ms. Sawako Fujishiro lives?

382
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,626
I can't tell you.

383
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,127
Thought so.

384
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,398
But we've confirmed that the teacher
is real.

385
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,967
Yes, I've checked that, too.

386
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,937
It's impossible that a teacher would
hang out with gangsters.

387
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,339
We've overthought it.

388
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,340
She didn't call for help.

389
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,275
We were as smart as Ikkyu, though.

390
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,476
Right, Melos?

391
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,379
Oh.

392
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,348
It's Hikari.

393
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,415
-What?
-Look!

394
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,450
HAPPY! JOYFUL! SMILE!

395
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,484
Oh, it is her.

396
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,190
SMILE WITH MS. SAWAKO

397
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,826
<i>We took it when we went hiking last year.</i>

398
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,134
Mikki?

399
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,304
Hey…

400
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,472
I'm sorry, Keebou!

401
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,806
What's the matter, Mikki?

402
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,707
She deceived me.

403
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,209
I was deceived.

404
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,144
That woman…

405
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,947
is not a teacher.

406
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,682
What?

407
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,033
Why don't you kill her?

408
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,538
No one ordered me to.

409
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,778
Will you kill her
if someone orders you to?

410
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,347
I will.

411
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,051
You'll kill me, too?

412
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:44,723
You don't…

413
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,459
hate killing?

414
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,761
Why?

415
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,864
Killing people is wrong!

416
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:57,936
Why?

417
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,408
Why?

418
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:05,877
Why?

419
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,782
Hey!

420
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,752
Don't get so close, you two!

421
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,823
You! Don't seduce my son!

422
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,659
Kids nowadays are horrible.

423
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,994
If you have time to bat your
eyelashes at him,

424
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,663
remember where it is now!

425
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:25,630
I don't have much time!

426
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,603
It's those guys again?
They're such a nuisance!

427
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,572
Oh!

428
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,841
Hello.

429
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:36,775
Sir?

430
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,744
Yes, I have got her.

431
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,548
No, her memory is still…

432
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,750
Yes?

433
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,752
The mountain?

434
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,653
Sure.

435
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,324
I've received an order. We're going out.

436
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,626
Where to?

437
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,162
To the place where you were. Mount Nakane.

438
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:58,797
What?

439
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,398
I told you I didn't have time.

440
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,300
Maybe you'll remember something
if you go there.

441
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,169
Does he have something else…

442
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,471
It's those guys.

443
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,372
Let's go.

444
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,247
No, she isn't answering the phone.

445
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,382
Darn!

446
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,219
I want to at least tell Hikari that
we're aware of her message.

447
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,989
I think it's important.

448
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,291
So that she won't be downhearted.

449
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,861
The woman doesn't know that
we have realized that,

450
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,330
so she might answer the phone next time.

451
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,734
Mikki.

452
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,638
The fake teacher was
a middle-aged woman, right?

453
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,473
Get in.

454
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,415
Oh, my!

455
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,620
Hello?

456
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,090
-You're joking! She really answered it!
-This is ridiculous!

457
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,525
You're incredible, Choco.

458
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,828
This really is the last time.

459
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,331
Please understand that.

460
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,233
This is for Hikari's own good.

461
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,634
<i>Okay.</i>

462
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,269
<i>I understand that.</i>

463
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,273
Hello.

464
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,442
Keebou?

465
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,311
<i>Hikari.</i>

466
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,112
<i>We got it.</i>

467
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,783
<i>We understand it very well.</i>

468
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,186
<i>We got what you said.</i>

469
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:31,856
<i>Hikari.</i>

470
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,527
<i>We will all come to see you.</i>

471
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,564
<i>So before we do so,</i>
<i>no matter how tough it is,</i>

472
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,034
<i>don't be defeated, Hikari.</i>

473
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,671
You remember it, right?

474
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,475
As long as you don't admit defeat,

475
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,279
you're just on your way to
claim your victory.

476
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,216
Keebou!

477
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,517
<i>Hikari…</i>

478
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,920
Don't give up until you win.

479
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,227
Mount Nakane!

480
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,163
-What?
<i>-Mount Nakane…</i>

481
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,699
-Drive the car here!
-All right!

482
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,473
-Mount Nakane…
-Stupid brat!

483
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,944
Now I will do anything to
make you remember!

484
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,081
Mikki, drive safely, okay?

485
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,950
It's a total loss if we're caught
speeding!

486
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,488
Mikki, be careful!

487
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,050
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

488
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,754
This is her car. It has to be.

489
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,256
Hikari!

490
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,394
It's here.

491
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,774
MT. NAKANE HIKING ROUTE

492
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,675
Which way should we go?

493
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,944
-Keebou!
-Yes?

494
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,379
Look.

495
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,857
It's a miracle that you fell down
from here

496
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,092
and are still unharmed!

497
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,194
I fell down from here?

498
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,963
But there won't be a second miracle.

499
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,466
You will die right away
if you fall this time!

500
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,069
Think! Try to remember!

501
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,538
Where is it?

502
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,439
No!

503
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,242
You hid it somewhere in
this mountain, didn't you?

504
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,545
I don't know! I don't!

505
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,380
Remember it! Now!

506
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,816
I don't know!

507
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,224
Hikari!

508
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,928
You're lying about having amnesia,
aren't you?

509
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,063
Tell me!

510
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,365
Tell me everything you remember!

511
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,466
Please don't do this!

512
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,636
I know you're the last person who had it.

513
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,140
Help me! Keebou!

514
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,175
Keebou!

515
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,445
Hikari!

516
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,850
-Keebou…
-Hikari!

517
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,918
Shut up!

518
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,686
Don't come here!

519
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,890
If you get any closer,
I'll throw this brat down.

520
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,726
Give us back Hikari, please!

521
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,861
Of course I won't give her to you, idiot.

522
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,762
No, you will.

523
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,632
How dare you lie to me, old hag?

524
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,766
Kill him!

525
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,436
No!

526
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,438
Don't kill Mikki!

527
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,007
Don't kill anyone!

528
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,576
Kill him now!

529
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,411
This is an order!

530
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,312
No!

531
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,681
You're actually very kind, aren't you?

532
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,349
You gave me whistle candies!

533
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,252
You didn't want to kill the
policeman, right?

534
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:25,790
It was you…

535
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,892
You killed Mr. Akagi!

536
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,595
-Jerk!
-No! He is dangerous!

537
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,099
-Ponjara!
-Are you all right?

538
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,369
It's useless. He is a professional.

539
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,305
What? Professional?

540
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,707
What else? He's a professional killer.

541
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,709
An assassin!

542
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,315
Kill them now! This is an order!

543
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,219
No!

544
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,921
Don't kill them!

545
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,558
Do it. Do you want to disobey
mummy's order?

546
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,928
Don't obey this! This is wrong!

547
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,931
-Killing people is wrong!
-Shut up!

548
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,501
You have to repay him.

549
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,137
Who is the reason why the two of us
can live so long?

550
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:15,874
The Hierarch.

551
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,409
Yes. Good boy.

552
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,380
Don't do this!

553
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,281
Do it now!

554
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,216
If you want to kill, kill us yourself!

555
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,786
I don't know why you have to
repay that person,

556
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,857
but no mother would make her own son
a killer!

557
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,259
You don't

558
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,227
deserve to be his mother!

559
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,263
Shut up!

560
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,232
You know nothing about us.

561
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,634
Don't you patronize me!

562
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,036
My son…

563
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,306
is different from normal children.

564
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,809
Everybody ran as soon as they knew this.

565
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,778
My husband and my parents abandoned us.

566
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,446
But only the Hierarch…

567
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,015
Hierarch?

568
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,250
Only he

569
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,153
extended a helping hand to me
when I was at a loss what to do.

570
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,556
He was the only one in this world
to do this.

571
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,426
All of you are irresponsible

572
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,895
and all you do is bring your parents
trouble. You won't understand!

573
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,264
The Hierarch…

574
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,967
found him a kindergarten, a hospital,

575
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,337
and more importantly, he gave him
a way to live!

576
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,240
So that he can live even when
I'm not with him.

577
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,141
And that's…

578
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,209
You said that way was
to work as an assassin?

579
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,879
Being an assassin is better than
dying a dog's death!

580
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,913
Of course it isn't!

581
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,250
It's okay to kill because
you have to live?

582
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,686
-That's not…
-Then what should we do?

583
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,355
We have to do this.

584
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,691
We had to do this.

585
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,759
Or…

586
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,395
are you saying that you guys will help us?

587
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,832
Will you take care of my son
for the rest of his life? Tell me.

588
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,269
Will you give us enough money
for him to live the rest of his life?

589
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,172
My son's life…

590
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,174
is more important than other people's.

591
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,776
This is the life that I treasure!

592
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,678
I don't care about the other ones!

593
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,548
Now,

594
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,316
kill them.

595
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,217
-This is an order.
-No!

596
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,519
Don't kill them!

597
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,125
I'll kill him.

598
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,329
I will kill him.

599
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,934
Even if we will die on
each other's swords,

600
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,704
I will kill your son so that Hikari
and the guys will live.

601
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,805
Do you still think…

602
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,674
that this is what you have to do?

603
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,011
You are right.

604
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,413
The life you treasure

605
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,715
is more important than other people's.

606
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,317
But…

607
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,586
Other people's lives…

608
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,689
are also important to someone else.

609
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,126
Isn't this sad?

610
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,496
If someone you treasure dies,

611
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,565
the sadness is unbearable.

612
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,135
Why did you make your son

613
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,938
someone who gives people such sadness?

614
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,579
It's okay.

615
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,315
He doesn't understand this.

616
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,186
He doesn't have a heart that
can feel emotions like that!

617
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,487
You're wrong!

618
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,555
He was very kind.

619
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,892
He taught me how to blow
the whistle candy!

620
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,461
He has killed a lot of people!

621
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,929
Without even flinching.

622
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,133
Is someone with a heart even
capable of that?

623
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,171
He only wanted to make you happy.

624
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,108
He only…

625
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,044
wanted to make his mother happy.

626
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,948
Because he loves his mom.

627
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,550
Loves…

628
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,286
He loves me?

629
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,991
It's impossible.

630
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,462
-His mother is so awful…
-No matter how you are as a mom,

631
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,531
children just love their mother.

632
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,167
He just wants to make you happy.

633
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,970
So desperately…

634
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,640
that even if he has to betray his friends

635
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,244
he would do anything to make
his mother happy!

636
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,476
-Keebou!
-Hikari…

637
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,979
They must have suffered a lot.

638
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,186
Okay. Thanks for your work.

639
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,795
Give me the kid.

640
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,500
Hey.

641
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,469
You are the puppet in the rumors?

642
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,806
Although you are as strong as a demon

643
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,144
you can't do anything if
no one orders you.

644
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,602
What is going on?

645
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,805
Aren't they allies?

646
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:22,974
I don't know!

647
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,742
Keebou, take Hikari with you and run!

648
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,581
Come here.

649
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,719
Keebou!

650
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,620
Hikari!

651
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,390
-Go to hell!
-Don't!

652
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:07,818
Mommy?

653
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,922
Mommy…

654
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,708
I was told to kill anyone on that
side as soon as I saw them.

655
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,143
On that side?

656
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:35,680
Don't come here!

657
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,581
No…

658
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,127
Don't come here!

659
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,900
Help!

660
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,736
Don't kill me!

661
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:09,680
I won't kill.

662
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,619
I know.

663
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,890
Why I shouldn't kill…

664
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,264
Because it is sad.

665
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,435
If Mommy dies…

666
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,240
If she is not with me…

667
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:41,746
I feel sad.

668
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,936
We will take care of the rest.

669
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,639
But can we at least see
whether he is alive or not?

670
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,908
The sound of a gunshot reached even here.

671
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,243
The police will come soon.

672
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,017
Go! You'll cause us trouble.

673
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,209
What was that?

674
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:19,743
A bird?

675
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,783
Hikari.

676
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,720
He must still be alive.

677
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,134
Mamoru…

678
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,008
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

679
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,348
Okay…

680
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,685
Noriaki…

681
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,988
Where have you been?

682
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,456
You…

683
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,893
I have been thinking.

684
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,165
I'll embrace it. I don't care
whose children they are,

685
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,402
your children are mine… Ow!

686
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,170
They are your children!

687
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,339
But I…

688
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,477
I can't believe this.

689
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,879
How can someone as good as you…

690
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:31,916
fall in love

691
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,351
-with an idiot like me?
-Believe it!

692
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,390
I love you, Noriaki! I really do!

693
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,993
I love your everything,
even how stupid you are!

694
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,366
Momoyo!

695
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,143
Well, I…

696
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,245
I'm sorry!

697
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,680
-Tenten.
-Yes?

698
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,481
-Wash it!
-Oh…

699
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,117
I'm happy to!

700
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,038
NEW MESSAGE

701
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,841
Oh, it's from Kiichi.

702
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,946
FROM KIICHI. THANK YOU, MOM.

703
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,983
What a surprise.

704
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,065
Sir…

705
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,968
Don't stress yourself.

706
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,973
Sir…

707
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,110
I'm very sorry.

708
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,812
We cannot…

709
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,547
Don't worry about it.

710
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,750
Thanks for everything you've done.

711
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,351
Have a good rest.

712
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,588
I have really been horrible

713
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,257
to you and your son.

714
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,459
Sir…

715
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,295
Thank you.

716
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,831
Thank you.

717
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,168
But…

718
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:33,971
Where is Mamoru?

719
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,907
Where is my son?

720
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,310
Oh, don't worry.

721
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,845
You will see him soon.

722
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,057
Thank you.

723
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,293
Sir…

724
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,531
Thank you…

725
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,567
very…

726
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:09,206
You will meet Mamoru very soon.

727
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,109
In heaven.

728
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,997
Lives are on the line, Keebou.

729
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,232
We can't win.

730
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,434
<i>Leave now if you won't take part.</i>

731
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,738
<i>Are you in</i>
<i>some trouble about that incident?</i>

732
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,740
It's weird that we still can't find her.

733
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,842
<i>Sorry for dragging you into this.</i>

734
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,243
Thanks for everything.
