1
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,591
What's wrong?

2
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:26,659
Did you have a nightmare?

3
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:32,899
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,135
Why?

5
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,137
For waking you up.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,640
No need to apologize for that.
I was awake anyway.

7
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,991
Have I told you why we gave
Pichan the nickname Pichan?

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,160
No, you haven't.

9
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,596
He's always ready to pick a fight,
but in a way he's a coward.

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,466
He always gets anxious
when we have a big fight

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,034
and gets an upset stomach.

12
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,971
So we call him Pichan,
because his stomach goes "pi…"

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,776
Although he shuts himself
in the toilet before a fight

14
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,380
his upset stomach is cured when the
fight starts. Every single time.

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,082
Is that so?

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,585
I guess…

17
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,956
The scariest part of a fight
is the time before it starts.

18
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:31,958
Before it starts?

19
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,761
You don't know who your opponent is

20
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,030
or how strong they are,

21
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,967
but you can only wait,
and everything is unknown.

22
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,735
This is the scariest part.

23
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,441
Let's try to take the initiative.

24
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,344
What? Initiative?

25
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,846
I'm not saying that we'll go punch them.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,316
I mean, we know nothing.

27
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,252
Although we want to look for something,

28
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,988
we don't even know what it is.

29
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,591
Yeah.

30
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,494
Thank you!

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,795
Thank you…

32
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,696
Thank you!

33
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,297
Thank you…

34
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,800
Thank you for being born into this world.

35
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,669
Thank you for being born into this world…

36
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>How do you feel?</i>

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,119
After joining the whole purification
ceremony for the first time.

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,424
<i>My body…</i>

39
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,093
was trembling.

40
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,529
Marvelous!

41
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,634
Your soul was cleansed
by the purification ceremony,

42
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,803
and it was quivering with delight.

43
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,580
MIKI TIRES

44
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,317
-I'm sorry, Mikki.
-It's all right.

45
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,853
There is nothing to apologize for.
It's our regular day off.

46
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,888
Is Kayo still at Tenten's place?

47
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,224
Yeah, he picked her up when he came
to deliver our clothes.

48
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,895
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,765
Hello, Segawa speaking.

50
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:20,967
Thanks for calling me.

51
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,903
Oh, I'm terribly sorry…

52
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,906
No, I'm not available today…

53
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,681
It's suspicious that we couldn't
find anything at all.

54
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,549
Why?

55
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,084
I mean…

56
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,887
We should at least find out
where her parents work,

57
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,322
or her friends' contact details.

58
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,557
There has to be something
if this is where she lives.

59
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,692
Well, you're right.

60
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,860
Did Tagawa take them away?

61
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,663
Or was there for some reason
never anything?

62
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,606
Do I have a mother?

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,612
I can't even find a photo of her.

64
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,549
And nothing in this house
belongs to my mother.

65
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,253
Keebou.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,691
This is strange.

67
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,995
I don't remember them…

68
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,934
and I can't recall what they're like…

69
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,041
but I miss them.

70
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,677
Dad…

71
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,015
and Mom too.

72
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,254
Don't worry.

73
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:23,956
We'll find them soon.

74
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,772
Is it the one Kayo was listening to
the other day?

75
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,274
This looks quite old,

76
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,543
so I think it might be your mom's.

77
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,894
June 10, 2004?

78
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,529
It was ten years ago.

79
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,167
Maybe it's your birthday.

80
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,068
Birthday?

81
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,037
Even if it isn't,

82
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,939
it still has to be an important date.

83
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,514
It's making a sound.

84
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,918
It's shallow.

85
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,653
-What?
-Look.

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,389
Look, the bottom of the box
seems to be deeper than this.

87
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,090
Yes, indeed.

88
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,004
A key?

89
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,775
What is it for?

90
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,445
This looks like a key
to an apartment door.

91
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,248
What is this for?

92
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,751
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

93
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,955
There you go.

94
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,958
-They're the guys'.
-Oh, thanks.

95
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,761
We have to do it for free for the guys.

96
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,696
There was a stain
that didn't come off easily.

97
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,268
I think it was blood.

98
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,669
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

99
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,104
A bloodstain.

100
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,906
I see.

101
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,277
Noriaki, you came back
with an injury the other day…

102
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,411
I told you,

103
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,380
we got into a fight with some drunks.

104
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,049
But you got another fresh wound
very soon after that.

105
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,418
It was obvious.

106
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,322
Oh?

107
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:37,857
Where is Kayo?

108
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,159
Oh, no!

109
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,463
A full-time employee in the main office?

110
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,965
The Security Measures Department,

111
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,768
that means they want you
to join the department

112
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,503
that takes measures
to prevent shoplifting.

113
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,473
Good Lord, I don't get
our company's taste.

114
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,541
Why did they choose me?

115
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,810
It seems that the number of
shoplifting incidents in our branch

116
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,946
-is much smaller than the others.
-What?

117
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,614
You have to do an exam as a formality,

118
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,150
but they want you to go to Tokyo
right after you do that.

119
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,053
-Go and get everything sorted.
-Okay.

120
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,090
I guess he'd have been delighted, too.

121
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,527
The detective who referred you here.

122
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,596
Manager…

123
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:18,631
Thank you!

124
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,639
Mr. Tokui, congratulations!

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,074
Thank you!

126
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,644
I'm so jealous.
I'd like to go to Tokyo too!

127
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,079
What?

128
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:34,881
What?

129
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,782
Never mind.

130
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,820
Saya.

131
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,457
You didn't buy anything today.

132
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,060
I don't have to buy anything
when I'm with you.

133
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,029
Is that so?

134
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,732
Pichan.

135
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,271
Why do you let me buy whatever I want?

136
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,110
Is it because…

137
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,813
you think that I'm lonely
and you feel bad for me?

138
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,224
Toru.

139
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,993
You…

140
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,464
You're often injured
when you come home late.

141
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,800
Yes?

142
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,069
Are you…?

143
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,906
Did someone bully you?

144
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,043
What? No!

145
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,844
If you have been bullied,

146
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,913
just remember that I will protect you.

147
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,482
Because I am your mother.

148
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,385
I will protect you.

149
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
Remember to keep an eye on her.

150
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,326
I will. I'm sorry.

151
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,894
See you.

152
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,731
-I'm sorry, Mikki.
-I'm very sorry.

153
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,166
She went outside
when I wasn't paying attention.

154
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,367
Don't feel guilty.

155
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,969
I should be the one to say sorry.

156
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:03,869
It's okay.

157
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,605
Let's go home.

158
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,645
Sorry, Keebou,
for not completing our search.

159
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,046
It's okay.

160
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,848
Let's go to Choco's karaoke bar tonight.

161
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,583
Oh, thanks.

162
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,286
I'll call Ponjara and the other two guys.

163
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,722
Sorry for causing you so much trouble.

164
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,559
See you later, Tenten.
Thank you, Chairwoman.

165
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,660
Take care.

166
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,561
Let's go.

167
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,837
Look at this, Keebou.

168
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,509
An armband?

169
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,544
Is it a newspaper company?

170
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,626
ARMBAND, NEWSPAPER, PHOTOS

171
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,037
Nichidoku Shimbun?

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,975
NICHIDOKU SHIMBUN, GOTO

173
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,624
KARAOKE BOX URARA

174
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,225
-A news reporter?
-Yeah.

175
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,095
Hikari's dad seems to be a reporter
who works for Nichidoku Shimbun.

176
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,163
Seriously?

177
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,731
-Yeah. Look.
-Wow.

178
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,232
Look at the armband.

179
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,036
Nichidoku Shimbun? Wow.

180
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,239
The main office building
is in Shinagawa, Tokyo.

181
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,411
Like… We'll go and have a look?

182
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,215
We've finally found a clue!

183
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,116
When are you going?

184
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,752
As soon as possible. Tomorrow.

185
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,622
I hope someone will come with us.

186
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,391
I mean, if something happens to me,

187
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,826
it will be dangerous for Hikari
to be on her own.

188
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,500
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

189
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,571
I think we'd better leave this
to the police.

190
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,975
Frankly,

191
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,444
I think so, too.

192
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,445
But Ponjara…

193
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,953
-Same here.
-You still say that?

194
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,354
You all know…

195
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,490
that even the police can't be trusted.

196
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,626
Too many people have died for it.

197
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,865
Mr. Akagi,

198
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,334
the yakuza guy who liked whistle candies…

199
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,635
Even the fake teacher.

200
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,804
Though her life was saved,

201
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,372
she was still shot.

202
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,975
This is not normal.

203
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,344
We've been playing by ear when we do this,

204
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,113
but it's too risky
to get further involved.

205
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,616
We really will be killed.

206
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,151
I agree.

207
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,853
It's not a problem we can solve

208
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,655
just by following the nature of
the course or our fighting spirit.

209
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,925
But I thought you wanted to see what
you got involved in through to its end.

210
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,826
We're saying

211
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,663
that we have to risk our lives,
Keebou. Do you get it?

212
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,898
We won't be killed!

213
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,801
I guess…

214
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,670
But we have been close to
being killed many times.

215
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,905
But we were not killed.

216
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,506
It's the same this time.

217
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,876
If they want to kill us,
they can do it any time.

218
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:31,977
You are right, Keebou.

219
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,414
They can kill us any time they want.

220
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:37,883
The gangsters, too,

221
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,287
should want to avoid taking risks
if possible.

222
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,722
I don't think

223
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,625
they would lightly kill
honest people nowadays.

224
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,526
But…

225
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,263
You can't be sure that
they will always stay that way.

226
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,335
No matter how you look at it,

227
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,505
we can't possibly win this battle.

228
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,743
But guys, you still went there
at that time.

229
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,181
You still went to a fight where there
were 100 people versus you five.

230
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,783
It was a fight between kids.

231
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,185
-They didn't take our lives.
-Then what about Hikari?

232
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,821
-She is on her own!
-We'll take her to the police…

233
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,656
I'm saying that we can't trust the police!

234
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,492
But that's not a reason
for us to get further involved!

235
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,469
I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.

236
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,338
It's okay.

237
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,607
But…

238
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,010
We still can't risk our lives.

239
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,912
Just for someone's child.

240
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,217
There is someone else
who I want to risk my life for.

241
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,157
Okay.

242
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,461
I can do it.

243
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,266
I can go to Tokyo with you.

244
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,901
There is no one for me.

245
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,804
There is nobody who I want
to risk my life for, like you.

246
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,311
Frankly, your life isn't that important.

247
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,245
Choco!

248
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,414
Text me the time and stuff.

249
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,218
Thanks, Choco.

250
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,160
Sorry for getting you guys involved.

251
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,729
Thanks for everything.

252
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,566
KADOMATSU INDUSTRIES

253
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,801
Yes.

254
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,803
We have found Mr. Yanagihara's body.

255
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,506
But the guy on that side…

256
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,841
seemed to have been gotten rid of
before us.

257
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,080
Okay, we will.

258
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,853
The time has finally come.

259
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,256
Did the main branch summon us?

260
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,858
If you want to drop out, do it now.

261
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,961
You could get shot if it doesn't go well.

262
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,530
You don't have to lose your life
for nothing.

263
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,034
Boss.

264
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,838
-Thanks for everything…
-Seriously?

265
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,876
We were just kidding, boss.

266
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,346
Idiots…

267
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,649
Boss, we have talked about this,

268
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,286
but shall we have one as well?

269
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,187
What do you mean?

270
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,356
You know, like, "Who Are You?"

271
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,559
-Like, "Who are you?"
-We've already talked about it.

272
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,172
TOMORROW 7 A.M. AT THE SOUTH GATE. THANKS!

273
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,451
CALLER: SHIHO

274
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:01,887
What?

275
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:03,956
<i>Shuntaro,</i>

276
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,458
<i>thank you for everything.</i>

277
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,194
<i>I was happy.</i>

278
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,730
What? What are you saying?

279
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,600
<i>I am going to die soon.</i>

280
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,068
What?

281
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,839
<i>But I have to hear your voice</i>
<i>before I die.</i>

282
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,243
Seriously, I hate it when you do this.

283
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,247
<i>You said that it wasn't love…</i>

284
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,084
<i>But believe me, Shuntaro…</i>

285
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,953
<i>I do love you.</i>

286
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,123
<i>And I love only you.</i>

287
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,928
Where are you now?

288
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,603
<i>The phone you have dialed</i>

289
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,039
<i>has been switched off,</i>
<i>and cannot be reached.</i>

290
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,407
Darn woman!

291
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,613
Gosh! Seriously, will you give me a break?

292
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,620
Shiho.

293
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,155
Shiho?

294
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,959
Shiho…

295
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,995
Hey! Shiho, hang in there!

296
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,465
Oh, Choco.

297
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,567
-What's the matter…?
<i>-The owner cannot answer the phone…</i>

298
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,769
CHOCO

299
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,609
Let's go.

300
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,159
Don't worry, I'm here with you.

301
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,197
Mr. Goto's daughter?

302
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,565
Yes.

303
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,000
What?

304
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,935
Why are you here?

305
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,804
Aren't you with your father?

306
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,906
With her father?

307
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,641
He was sent to work overseas
for a long time.

308
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,109
-Oh, Miya.
-Yes?

309
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,011
Mr. Goto is in Italy now, right?

310
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,412
Yes.

311
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,648
What? Is that true?

312
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,684
Of course, he reports his duties
by e-mail every day.

313
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,685
Does he?

314
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,387
I'm glad for you.

315
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,056
Who is this girl?

316
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,459
She says that she is Mr. Goto's daughter.

317
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,360
Oh.

318
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,462
But that's strange.

319
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,998
-Strange?
-Yeah.

320
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,368
I mean, Mr. Goto's daughter
is in Italy with him.

321
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,004
He attached a photo of her
in the e-mail yesterday.

322
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,905
What?

323
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,042
Here it is.

324
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,610
Look.

325
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,486
Well, she does look like this girl.

326
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,490
Hey, are you a reporter from somewhere?

327
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,425
No, I…

328
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,727
You even bring a child with you
to infiltrate our company…

329
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,130
-Which company do you work for?
-No, I…

330
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,965
Anyway, get out of here now!

331
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,634
-Just go…
-Please let me explain.

332
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,535
Listen…

333
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,172
Hikari.

334
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,975
Look, I'm Matsui.

335
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:11,677
I'm Uncle Keita.

336
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,048
What a relief! You're unharmed.

337
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,552
I have always felt
that something was wrong.

338
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,288
When I read the e-mails
sent by Mr. Goto from Italy,

339
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,426
I just felt that they were not
written by him.

340
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,494
Also,

341
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,698
in the photos of Hikari
that Mr. Goto sends from Italy,

342
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,134
none of them show Hikari's face properly.

343
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,903
So…

344
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,939
I thought perhaps this wasn't Hikari.

345
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,610
But who did this? And why did they do it?

346
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:50,949
It's possible that…

347
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,487
he got into some kind of trouble
because of that case.

348
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,125
But Mr. Goto never told anybody
in the company

349
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,027
about his investigation on the case.

350
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,098
He suspected that someone in the
company may be involved as well,

351
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,401
so I can't be careless
and say something I shouldn't.

352
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,869
That's why I put on an act just now.

353
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,171
What case was that?

354
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,042
It's about…

355
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,645
his wife's death.

356
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,961
This is my home.

357
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,800
<i>His apartment is around the corner.</i>

358
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,536
I have been there many times.

359
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,924
Could this be your mom?

360
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,964
She looks kind.

361
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,126
A CAR CAUGHT FIRE
DEAD BODY FOUND INSIDE

362
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,627
THE REMAINS OF A FEMALE DRIVER
WERE DISCOVERED IN THE BURNING CAR

363
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,995
DRIVER FOUND DEAD IN A CAR FIRE

364
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,570
BUMPED INTO A LAMPPOST.
WOMAN BURNT TO DEATH IN HER CAR

365
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,505
<i>Mr. Goto…</i>

366
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,107
suspected that his wife's death
wasn't an accident.

367
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:33,712
Hikari?

368
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,218
You said she has lost her memory,

369
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,187
even the fact that her mom passed away?

370
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,923
Yes.

371
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:47,893
I see.

372
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hikari.

373
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,768
Tell me.

374
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,438
Tell me, please.

375
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,442
All the details.

376
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,344
Mr. Goto…

377
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,048
has always suspected that

378
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,820
the accident was planned,
in other words, it was murder.

379
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,622
And behind this…

380
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,894
was a cult called the Glorious Ark.

381
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,231
The Glorious Ark…

382
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,633
MITSUTERU SAKAKI

383
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,502
THE GLORIOUS ARK RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION,
MITSUTERU SAKAKI

384
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,039
WHAT IS THE GLORIOUS ARK?

385
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,607
PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THE GLORIOUS ARK

386
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,242
SUSPICION OF LAND TRANSACTION

387
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,979
THE GLORIOUS ARK IS A FRAUD RING?

388
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,825
Hello.

389
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,861
The key you showed me just now…

390
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,496
I think…

391
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,700
it could be the key
to Mr. Goto's desk drawer.

392
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,735
I didn't realize until now

393
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,238
that desks at the Culture Department
are different from ours.

394
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,774
Okay. I'll bring it there at once.

395
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,343
<i>See you in 20 minutes then.</i>

396
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:12,911
<i>I'll wait at the entrance.</i>

397
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,115
If we know what this key is for,

398
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,951
there must be something we will find
in what is locked up.

399
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,356
We will surely find it.

400
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,228
He's late.

401
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,778
Call an ambulance! Now!

402
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,214
Are you okay? Any idea who he is?

403
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,016
Are you all right?

404
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,984
Someone, call an ambulance!

405
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,019
Call an ambulance now!

406
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,621
An ambulance! Now!

407
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,256
Hikari, we have to go.

408
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,925
What the heck?

409
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,106
What the heck is going on?

410
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,413
Hikari, it's okay.

411
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,881
Don't worry.

412
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,417
Keebou…

413
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,355
MIKKI

414
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,633
Please come in.

415
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,269
Thanks…

416
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,909
The loot is probably not here.

417
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,811
We turned the place inside out
looking for it.

418
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,213
Well,

419
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,116
just remember where the apartment is.

420
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,919
Excuse me, but what is the "loot"?

421
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,355
Seriously?

422
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,359
Nobody has told you
what we are looking for?

423
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,662
No…

424
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,664
We were only told to bring them the kid.

425
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,703
They all looked down on you,

426
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,971
because you're a rustic.

427
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,309
It is a cellphone.

428
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,446
The kid's dad's cellphone.

429
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,149
What is on the cellphone?

430
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,519
I can't tell you that much,
though, just that…

431
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,722
it has stored photos with things
that shouldn't be in them.

432
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,057
Anyway,

433
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,026
why didn't you kill them right away?

434
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,896
The guys who were clinging to the kid.

435
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,134
Well, I just think that it isn't necessary
if we've got the kid.

436
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,270
But you haven't got the kid!

437
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,205
And that's because those guys
are with her!

438
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,911
Go and kill them now.

439
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:38,016
I heard that other side has long
been given the green light.

440
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,884
Kill them all.

441
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,353
Before you become a disgrace.

442
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,550
What…?

443
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,620
What is this?

444
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,098
Keebou?

445
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,680
Let's get out of here
when it gets brighter.

446
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,383
-But where are we going?
-Wherever.

447
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,153
It's dangerous to stay here.

448
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,831
CHOCO

449
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,333
I'm really sorry. I'm very sorry.

450
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,704
It's okay. So is she okay?

451
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,506
<i>She is okay.</i>

452
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:13,211
In the end she didn't
take enough to kill her.

453
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,381
Yeah, she did it on purpose,
it was a sham suicide.

454
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,450
I've had enough.

455
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,019
<i>How is it going there?</i>

456
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,892
The apartment where Hikari used to live
was right next to the newspaper company.

457
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,030
<i>You've gotten quite a long way.</i>

458
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,399
<i>I'll go there first thing</i>
<i>in the morning tomorrow, then.</i>

459
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,466
No!

460
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,367
Why?

461
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,603
<i>You don't have to come.</i>

462
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,706
<i>-Don't come here, Choco.</i>
-Why?

463
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:43,975
You guys don't have to come.

464
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,011
I can manage this on my own.

465
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,915
-Bye.
<i>-Keebou!</i>

466
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,431
Keebou,

467
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,499
I'll go to the police.

468
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,068
What?

469
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,972
-I'll go to the police, then you…
-Don't say that now.

470
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,507
-I'm sorry, but…
-If you're going now…

471
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,479
Then why didn't you
go to the police at first?

472
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,551
You don't like the police, that's why I…

473
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,753
The guys and me…

474
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,756
We all did everything for you.

475
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,459
Isn't it too late to say that?

476
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,663
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,502
I'm sorry, it was uncalled for.

478
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,206
I should be the one to say sorry.

479
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,542
But Hikari,

480
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:53,778
don't be defeated.

481
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,415
I won't be defeated either.

482
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,651
So…

483
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,954
please don't say that.

484
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,370
Hikari…

485
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:23,808
In the bathroom?

486
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,163
MIKKI, THANKS FOR HANGING OUT WITH ME.

487
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,798
TENTEN, THANKS FOR WATCHING OVER ME.

488
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,399
CHOCO, THANKS FOR BEING SO NICE TO ME.

489
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,034
PICHAN, THANKS FOR YOUR SMILE.

490
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,636
PONJARA, THANKS FOR CHEERING ME UP.

491
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,504
MELOS, THANKS FOR BRINGING ME TO THE GUYS.

492
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:01,980
Hikari!

493
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:03,848
Mr. Segawa?

494
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,654
Oh? Miss Mifumi? Why…?

495
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,256
I came to attend my hospital's
seminar in the neighborhood.

496
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,658
What are you here for?

497
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,660
Oh, no!

498
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,328
Over there…

499
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,331
-Oh, no!
-What is she doing?

500
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,766
This is horrible!

501
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,134
We need to do something!

502
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,602
She's going to jump off…

503
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,738
That's… Hikari?

504
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,406
Hikari!

505
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:51,462
Hikari!

506
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,566
What are you doing, Hikari? Come here.

507
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,501
Stop there!

508
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,404
It's fine.

509
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,373
-It's fine now.
-What is fine?

510
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:04,609
This is not fine at all!

511
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,712
Hikari.

512
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,581
Don't give up until you win.

513
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,219
What is "win"?

514
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,790
I work hard, so I won't be defeated.

515
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,626
Then what?

516
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,028
Hikari…

517
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,496
Nothing.

518
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,866
I have nothing!

519
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,670
My mom is dead.

520
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,641
Maybe even my dad, too…

521
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,975
You don't "have nothing".

522
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,078
You've got me!

523
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,915
-I think of you as my family…
-It's fine, Keebou.

524
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,683
It's not fine!

525
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,087
Don't be ridiculous.

526
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,122
If you're prepared to die,

527
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,591
then you can do anything
with the same desperation!

528
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,359
That's not true.

529
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,966
You're killing yourself because you
want to do nothing.

530
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,268
You don't want to know anything,

531
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,370
see anything,

532
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,940
or hear anything.

533
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,109
That's why you're killing yourself.

534
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,584
Lots of people died…

535
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,386
because of me.

536
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,889
-It's not your fault.
-It is my fault!

537
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,592
It's obvious, don't treat me
like an idiot.

538
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,962
If you stay with me

539
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,198
you will die, too.

540
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,605
I am sorry, Keebou…

541
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,473
-Hikari…
-I'm sorry…

542
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,344
that I was defeated.

543
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,412
-Wait…
-I'm sorry…

544
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,149
that I couldn't win.

545
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,217
Hikari!

546
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,455
You didn't win or lose, Hikari!

547
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,129
Guys…

548
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,965
The fight has not yet begun.

549
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,436
We have just been brushing off the
sparks that have flown our way.

550
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,604
That wasn't a fight.

551
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,208
It starts after you're prepared
to take it on.

552
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,515
I'm ready for it now.

553
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,554
FROM CHOCO. KEEBOU SOUNDS STRANGE.
I'M GOING TO TOKYO NOW.

554
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,026
Mikki.

555
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,299
Grandma.

556
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:43,968
What should I do?

557
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,710
Who…

558
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,346
are you?

559
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:00,751
I am…

560
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,455
myself.

561
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,158
I will take on the fight

562
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,860
to guard what I treasure.

563
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,332
I…

564
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,834
promised none other…

565
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,004
than Mr. Akagi.

566
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,107
You have to take the exam later?

567
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:27,044
You… The position is not always open!

568
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,980
You might not even get the job!

569
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,915
Then I have to give it up.

570
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:31,916
What?

571
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,986
-I have acted cool once.
-Yes?

572
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,721
If you have acted cool once,

573
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,889
you have to do it
for the rest of your life.

574
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,426
I have promised the person
I'm indebted to.

575
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,263
Let me…

576
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,733
act cool till this ends, Hikari.

577
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,171
I have a button that I want to click too.

578
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,241
Saya.

579
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,543
I love you very much,
so much that I married you.

580
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,679
I really love you,
so I want to be with you forever!

581
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,580
Pichan…

582
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,181
But…

583
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,984
My work often prevents me
from staying home.

584
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,922
That's why I let you buy things.

585
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,525
I want to tie you to me by doing this.

586
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,397
You can buy as many things as you wish,

587
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,032
because I'll work hard to earn the money.

588
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,434
But Saya…

589
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,704
there is a button that
I want to click now, too.

590
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,707
It's a giant one.

591
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,346
Please, let me click this button,
just once!

592
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,548
This is the button that

593
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,084
I click once in a lifetime!

594
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:44,955
Hikari.

595
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,895
I'm going to be a father soon.

596
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,364
<i>I know.</i>

597
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,733
One's own child is more important
than other people's.

598
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,370
But Momoyo…

599
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,506
if our children…

600
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,975
suddenly lose their memories

601
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,977
and got separated from us,

602
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,716
we would pray very hard, wouldn't we?

603
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,786
We'd pray that someone would help them.

604
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,688
We'd desperately hope that someone would.

605
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,559
We would.

606
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,429
I just…

607
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,732
want to be that someone.

608
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,234
Let me answer it,

609
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,404
Hikari.

610
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,273
Your father's prayer.

611
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,480
I want to grow up.

612
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,249
Hang on a second, Toru.

613
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,618
I'm not a kid anymore.

614
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,755
I might look like one,
but I don't want to be a kid.

615
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,858
I don't want to be protected.

616
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,228
I want to protect someone,

617
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,963
like the guys do.

618
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,133
The guys?

619
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,905
People grow up when they carry
something on their shoulders.

620
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,846
Please let me carry you.

621
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:18,949
So that I can grow up.

622
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,460
We are all prepared.
The fight has just started.

623
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,129
Hikari.

624
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,666
We will protect you till the end.

625
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,704
We're not doing this for you.

626
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,742
We do this because

627
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,077
we all want to be ourselves.

628
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,814
That's why we want to protect you.

629
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,392
I'm sorry, Hikari.

630
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:04,695
Sorry…

631
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:06,730
I'm sorry.

632
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,069
We made you carry this burden.

633
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,875
I said that we do this for you,

634
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,611
but actually…

635
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,480
I made myself your burden.

636
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,250
You're just ten years old.

637
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,924
There have been a lot of scary
things and sadness in your life.

638
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,728
They're too heavy for you to carry, right?

639
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,297
Your shoulders are so narrow.

640
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,000
In addition to that,

641
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,703
you have to carry me as a burden.

642
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,140
I didn't even realize this.

643
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,344
And I wanted…

644
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,280
to protect you alone.

645
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,162
Hey…

646
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,197
Please help me.

647
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,299
Keebou!

648
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,468
I can't do this alone.

649
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,104
I know this now.

650
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,307
Please.

651
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,810
Please fight the battle with me.

652
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,315
Please.

653
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,498
We've already told you

654
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,067
that we're all ready to do so.

655
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,004
You never listen to what other people say.

656
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,020
Hikari.

657
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,456
I want to protect you

658
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,125
together with the guys.

659
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,376
Hikari.

660
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,145
You don't have to win.

661
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,315
We will win.

662
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,452
You don't have to carry the burden.

663
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,649
The sky is blue.

664
