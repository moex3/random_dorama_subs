1
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,352
Hikari!

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,955
What are you doing, Hikari? Come here.

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,889
Stop there!

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,559
Lots of people have died…

5
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,262
because of me.

6
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,401
You must have been scared, Hikari.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,375
I'm Matsui. Uncle Keita.

8
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,579
Hikari.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,415
I want to protect you…

10
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,184
together with the guys.

11
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,841
Get down!

12
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,753
Choco!

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,455
Choco!

14
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,790
Choco…

15
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,492
Choco!

16
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,727
-Choco!
-Go away.

17
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,934
-Please call an ambulance.
-Choco…

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,835
Now!

19
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,205
Choco…

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,910
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,018
-Darn!
-Pi, we're in a hospital.

22
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,854
How dare they look down on us?

23
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,456
Why did they shoot Choco?

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,525
It could have been anyone.

25
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,660
If they wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead.

26
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,832
So it was a warning…

27
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:17,971
Guys,

28
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,208
I was really happy when I heard
what you said.

29
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,611
-But if--
-We have all made up our minds.

30
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,050
The battle has started.

31
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,685
Mikki…

32
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,722
We can't… no, we won't quit
after what's happened.

33
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,790
We won't give up before we win.

34
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,798
Who are you?

35
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:49,869
Oh?

36
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,907
-Idiot, this isn't the right time.
-Don't be so dumb!

37
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,408
You don't say that now?

38
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,210
You have to spend three years
to get the gist of it.

39
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,078
Sit down.

40
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,051
Don't worry.

41
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,490
It will be all right.

42
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,668
Hikari, don't worry.

43
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,805
Choco once fell off a motorcycle

44
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,408
and got hit and sent flying
by a dump truck,

45
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,578
but he only got a few scratches
and was alive and kicking.

46
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,416
Even when we fight he has never
been hit in the vital parts.

47
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,218
Because he keeps dodging.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,854
So…

49
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,124
He isn't going to die.

50
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,396
Keebou, you know…

51
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,599
Hikari.

52
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,036
There you go.

53
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,543
Don't worry. He'll live. I saw his wound.

54
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,545
I promise.

55
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:12,018
You will meet your father, too.

56
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,825
Miss Mifumi, thank you very much.

57
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,995
We did nothing but panic.

58
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,466
But I was surprised.

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,601
Why was Choco shot?

60
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,805
You were talking on the roof about
how you'd protect Hikari, right?

61
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,976
Does that mean someone is after Hikari?

62
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,178
Who is it? And why?

63
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,657
Do you not like hot cocoa, Hikari?

64
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,525
I'll have it.

65
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,593
Ouch!

66
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,095
Are you okay? Did you scald yourself?

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,563
Gosh, you wanted it, Hikari?

68
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,432
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,369
It was hot…

70
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,506
Keebou!

71
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,511
The operation was successful.

72
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,413
I think he is all right now.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,016
It helped that the first aid was perfect.

74
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,120
He was lucky that a nurse was there.

75
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,225
ANESTHESIOLOGIST

76
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,064
He was shot?

77
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,133
What, it wasn't you?

78
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,504
I thought better of you because
I thought you did it right away.

79
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,108
That means the other side did it.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,944
Good Lord, those guys are greedy.

81
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,313
Who was shot? Did the guy survive?

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,915
How do I know that?

83
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,376
You came here from Numazu? Sorry
for making you come a long way.

84
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,510
Sir.

85
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,783
I'm allergic to cats.

86
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,185
That is unfortunate.

87
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,590
Hey, Kizaki.

88
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,491
Sir.

89
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,327
Did you not serve tea to our guest?

90
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,428
What…? Guest?

91
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,030
Ouch.

92
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,766
You idiot!

93
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,001
You're all simpletons,

94
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,103
that's why I asked him
to take the trouble to come!

95
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,207
He came from Numazu, the place in
the faraway land of Suruga Province!

96
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,076
I am sorry!

97
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,378
Well, it's not that far away.

98
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,952
Choco!

99
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,687
Choco…

100
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,527
Are you okay, Choco?

101
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,264
I'm not okay,
no matter how you look at it.

102
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,232
Choco!

103
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,134
Idiot! It hurts!

104
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,569
You are the idiot.

105
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,037
You made us so worried.

106
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,573
What? I was the only one who was shot?

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,376
Of course! We all dodged, dunce!

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,145
Dodged? You're not in the Matrix.

109
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,716
-Now, swap.
-Swap?

110
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,886
-Oh, swap.
-Hikari.

111
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,557
Come here.

112
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,131
Sorry for making you worry.

113
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,100
But I'm glad that you're safe.

114
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,637
Don't die…

115
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,207
Don't die!

116
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,309
I won't die.

117
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,444
I don't want any of you to die!

118
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,582
Please don't die! Don't leave me alone!

119
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,688
Hikari, don't cry anymore.

120
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,789
No!

121
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,235
We are from the Shinagawa Minami
police station.

122
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,170
We'd like to talk to you.

123
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,111
INTERROGATION ROOM TWO

124
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,083
We still can't go yet?

125
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,151
I'm worried about them.

126
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,187
There're officers standing by
in front of the hospital room.

127
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,822
I know, but…

128
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,857
Hikari seems…

129
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,129
Please go inside.

130
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,000
Please have a seat.

131
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,639
-I will interview him.
-Yes?

132
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,173
Would you leave us alone for a while?

133
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,109
-But this is--
-Please.

134
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,755
I'm from the Metropolitan Police's
First Investigation Division.

135
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,056
I'm Oshima.

136
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,994
You're Kiichi Segawa, aren't you?

137
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,696
Yes.

138
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,767
You were an important witness to
Inspector Tatsuhiko Akagi's murder.

139
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,739
Oh, don't cry, Hikari.

140
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,508
I'm really all right.

141
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,178
But it was my fault that you were shot.

142
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,648
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,786
Hikari.

144
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,688
Look at me.

145
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm not dead. It's okay.

146
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,028
But…

147
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,166
if one of us gets injured again,

148
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,934
or worse, if we die--

149
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,436
-No!
-Listen.

150
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,972
Remember this.

151
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,741
Even if that happens,

152
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,977
it is not your fault.

153
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,746
All of us…

154
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,984
are here with you because
we decided to do it for ourselves.

155
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,585
Got it?

156
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,957
So this isn't your fault at all.

157
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,196
Even Dad…

158
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,231
What?

159
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,301
Even Dad's death isn't my fault?

160
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,471
Hikari, do you remember what happened?

161
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
When?

162
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,846
When you were shot.

163
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,214
Choco!

164
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,950
-Hey, Choco!
-Can you hear me?

165
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:51,851
Choco!

166
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,919
Then I remembered…

167
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,923
Dad was shot.

168
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,198
He was shot dead.

169
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,771
I'll be frank with you.

170
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,342
I don't think that you killed
Inspector Akagi.

171
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,077
From the case,

172
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,013
I can see the shadow of
an organization that I'm after.

173
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,349
So…

174
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,317
What is that organization?

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,854
I can't tell you.

176
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,924
The Glorious Ark.

177
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,826
Is it?

178
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,730
Please! Tell me.

179
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,331
What is happening?

180
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,868
I'm now working to try
to get the whole picture.

181
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,504
I'd actually like you to tell me.

182
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,907
How did you find that out?

183
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,211
Would you tell me everything
that you have experienced?

184
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,982
What did Keebou and the guys say?

185
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,884
I haven't told them.

186
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,453
Why?

187
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,522
Because there is someone
who I don't trust.

188
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,592
The person is among us?

189
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,330
Who is that?

190
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
Miss Mifumi.

191
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,601
Please leave this to me.

192
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,007
Why?

193
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,210
There have been too many coincidences.

194
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:28,047
<i>She moved next door to Keebou,</i>
<i>and ran into him in Tokyo.</i>

195
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,082
I just find this strange.

196
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,851
Well, you're right.

197
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,286
She has overdone it a bit.

198
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,557
Keebou thought it was a miracle
and was delighted about it.

199
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,459
He's such an idiot.

200
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,863
Also, just now Miss Mifumi…

201
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,599
You will meet your father, too.

202
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,402
I didn't tell Miss Mifumi
that my mom is dead,

203
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,304
but she didn't say I'd meet my mom,

204
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,507
only my dad.

205
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,875
I see.

206
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,577
But I know Keebou will just think
that it's nonsense.

207
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,548
Well, I think you should tell him
once and for all.

208
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,385
If he doesn't listen to you even then…

209
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,357
What should we do?

210
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,494
What are you saying?
Of course it's impossible!

211
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,930
Really, you always do what we expect.

212
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,735
When you were shot Miss Mifumi
worked very hard to save your life.

213
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,270
That's not the point.

214
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,471
That is exactly the point.

215
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,073
How can you suspect someone
who has saved your life?

216
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,477
Do you remember how many times
we have been deceived?

217
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,446
Mr. Akagi, and the class teacher, too.

218
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,916
But Miss Mifumi is different.

219
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,950
Why?

220
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,752
What?

221
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,123
Why is Miss Mifumi different?

222
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,291
Because she's pretty and you like her?

223
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,159
What are you talking about, Hikari?

224
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,294
What's the matter with you?

225
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,765
I mean, Keebou, if you trust her,
that means you don't trust me.

226
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,433
No, that's not the case.

227
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,701
Then why?

228
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,872
It's my intuition.

229
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,540
She is not a wicked person.

230
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,042
Keebou!

231
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,109
It's fine, Choco.

232
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,012
I'll say it.

233
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,747
In front of everybody.

234
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,720
On that day Dad suddenly
came home from work and said

235
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,288
we were going on a road trip.

236
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,024
It was already evening,

237
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,660
so I thought something was wrong.

238
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,498
Bavarois!

239
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,369
Apple pie.

240
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,337
Pie…

241
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,472
Roasted sweet potato.

242
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,243
Roasted sweet potato!

243
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,980
Potato…

244
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,683
You can name any snack you want,
it doesn't have to be sweet. Right?

245
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,060
We'll be there soon.

246
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,097
Did you see the picture I sent you?

247
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,268
I encountered an unbelievably
good opportunity, so now…

248
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,737
Hello?

249
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,472
Hello? Izuka?

250
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,141
Hello?

251
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,215
Izuka!

252
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,818
Glad to see that you are safe.

253
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,087
On my cellphone…

254
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,126
Izuka?

255
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,523
Please help us! Just now,
in the hut up the mountain…

256
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,830
Dad!

257
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,232
Go!

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,201
Go!

259
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,582
I think they ran that way.

260
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,154
Hikari.

261
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,758
Will you do me a favor?

262
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,559
Yes?

263
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:10,896
Take it,

264
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:15,134
and hide it in a safe place.
You can do it, right?

265
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,807
Get away from here after you can't
hear anything, okay?

266
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,610
What about you?

267
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,080
Don't worry about me. Listen.

268
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,616
Hide it straight after you leave here.

269
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,084
You can't keep it with you.

270
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,288
Call my company
when you've hidden the phone.

271
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,724
Ask for Uncle Keita's help.
Don't go to the police.

272
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,460
No, I can't do it. I'm scared.

273
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,496
Don't worry, you can do it.

274
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,767
You are a clever and strong girl.

275
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,571
Dad has faith in you.

276
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,273
Hikari.

277
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,043
Have faith in yourself.

278
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,786
No matter what happens,

279
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,257
no matter how hard
your life is going to be…

280
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,497
you are who you are.

281
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,134
Don't forget that. Overcome
the difficulties and move on.

282
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,911
Dad…

283
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
I'm here.

284
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,030
Dad!

285
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,907
Give me your cellphone!

286
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,880
I've lost it.

287
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,553
Where is the cellphone?

288
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,189
Tell me!

289
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,259
Where is it?

290
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,866
Say it!

291
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,535
It's here!

292
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,538
-Hikari!
-I have the phone!

293
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,240
-Stop there!
-No, Hikari!

294
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,642
Give us the phone!

295
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,978
No, that isn't the phone!

296
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,815
-Let go! Let go at once!
-No!

297
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,587
Dad!

298
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,956
Give us the phone!

299
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>Then they hunted me down to the cliff.</i>

300
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,732
<i>I slipped and fell down.</i>

301
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,470
That's all I can remember.

302
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,107
I was walking on the mountain
before I noticed.

303
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,811
And I'd forgotten everything.

304
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,114
So I don't remember
where my dad's phone is.

305
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,650
It's okay.

306
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,619
It's fine, Hikari.

307
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,155
I'm impressed that you've
recalled it. Well done.

308
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,490
Go and rest, Hikari.

309
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,728
It's okay. I want to go and
look for my dad's phone.

310
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,530
You want to go now?

311
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:37,603
Okay. Let's go now, to Mount Nakane.

312
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,706
Maybe one of us should stay.
I don't want to leave Choco alone.

313
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,873
You don't have to.

314
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,810
-You, stay behind.
-No, I think very soon…

315
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,046
Shuntaro!

316
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,281
What…? Why…?

317
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,116
-So she is Shiho?
-What?

318
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,118
Your cellphone kept ringing,

319
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,087
so I answered it and told her
what happened.

320
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,688
Shuntaro!

321
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,391
-Shuntaro, don't die!
-Ow…

322
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,426
It really hurts, Shiho!

323
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,694
-Ow…
-I'm sorry.

324
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,633
So now I guess none of us
has to stay behind.

325
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,036
Hasn't she gone too far?

326
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,906
Shooting them in the business
district in the middle of Tokyo.

327
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,909
Just make people keep quiet
about this, too.

328
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,145
What is the purpose of your
existence if not for that?

329
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,447
But this time…

330
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,082
there were witnesses.

331
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,884
You can get as many as you want,

332
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,787
I mean, the gangsters who
will take care of business like this.

333
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,692
You mean, get a fake culprit
from among the gangsters?

334
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,096
This country does not need gangsters.

335
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,502
You say they are a necessary evil,
but to sum it up,

336
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,305
they are only pigs that are here
for us to feed rotten meat to.

337
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,942
Humans make the meat rot, that's why
pigs are needed to get rid of it.

338
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,679
So we will just prevent
the meat from rotting.

339
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,448
We'll do a thorough quality control

340
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,317
and create a world that doesn't need pigs.

341
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,987
A very beautiful world.

342
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,762
I'm sorry, Shuntaro.

343
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:19,705
I didn't know, besides doing that,
how to make you--

344
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,374
Don't talk about that now.

345
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:25,877
Kayo…

346
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,183
my friend's grandmother
told me in the past…

347
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,154
that when you're not feeling well,
or when you're hungry or sleepy,

348
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,256
it's better not to talk about
something difficult.

349
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,127
All three apply now.

350
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,731
Anyway, go home for now.

351
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,135
Let's talk about it properly
after I get back.

352
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,803
-But…
-You know…

353
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,844
when I learned that you killed yourself,

354
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,946
frankly, I didn't feel sad.

355
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,350
I just thought, "Gosh, seriously?"

356
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,387
I just felt disgusted.

357
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,156
Shiho.

358
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,160
That's the way I am.

359
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,179
-It's not here.
-Already?

360
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,248
You draw your conclusion too soon.

361
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,316
But it doesn't seem to
be here at a glance.

362
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,352
You just glanced at it?

363
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,687
You know this just by glancing
at the ground?

364
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,122
I don't get what you mean.

365
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,524
Just shut up and search.

366
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,568
Be careful.

367
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,805
-Okay.
-Thanks.

368
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,573
Sorry for making you come with us.

369
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,909
No worries, I'd like to help, too.

370
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,177
Thank you.

371
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,586
Pi, what is that?

372
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,455
A metal detector.

373
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,857
Pichan, why have you got that?

374
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,393
-My wife just clicked "buy."
-Seriously?

375
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,130
Oh, it has finally made its appearance!

376
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,165
Wow, it has detected something!

377
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,567
Really?

378
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,169
Great! We have found something!

379
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,638
Okay, go.

380
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:38,043
I knew that this would happen,
so all my gear is waterproof!

381
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:42,113
-This one, too.
-Your wife bought all of those?

382
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,515
Life must be tough for Pichan.

383
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,317
It has to be here!

384
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,384
Wow…

385
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,353
Found you!

386
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,554
What the heck?

387
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,489
Is it a farce?

388
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,024
Let's pick it up anyway.

389
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,392
It's for the environment!

390
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,597
You're ridiculous.

391
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,501
It's not here.

392
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,770
That's why I said
it was important to glance.

393
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,073
Let's go to the south to look for it
in the afternoon.

394
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,145
Oh, it's a bird.

395
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,453
-Oh!
-What…?

396
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,454
Over there!

397
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,959
There you go, Melos.

398
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,028
Hurry up, Melos!

399
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
You're so heavy…

400
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,164
Can you reach it?

401
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,202
Got it!

402
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,006
-Did your wife buy that too?
-Yeah.

403
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,210
They are in the spotlight all at once.

404
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,511
Okay, let's switch it on.

405
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,784
Try again.

406
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,789
Ah! It's not working.

407
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,525
Well, it has been left exposed
in the wild for days.

408
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,961
I think we can extract the data
in a store.

409
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,497
Okay, let's go and do that.

410
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,206
Hikari?

411
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,512
I'm glad we found it.

412
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,334
Keebou!

413
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,136
Get down, Keebou!

414
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,441
Guys, are you okay?

415
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,575
Yeah.

416
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,913
Guys.

417
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,681
Thanks for your hard work.

418
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,156
Give me the cellphone.

419
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,162
Give me the cellphone.

420
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,164
Freeze!

421
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,801
I won't miss this time.

422
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,438
You are the person who shot Choco?

423
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,574
You…

424
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,675
Ponjara!

425
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,381
Four more shots.

426
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,218
19 shots.

427
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,066
Mr. Segawa…

428
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,035
give it to us.

429
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,743
If you do,

430
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,379
then everything will end here.

431
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,819
Thanks.

432
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,121
For encountering her.

433
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,856
What?

434
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,758
Because you know my younger sister,

435
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,230
the Hierarch picked out
the two of us to do this job.

436
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,835
Our job was easy.

437
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,004
Because you are an idiot.

438
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,739
Right, Mifumi?

439
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,375
It's improbable,
under normal circumstances,

440
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,244
that she moved in
next door to you by chance,

441
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,846
or ran into you in Tokyo.

442
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,582
This is not some comic book for girls.

443
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,185
Didn't I tell you so?

444
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,094
They made you do this, didn't they?

445
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,564
Right?

446
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,632
They made you, right?

447
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,367
If they didn't

448
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:57,969
you wouldn't have--

449
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,938
Why do you still insist that?

450
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,213
I did it willingly.

451
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,248
I wanted to do this.

452
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,753
To make myself useful to the Hierarch.

453
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,888
To purify my soul.

454
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,158
The Glorious Ark?

455
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,828
Yeah.

456
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,364
You can do wicked things
to purify your soul?

457
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,167
Do you seriously believe that?

458
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,168
I do.

459
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,537
Why?

460
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,708
I have…

461
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,945
nothing else that I can believe.

462
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,118
Come on. Give us the phone now.

463
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,390
Give it to them, Keebou.

464
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,828
But your father risked his life to--

465
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,796
It's fine.

466
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,664
Give it to them.

467
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,169
I don't want any more deaths.

468
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,372
You're such a good girl, Hikari.

469
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,609
You are the cleverest among them.

470
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,347
Hikari is right, Keebou.

471
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,449
If you give it to them,

472
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,552
it will end here.

473
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,321
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

474
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,089
-But--
-Keebou!

475
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,858
We win…

476
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,861
when we have protected Hikari,
not the phone.

477
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,136
Believe in yourself!

478
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,372
If you can't…

479
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,210
believe in anyone or anything,
believe in yourself.

480
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,379
I trusted you.

481
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,416
And I trusted myself…

482
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,918
who trusted you.

483
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,526
Enough with your lecture.

484
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,145
I am sorry.

485
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,567
Hikari, I…

486
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,774
Choco.

487
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,142
Sorry.

488
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,578
Mifumi really is…

489
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,680
What?

490
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,283
Hikari?

491
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:06,758
Choco?

492
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,862
Yeah, your plan went well.

493
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,604
Hikari didn't tell you everything.

494
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,273
I told her not to.

495
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,842
<i>We did it to trap the nurse.</i>

496
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,612
Trap her?

497
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,514
At that time…

498
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,549
Where is the cellphone?

499
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,884
Tell me!

500
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,794
MOVING FILES

501
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,381
Paul.

502
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,583
Where is it?

503
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,286
Over here!

504
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,289
-Hikari!
-I've got the phone!

505
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,658
Give me the phone!

506
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,195
Stop there! Give me the phone!

507
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,630
So now the data is…

508
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,866
Paul has it.

509
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,534
Sorry for not telling you.

510
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,404
I told her to do this.

511
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,641
I'm sorry for not telling you guys.

512
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,513
But now the spy is gone.

513
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,518
<i>This will buy us some time.</i>

514
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,423
Okay, let's go look for Paul.

515
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,893
But still, it's difficult to find him.

516
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,995
Oh, Pi, have you got anything
like a dog detector or something

517
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,464
from the stuff your wife bought?

518
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,233
No, that's not something you can find.

519
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,035
<i>I've gathered quite a lot of information.</i>

520
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,973
SHUNTARO: I'M LOOKING FOR A DOG!

521
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,808
I THINK I'VE SEEN A SIMILAR DOG!

522
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:09,947
I KNOW THAT DOG! I SAW A GIRL IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD TAKING CARE OF HIM

523
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,255
Is he Paul?

524
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,257
No.

525
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,325
What time is it?

526
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,028
Paul?

527
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,567
Do… Do something…

528
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,270
Hello, Paul.

529
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,704
Hello.

530
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,341
Paul, don't bark…

531
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,481
Step back. He won't come out
if we are here.

532
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,350
-He is very cautious.
-Yes?

533
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,559
WATCH OUT FOR BEARS!

534
00:34:58,729 --> 00:34:59,664
Paul?

535
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,101
Paul.

536
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,370
Paul.

537
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,409
Paul!

538
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,746
Paul?

539
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,485
Paul?

540
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,086
He is Paul!

541
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,467
Paul has been guarding it.

542
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:40,204
Thank you, Paul! Thank you!

543
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:47,678
Yes?

544
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,014
Oh, the Metropolitan Police's…

545
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,716
Okay.

546
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,484
Segawa.

547
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,387
It seems that
the matter is pretty serious.

548
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:57,822
<i>Do you know something?</i>

549
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,924
No, not yet.

550
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,260
But the case relating
to your friend being shot

551
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,195
is now under press control.

552
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,531
Press control?

553
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,199
<i>Not press restraint,</i>

554
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,567
<i>it's press control.</i>

555
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,768
<i>In other words,</i>

556
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,172
<i>the media weren't even informed</i>
<i>about the gunshot.</i>

557
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,373
So…

558
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,842
Tell me what you guys know.

559
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,746
If you work with me your safety
will be guaranteed by the police…

560
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,416
<i>By me, with all my might.</i>

561
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,051
<i>Please trust me.</i>

562
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,088
Okay.

563
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:32,957
I trust you.

564
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,962
Thank you.

565
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,765
I'll call you again tomorrow…

566
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,407
Oshima.

567
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,743
Are you investigating something secretly?

568
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,083
Oh? Hello?

569
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,818
Mr. Oshima?

570
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,256
What's wrong?

571
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,262
Keebou, who is that?
You said you trusted them?

572
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,098
Oh, he is the policeman
who came to the hospital.

573
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,834
Why? But the police--

574
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,236
He is not a threat.

575
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,137
And your proof is?

576
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,507
He sounds determined…

577
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,377
I just feel that I can trust him.

578
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,880
How many times do you want to be deceived?

579
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:33,117
You've just been deceived by
that woman, don't be stupid.

580
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,086
I still trust her.

581
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:36,887
I mean Miss Mifumi.

582
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,356
What?

583
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,024
Why?

584
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,761
She is not a wicked person.

585
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,631
There must be a reason.

586
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,400
But wasn't she a wicked person?
She was a wicked person!

587
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,534
Hikari…

588
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,436
Keebou…

589
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,440
why do you never trust me
and only trust Miss Mifumi?

590
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,608
That's not true.

591
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,478
I've only got you, and yet…

592
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:09,553
No… Don't do this.

593
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,024
Don't tell the police anything.

594
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,927
Don't say that you trust
Miss Mifumi. Don't say that, Keebou!

595
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:18,829
Hikari…

596
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,300
I trust what I trust.

597
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,971
You're an idiot, Keebou.

598
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,878
I hope she will die, she should!

599
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:34,812
Hikari!

600
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,951
People who say that someone should die…

601
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,820
I don't like them.

602
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,326
Hikari!

603
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,301
CHECKING CORE DATA

604
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,772
No data? That means the photo
isn't stored in it?

605
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,076
Someone has moved the data to an SD card.

606
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,778
The original data
was probably moved there.

607
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,981
Darn!

608
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,084
How dare they give me this crap?

609
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,819
Were you deceived?

610
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,022
Now!

611
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,959
Take it back now! We have no time.

612
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,494
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

613
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,231
Rainman…

614
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,368
Rainman is coming…

615
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,117
CALLER: KEEBOU

616
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,626
I told you to go home.

617
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,128
Answer it, maybe it's urgent.

618
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,366
What's the matter, Keebou?

619
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,702
Choco, we've found the data.

620
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,970
Seriously?

621
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,772
Well done!

622
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,441
We'll take it back first… Oh.

623
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,476
Oh?

624
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,845
-Where is it?
-You're stepping on it, Keebou!

625
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,514
-It's over there.
-Where?

626
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,549
-There.
-Oh, I've found it.

627
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,217
Don't drop it! It's important!

628
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,719
Oh, put it here! You idiot!

629
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,321
-Thanks.
-Idiot! You're definitely an idiot!

630
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,858
You're a bunch of idiots.

631
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,763
Ow… It hurts!

632
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,432
-Shut up!
-What's wrong with that car?

633
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,074
Guys, what's going on?

634
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,345
-Who the heck are they?
-Keebou! Answer me!

635
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,385
Guys… Get down!

636
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,788
Keebou! Hey! Keebou!

637
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,031
Hikari!

638
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,635
Hurry!

639
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,286
Guys!

640
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,756
What the heck is going on?

641
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,499
Give us the data.

642
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,835
Lady, I hope you won't
steal a march on us.

643
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,738
Give that to us!

644
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,108
-Do it!
-Don't be ridiculous!

645
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,377
We found it first.

646
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,620
Mr. Segawa, please understand this.

647
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,491
If you give it to us,
everything will really end.

648
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,195
Hikari can live in safety, too.

649
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,698
Of course, all of you will, too.

650
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,408
No.

651
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,944
Hikari?

652
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,180
No!

653
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,788
No, I won't give it to you.

654
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,191
I won't give it to you… No!

655
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,093
Hikari.

656
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,328
Don't move!

657
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,464
Stupid kid, we'll kill you!

658
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,367
Please talk some sense into Hikari,
Mr. Segawa!

659
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,670
Please!

660
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,357
Give them the data, Hikari.

661
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:14,758
Keebou!

662
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,728
Miss Mifumi is right.

663
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,631
Everything will end
if you give them the data.

664
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,766
Why?

665
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,336
Why do you only listen to Miss Mifumi?

666
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,037
Just give it to them!

667
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,807
You don't even know what it is.

668
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,176
But my dad died for it!

669
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,510
My dad…

670
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,745
Do it now, or I'll kill you!

671
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,746
I'll shoot you!

672
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,483
Please, Mr. Segawa!

673
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,252
Dad asked me to…

674
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,454
That's enough, Hikari!

675
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:46,991
Don't get us involved any further

676
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,659
just because you want
to do what you please!

677
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,570
Come on, Hikari.

678
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,476
You don't want any more deaths, right?

679
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,157
Thank you, Mr. Segawa.

680
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:34,905
Now,

681
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,641
everyone put down their guns.

682
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,790
Okay, listen carefully.

683
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,194
From now on I've got this.

684
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,464
I am your target.

685
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,399
-What?
-Don't be ridiculous!

686
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,735
Of course I won't give it to you.

687
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,705
Hikari, her dad and Paul

688
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,606
risked their lives to guard this!

689
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,477
How can I give it to you?

690
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,481
Hikari.

691
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,452
From now on,

692
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,587
I will exceed your courage.

693
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,129
Jump.

694
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,097
I'll kill you, jerk!

695
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,432
Keebou!

696
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,174
Come with me!

697
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,613
Keebou!

698
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:55,786
NEXT EPISODE

699
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,087
THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED GRADUALLY

700
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,422
THE REAL CULPRIT

701
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,390
SHOCKING LAST SCENE
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
