1
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,284
Hikari.

2
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,123
From now on I will absorb your courage.

3
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,659
Jump.

4
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,627
I'm going to kill you!

5
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,662
Keebou!

6
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,100
Keebou!

7
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,102
Come with me.

8
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:38,872
Keebou!

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,120
Hikari.

10
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,123
He will be all right.

11
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,560
-But he jumped from so high…
-It wasn't the first time.

12
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,496
-Keebou had jumped off there before.
-What?

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,098
-Had he?
-Yeah.

14
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,435
When Choco and I were
at about the same age as Hikari,

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,003
<i>Choco had teased him.</i>

16
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>He said we had jumped off the</i>
<i>year before to test our courage,</i>

17
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,543
<i>and dared Keebou to jump. And then…</i>

18
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,411
<i>Keebou didn't even hesitate…</i>

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,483
That was when Keebou swam to
the shore and found the Villa.

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,984
The Villa?

21
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,522
-I hope it hasn't been torn down.
-It has been ten years, huh?

22
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,394
Oh, there it is!

23
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,630
Okay…

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,600
CAUTION

25
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,803
It's still the way we left it.

26
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,574
-It brings back so many memories.
-This is so cool!

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,076
-This place is…
-When we were in high school,

28
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,078
it was like a sanctuary for us.

29
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,514
When we had to
separate to run away from the police,

30
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,449
we always assembled here afterwards.

31
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,986
WHO ARE YOU

32
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,921
KEEBOU, MIKI

33
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,025
Don't worry. He is Keebou after all.

34
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,431
You guys go and look
over the opposite ridge.

35
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,533
-Yes, madam.
-Futaba.

36
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,938
-Do you know, Futaba…
-What?

37
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,311
Who is trying to get the data and why?

38
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,216
The person who really wants it
isn't the Hierarch, isn't it?

39
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:41,728
I am terribly sorry. I will
definitely get it back.

40
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,102
To realize the ideal country,
even if… I have to sacrifice…

41
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,104
I don't care about your life.

42
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,040
We're running out of time.
Get it back quickly.

43
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,286
PONJARA, PI, MELOS

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,323
Let's move this…

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,128
Somehow this place looks as if you'll
see things like ghosts at night.

46
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,141
-Keebou!
-Whoa, stop there…

47
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,843
I'm soaked. My clothes are dirty.

48
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,118
-You're late.
-How dare you tell me to jump?

49
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,054
I can't fly! I just fell down.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,822
You look like you can fly though.

51
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,526
We've told you, you don't say that now!
Don't be an idiot!

52
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,994
Don't be an idiot…

53
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,229
Don't be an idiot!

54
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,935
-Transferred to another hospital?
-Yes, just now.

55
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,204
The doctor told him to do so after
his condition had stabilized

56
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,906
and he tried to stop him,

57
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,874
but he still wanted to go back home.

58
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,225
FILE FOLDER

59
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,427
CANNOT ACCESS FILE

60
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,695
Why? Is it corrupted?

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,198
I'll take it somewhere to
recover the data.

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,201
-No, it's too risky.
-Exactly, don't be stupid.

63
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,070
It is some important secret, it's the CIA.

64
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,876
-I'll ask Mr. Oshima to do it.
-You mean the police officer?

65
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,381
-I trust Mr. Oshima--
-We know.

66
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,016
Let's do that.

67
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,017
What?

68
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,286
You never listen to what we say anyway.

69
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,856
-Because you're an idiot.
-Just believe what you believe.

70
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,824
We will handle the rest.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,804
Drop it? What are you saying, sir?

72
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,841
About 80,000 people go missing in
this country every year.

73
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,380
79,000 of them are found.
What do you think about the number?

74
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,317
-That is pretty excellent.
-You are right.

75
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,755
However, the remaining 1,000 people
are still missing.

76
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,224
What is your point?

77
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,928
We are already exposed…

78
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,531
You, me, the whole country…

79
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,633
To the ever-continuing…

80
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,569
rain.

81
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,445
Rain?

82
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,348
NUMAZU FIRST GENERAL HOSPITAL

83
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,889
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, Takuya.

84
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,125
You shouldn't play with it
in the corridor.

85
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,128
But it's boring only to
play with it in the room.

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,531
Well, you shouldn't.
If you do it again I'll confiscate it.

87
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,800
-No!
-I guess I'll take it.

88
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,302
Mr. Shuntaro Saeki.

89
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,337
I'll leave it here.

90
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,978
I will get him to his room.

91
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,405
-I like this smell.
-This? The candles?

92
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,573
Yeah, when you blow them.

93
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,475
I like it, too.

94
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,045
It makes me feel happy.

95
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,514
Yeah.

96
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,619
I'd talked about this here in the
past, and Choco said…

97
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,990
"That's because you are fortunate."

98
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,893
He said that it's because I connect
happy memories

99
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,162
like birthdays and Christmas

100
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,232
with the smell that candles make
when you blow them out.

101
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,101
But Choco doesn't?

102
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,007
Before he went to elementary school

103
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,176
his family died in an accident.

104
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,577
What?

105
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,748
He was living in a relative's home
when I first met him.

106
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,685
Maybe he didn't like it there,
so he was always wandering.

107
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,389
When he was in middle school,
he almost never went home.

108
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,661
He used to live quite a precarious life.

109
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,700
<i>Even when he was alone he would</i>
<i>get in a fight picked by others,</i>

110
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,303
<i>or go for the opponent,</i>
<i>the more dangerous the quicker.</i>

111
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,208
<i>He is friendly with people and gets</i>
<i>along with everybody,</i>

112
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,143
<i>but he breaks off with them easily.</i>

113
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,044
CONTACT HAS BEEN DELETED

114
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,314
<i>He sometimes does not seem to</i>
<i>care about himself very much.</i>

115
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,724
I can transfer you to another hospital.

116
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,626
I've just come here.

117
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,128
How brave you are.

118
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,166
Will you talk some sense into Mr. Segawa?

119
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,101
Ask him to give us the data.

120
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,570
Of course I won't, idiot.

121
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:29,208
If he doesn't, everybody, including
Mr. Segawa and you, will be killed.

122
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,311
This is not poison, is it?

123
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,648
Are you scared?

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,592
It is not too late now.

125
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,997
If you give us the data…

126
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,268
What does that data mean to you?

127
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,169
Let go.

128
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,239
Don't get carried away.

129
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,944
I don't die easily.
Make sure you remember this.

130
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,250
<i>Choco and I are the same.</i>

131
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,388
My dad and mom had also died.

132
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,132
On my birthday last year,

133
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,606
my dad went, "Oh, no! A stray dog
took away my present for you!

134
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,508
I'll catch it tomorrow."

135
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,910
What? This is stupid.

136
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,648
My dad was very busy with his work
as a reporter at that time.

137
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,750
I think he just couldn't go and buy it.

138
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,154
So I pretended I was taken in by that.

139
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,423
I told him I'd give it to the dog,

140
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,759
then Dad said he'd surely go
and catch the dog.

141
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,197
I really enjoyed the time with him.

142
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,701
Did you?

143
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,769
Keebou.

144
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,106
On Choco's next birthday,

145
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,609
let's get him candles
and let him blow them out.

146
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,144
Yeah, sure.

147
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,124
Blow it.

148
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,131
-Good night.
-Good night.

149
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,671
You idiot!

150
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,506
I'm sorry!

151
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,242
We will definitely find her this time!

152
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,810
We'll put our lives
in your hands and go all out…

153
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,014
-You're too old, Kizaki.
-Old?

154
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,117
-I don't need you.
-Don't need me? Boss!

155
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,687
-No, Boss! Give me another chance!
-Shut up!

156
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,256
-Tagawa will take over your duties.
-Yes?

157
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:02,028
I'm sorry. I asked you to come a
long way here from Numazu,

158
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,763
and you have to go back so soon.

159
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,865
Well, it's not that far away.

160
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,334
It's time to play that card.

161
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,504
-Card?
-Actually, Tagawa…

162
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,640
We hold a giant card.

163
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,344
A trump card that will make or break.

164
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,048
We don't accept failure.

165
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,650
Well…

166
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,187
It's when we play it that is important.

167
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,493
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

168
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,002
-This is so cool! I'll tweet it.
-Stop being an idiot and let's go!

169
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,140
Why is only Keebou allowed inside?
I'll put you on Twitter, pig!

170
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,710
-Where does that passion come from?
-You're interested in forensics?

171
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,412
-Of course! It's Mariko!
-Mariko?

172
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,147
It's Yasuko Sawaguchi!

173
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,983
Sorry for making you to come
a long way here from Tokyo.

174
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,787
It's okay, the Metropolitan Police
might interfere with the matter,

175
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,889
so I'm glad that we can do it here.

176
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,626
And it is also convenient for me.

177
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,964
Actually, my wife's old home is here,

178
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,666
so she'll come to meet me tonight
after a long time.

179
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,303
-After a long time?
-It's complicated.

180
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,005
I live separately from my wife
and child now.

181
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,210
-Again!
-Choco, you suck at this.

182
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,679
But I can't use this arm.

183
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,448
What has happened to it?

184
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,186
I was shot with a rifle.

185
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:39,558
-That's a lie.
-Then why are you here, Takuya?

186
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,129
They say that this doesn't move properly.

187
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,633
-I see…
-But I'll have surgery soon.

188
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,869
I've been waiting for
my turn for a long time.

189
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,003
I'm happy for you.

190
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,339
-You'll get better.
-Yeah.

191
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,608
After I'm discharged I'll go to school,

192
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,409
and I want to make lots of friends!

193
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,814
Do you? You will very soon.
You seem very nice.

194
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,786
Can you really make 100 friends?

195
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,258
I still haven't got any, because
I've always been in the hospital.

196
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,996
You have, I'm the first one.

197
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,031
-Wow!
-Come on.

198
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,401
Good.

199
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,387
Is that a VIP? He must be.

200
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,100
The Chief is late.

201
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,707
Why…

202
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,910
I will take over and analyze the data.

203
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,680
-Okay…
-Don't give it to him!

204
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,581
What?

205
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,151
Oshima, give me the data.

206
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,786
I won't.

207
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,958
You know what it means if
you refuse to do so.

208
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:20,860
Yes.

209
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,062
I see.

210
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,636
Do you have to point that at us,

211
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,738
Sir?

212
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,274
Now…

213
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,943
Give me the data.

214
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,650
Go now! Darn…

215
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,056
-Sir!
-Get that guy!

216
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,127
Don't attack them!

217
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,062
They're police officers!

218
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,898
Go, Segawa! The data is more important!

219
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,202
Don't let him go!

220
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,743
-Keebou!
-What is he doing?

221
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,644
Those are policemen!

222
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,452
Block all the entrances!

223
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,559
What the heck?

224
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,861
It's difficult to fight with the police.

225
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,965
-But we've promised to handle the rest.
-Mikki!

226
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,733
-I'm Melos!
-Hey!

227
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,370
Get lost!

228
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,640
You…

229
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:19,712
Don't move!

230
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,914
Keebou!

231
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,284
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry, Keebou.

232
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,352
Get lost!

233
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,989
Are you all right? Okay, let's go.

234
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,490
Stop there!

235
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,293
Go!

236
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,566
Get in now!

237
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,577
Stop being an idiot!

238
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,618
Freeze!

239
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,087
I'll shoot if you don't.

240
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,857
Get in.

241
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,663
The police are not allowed to fire
at citizens with no weapon.

242
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,532
Only warning shots.

243
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,770
Oshima!

244
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,808
Even if you do that

245
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,444
the rain still won't stop.

246
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,680
I won't go under your umbrella.

247
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,350
I choose to get soaked…

248
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,053
and walk with them.

249
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,258
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

250
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,832
I'm very sorry that I've made you…

251
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,367
Please don't say that.

252
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,804
Never mind us, will you be okay?

253
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,871
I'll be fine.

254
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,075
Not the whole police force
has been corrupted. I'll manage.

255
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,244
I'm more worried about you guys.

256
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,414
Will we be put on the wanted list?

257
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,718
No, you won't. The chaos this time
will probably be covered up.

258
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,621
-What a relief.
-No.

259
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,290
This is worse.

260
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,928
You could be secretly hunted down.

261
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,101
I'm terribly sorry!

262
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,573
To analyze this,

263
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,842
we have to find a specialized agency
that is trustworthy.

264
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,777
I will take it until we find one.

265
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,646
Then you'll be exposed to less danger.

266
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,449
No, Mr. Oshima, I'll keep it…

267
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,952
-But…
-I've promised…

268
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,754
That I will take this on.

269
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,130
Okay.

270
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,199
But be very careful.

271
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,001
I will.

272
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,038
Detective…

273
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,842
Will they go after our families?

274
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,114
I don't think they will
go after your families.

275
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,384
Their goal is not to
threaten you or give you a warning.

276
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,220
It is to eliminate you guys.

277
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,722
Eliminate?

278
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,924
But I can't deny that it's possible

279
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,360
that they'll get involved
when the police hunt you down.

280
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,533
I think we'd better leave
our families for now.

281
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,303
Keebou.

282
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,539
Can I…

283
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,341
Can I go home just once?

284
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,045
Of course! And you guys, too.

285
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:46,919
HAYASHIDA LAUNDRY SHOP

286
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,987
-Oh, Noriaki?
-Hey.

287
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,423
Aren't you supposed to be
delivering the clothes?

288
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,025
Well, yeah…

289
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,826
I'm going out soon, though.

290
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,495
What are you doing?

291
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,398
I've thought about our babies' names.

292
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,235
Break up the word "hope"
into the two kanjis,

293
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,137
so it'll be "Ki" and "Bou".

294
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,505
HOPE

295
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,007
How do you read them?

296
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,711
It's not going to be
"Ki" and "Bou", is it?

297
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,112
Of course not!

298
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,682
It's Nozomi.

299
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,419
-Which one?
-Both.

300
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:24,656
No… I don't get it. You mean both
babies will be called Nozomi?

301
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,063
Oh, that's what it will become!

302
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,765
I thought I had a great idea!

303
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:37,970
Gosh, get a grip, daddy.

304
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,908
It's okay, just take some time
to think about it.

305
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,280
We'll decide them after they're born.

306
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,850
Okay, Noriaki?

307

I'm ready now, Pichan!

309
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,328
Have a seat… Okay.

310
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:13,772
Chappy loves Pichan very much!

311
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,008
The end.

312
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,579
-Tell me… How did I do?
-Saya…

313
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,515
Ventriloquists close their mouths
when they speak.

314
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,151
You can't speak with your mouth shut.

315
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,186
Well… Yeah, but…

316
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,889
-Pichan, show me, then.
-Saya.

317
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,925
I'd like to talk to you about something.

318
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,327
Pichan.

319
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,231
Thank you…

320
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,402
For letting me buy so many things.

321
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,637
Yes?

322
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,807
I've already got lots of things.

323
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,910
You have bought me everything I want.

324
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,781
So it's your turn now.

325
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,183
Saya…

326
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,053
From now on,

327
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,891
the button you want to click
is the button that I will click.

328
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,002
Pichan… Are you crying?

329
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,541
Don't cry. You'll make me cry, too.

330
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,880
-Toru.
-I'll stay at my friend's place.

331
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,919
Will you? You have made some good friends?

332
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,922
-I'm so happy for you.
-Listen.

333
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,724
-Yeah?
-Go to where Dad is.

334
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,126
-Yes?
-To Singapore.

335
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,595
Right…

336
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,564
I have a suggestion!

337
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,966
-Let's go on our summer vacation…
-Will you stop that?

338
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,301
Don't treat me like a kid.

339
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,770
You're so annoying, seriously!

340
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,873
Please, just go to where Dad is.

341
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,110
I really can't live with
a strange woman alone.

342
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,913
-A strange woman…
-We're not related, are we?

343
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,248
No matter how you think about it.

344
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,218
I don't even want to see you.

345
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,687
Just go! Get lost from now on!

346
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,832
I'm sorry!

347
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,571
I'm so sorry!

348
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,240
CARE HOME FOR THE ELDERLY, SUNNY SQUARE

349
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,821
We will take care of her
during her stay here.

350
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,091
-Thank you very much.
-It's our job.

351
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:53,765
Oh, right. After my grandmother
finishes half her meal,

352
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:58,437
she takes a break to
switch on the TV or fold origami,

353
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,273
but she starts eating again,
so please don't take her meal away.

354
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,474
Okay.

355
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,277
-And when my grandma sleeps…
-Mr. Miki.

356
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,614
Don't worry.
Please let us take care of her.

357
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,417
Okay.

358
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,820
Kayo, where are you going?

359
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,155
Grandma.

360
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,790
What's the matter?

361
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,495
I have to go and help Kosuke.

362
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,631
Because Kosuke
is fighting with the others again.

363
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,603
You will help him?

364
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:38,710
You know, the boy
is actually a real softie.

365
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:49,020
-You'll go on leave for a long time?
-Please let me do that!

366
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,957
Are you disrespecting your job?
You skipped your exam, and…

367
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:56,027
-I'm terribly sorry!
-That's enough! I'm firing you!

368
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,131
Hey, hang on…

369
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,300
FISH

370
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,009
-Miss Moriyama.
-Yes?

371
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,645
Thank you for everything.

372
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,415
-What's the matter?
-I…

373
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,952
I really loved you!

374
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,554
Yes?

375
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,090
When everything went wrong
and I felt very down,

376
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,525
and when everything seemed pointless,

377
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,561
I could cheer up again
just after having a glimpse of you.

378
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,930
That's what you were to me.

379
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,200
So thank you very much!

380
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,902
MORIYAMA

381
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,913
<i>I don't think they will</i>
<i>go after your families,</i>

382
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,347
<i>but I can't deny that</i>

383
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,483
<i>they will get involved when the</i>
<i>police hunt you down.</i>

384
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,717
<i>Can I…</i>

385
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,520
Can I go home just once?

386
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,391
Keebou!

387
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,962
-Hikari!
-Keebou!

388
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,265
Chancellor!

389
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,700
Why?

390
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,003
Do you think I don't know this place?

391
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,242
Don't worry, I haven't told anyone.
I've come alone.

392
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,910
For what?

393
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,946
Will we bring this to a conclusion?

394
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,914
I guess you guys are sick of it, too.

395
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,721
Aihara, give us the data.

396
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,993
I guess you know this as well,

397
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,596
that someone is competing
with us for that.

398
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,732
It's the Glorious Ark,

399
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,667
which appears to
be a religious organization,

400
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,636
but actually is a group of
psychotic killers.

401
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:50,709
If you give them the data,
there will be serious consequences.

402
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,613
-Serious consequences?
-But if we get it,

403
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,450
we can crush both the group

404
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,019
and the people who control them
all together.

405
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,496
Give us the data. I'll see that you
don't lose anything by it.

406
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,499
-If you do…
-How can I trust you?

407
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,802
I won't be deceived again.
I don't believe what you said.

408
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:26,077
If you give us the data
we'll release the hostage.

409
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,279
Hostage?

410
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,353
Dad!

411
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,254
What?

412
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,757
<i>Hikari, are you all right?</i>

413
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:45,630
<i>I heard that you have lost</i>
<i>your memory, and I'm very worried.</i>

414
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,932
<i>I have…</i>

415
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,136
<i>really put you through a tough time.</i>

416
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,072
<i>I'm sorry, Hikari.</i>

417
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,409
-<i>Forgive me.</i>
-What is this?

418
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,146
-I thought Hikari's dad was dead?
-He is alive.

419
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,448
He is staying at the main branch.

420
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,554
It's pointless to show you that
when her memory was lost.

421
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,456
I only heard about it yesterday as well.

422
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,630
Tonight at nine, bring the data
with you to our club.

423
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,932
You'll exchange it for the girl's dad.

424
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,139
I'll see that
you don't lose anything by it.

425
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,175
Trust me.

426
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,743
Keebou.

427
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,324
I'm sorry, your family is going
through a hard time and…

428
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,694
It's not your fault at all.
I should be the one to…

429
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,766
This is unusual. Maybe someone is here.

430
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,135
What are you doing?

431
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:58,770
Dad!

432
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,506
Takuya.

433
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,576
-What… Why?
-Why?

434
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,518
Isn't it fishy? No matter how
you think about it.

435
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,455
That means we'll side with
the gangsters, right?

436
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,627
Chancellor said we wouldn't lose
anything, and more importantly,

437
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,963
Hikari's father can come back.

438
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,266
Will you go?

439
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,272
Keebou.

440
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,710
We don't hate that part of you.

441
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,179
But…

442
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:43,982
Is that all right?

443
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,952
Hikari's dad did everything
to guard the data,

444
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,155
and you're giving it away.

445
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,427
Does her father really want us to do that?

446
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,696
And you're going alone, too.

447
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,500
-That's too reckless, Keebou.
-But…

448
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,403
What if he has deceived you?

449
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,474
They will get the data,

450
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,076
and both Hikari's dad and
you could still be killed!

451
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,547
Then what have we been guarding it for?

452
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,282
We've made the gangsters, a heresy group,

453
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,883
and even the police into our enemies,

454
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,652
and we have destroyed
everything important to us, too!

455
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,588
-Say something, Keebou!
-Melos.

456
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,225
Chancellor saved us
at that time, didn't he?

457
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,362
I trust Chancellor.

458
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,202
-But what if it was a lie?
-Then I have been deceived.

459
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,505
That's what trust is.

460
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,283
This isn't like you at all, Keebou.

461
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,053
Are you going there to be defeated?

462
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,789
Of course not! I'm going there to win.

463
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,593
How can we win this battle? Tell us.

464
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,463
What are we fighting for?

465
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,348
Hikari will…

466
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,818
just like every ordinary child,

467
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,422
she will be carefree and
can be happy every day.

468
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,993
I will fight for that.

469
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,163
That is our victory.

470
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,402
So…

471
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,207
I will go to meet Hikari's father.

472
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,851
Okay… Keebou.

473
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,288
Believe in whatever you believe in.

474
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,790
We won't let you go alone.

475
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,670
Hey, now is the time.

476
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,539
It's now.

477
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,408
Yeah.

478
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,211
Who are you?

479
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,213
I am myself!

480
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,220
Why have you transferred
to another hospital?

481
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,790
And you didn't even tell us.

482
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,627
Enough about me.

483
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,831
-She is back, just as I thought.
-Who is back?

484
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,467
-The nurse, Mifumi.
-What?

485
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,904
-We'll get out of here at once.
-Don't worry.

486
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,741
I'll be the bait, then maybe we can
get some information out of her.

487
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,277
-What nonsense are you saying?
-I won't be killed easily.

488
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,984
Anyway, I'll tell Mr. Oshima
about this first.

489
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,132
-Mr. Oshima.
-Yes?

490
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,002
Takuya's operation on his heart
in three days

491
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,337
will be canceled.

492
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,373
Canceled?

493
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,776
Why?

494
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,446
After looking at
all the results of the tests,

495
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,981
the hospital has reached this decision.

496
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,284
But he did all the tests ages ago
and there was no problem…

497
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,154
It's no use transferring
to another hospital.

498
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,361
None of the hospitals that can perform
such a high level heart operation,

499
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,563
no matter where you go in Japan,

500
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,298
will admit Takuya

501
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,467
You…

502
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,270
It's the Glorious Ark?

503
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,106
What on earth are you?

504
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,976
You have control over not only the police,

505
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,311
but even the medical service?

506
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,315
Why can you do this?

507
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,319
Mr. Oshima, I think you know that…

508
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,659
There is only one way to let the
operation be performed as scheduled.

509
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,062
Give me the data.

510
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,935
If you don't it will be too late.

511
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,472
Takuya's life…

512
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,217
Please save his life.

513
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,062
Sorry for making you take the trouble.

514
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,601
Where is Hikari's father?

515
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,902
Where is the data?

516
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,372
You have got it with you, right?

517
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,557
I knew it.

518
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,461
An excellent police officer like you

519
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,165
would be carrying the real data himself.

520
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,109
Bring him here.

521
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,523
Are you… Hikari's father?

522
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,259
Are you Kiichi Segawa?

523
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,260
Yes.

524
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,897
Thank you for protecting Hikari.

525
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,166
I haven't done this alone.

526
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,936
Then where is Hikari now?

527
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,539
My friends are protecting her.
Please don't worry.

528
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,212
There are still young people
like you guys…

529
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,684
You are the last hope of this country.

530
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,520
We're not that good. We're just stupid.

531
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,155
Hold on, young man.

532
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,258
Give me the data first.

533
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,797
Give me the data.

534
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,242
Don't give it to her!
Don't believe her lies.

535
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,310
Please! Give it back to me!

536
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,579
Give it back to me!

537
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,052
Can I give it to him?

538
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,889
It is better than
giving it to the Glorious Ark.

539
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,861
Because it's Rainman
who is controlling them.

540
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,463
Rainman?

541
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,165
Rainman has control over everything,

542
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,901
a fixer who is trying to make this
a country of statism.

543
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,171
-Anyone who disrupts order will be--
-Talk later.

544
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,441
Give me the data.

545
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,803
The Glorious Ark!

546
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,916
Give it back to me…

547
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,117
Give it back to me!

548
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,722
-Ponjara!
-Choco!

549
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,530
Takuya has taken a sudden turn for
the worse, please call the doctor!

550
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,597
Okay.

551
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,585
President! Why?

552
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:21,158
If you give Rainman the data,
the gangs will be destroyed in a second!

553
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,194
That's not called destroyed.

554
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,632
-It's cleansing.
-Cleansing?

555
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,637
When you wash a futon
covered in mites and dust,

556
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,273
you don't call it destruction, do you?

557
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,508
Exactly.

558
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,678
Everybody wants to sleep in a clean futon.

559
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:46,150
In a clean room,
where the air is conditioned.

560
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,633
They've got me…

561
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,637
Rainman's power has
even reached the underworld…

562
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,011
Ryugasaki, how is
the retrieval of the data going?

563
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,948
If the worst comes to the worst
our dream will be at risk.

564
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,116
Arisugawa,

565
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,951
Irori,

566
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,722
it's unusual for you to be so fearful.

567
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,058
There is no problem.

568
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,730
Everything is in order.

569
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,100
As long as you have
the sense of righteousness

570
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,702
and the strong power to achieve it.

571
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,373
Chancellor.

572
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,044
-Did you know that?
-Of course.

573
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,580
He is new.

574
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,417
A man who is suitable to
live in the new world.

575
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,389
-The new world?
-A clean futon, my boy.

576
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,624
A world where everything is clean.

577
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,930
A beautiful world designed using
order and regulation.

578
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,065
In the world,

579
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,702
nothing is outside the norm.

580
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,873
Gangs are a typical example. Of course,

581
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,510
uncivilized dunces like you
are not wanted as well.

582
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,847
You mean you'll kill us?

583
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,353
Chancellor.

584
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,457
I don't get what
these guys are talking about at all.

585
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,894
Do you understand them?
What's wrong with you?

586
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,130
They're nothing but a group of killers!

587
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,099
They have no justice nor humanity.

588
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,168
And yet you have joined them?

589
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,871
-Are you out of your mind?
-I've told you, Aihara.

590
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,576
-This is all I can do.
-Of course not! Have you forgotten?

591
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,882
You had led 100 daredevils!
It was 1000 if you count the union too.

592
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,251
-You--
-It's not a children's game.

593
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:05,189
I have to survive.
I have to do it for them, too.

594
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,925
What is the point of
surviving in such a world?

595
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,296
Is that a world you'll enjoy?
Answer me, Chancellor!

596
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,732
It's not about whether I like it or not!

597
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,070
It's life or death.

598
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,641
I know you're going to
say you'd rather die.

599
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,445
You're happy to go and stand in
the pouring rain, aren't you?

600
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,250
But I need an umbrella.

601
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,120
Aihara…

602
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,188
That's my caliber.

603
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,591
Tagawa.

604
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,227
You really are new.

605
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,798
Now, this is the beginning of
the new world.

606
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,001
Hang on!

607
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,606
I have used…

608
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,908
a complicated way to lock the data.

609
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,647
When you input the three passwords,

610
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,316
if you get even one wrong,

611
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,917
the data will disappear.

612
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,157
After all this time…

613
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,625
That's ridiculous!

614
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,494
If you want me to unlock it,

615
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,363
Let me see Hikari.

616
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,765
Please.

617
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,567
I hope you'll…

618
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,136
grant me my last wish.

619
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,970
Don't give up until you win!

620
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:22,993
Dad!

621
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,161
Hikari…

622
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,198
Dad!

623
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,602
Dad!

624
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,211
No…

625
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,250
-She is not Hikari.
-What?

626
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,187
She isn't Hikari… She isn't my daughter!

627
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,757
Where is Hikari?
Where have you hidden her?

628
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,260
How can that…

629
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,187
Who… are you?

630
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,056
<i>Too bad. You found out.</i>

631
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,858
<i>Rainman will go that far?</i>

632
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,394
<i>Sorry it has to be this way.</i>

633
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,563
Miki! Who are you?

634
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,864
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
