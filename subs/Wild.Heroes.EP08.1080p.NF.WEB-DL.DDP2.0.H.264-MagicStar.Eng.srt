1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:02,635
Dad!

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:04,871
Dad!

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,441
No.

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,645
-She is not Hikari.
-What?

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,314
She is not my daughter!

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,817
Where is Hikari?
Where have you hidden her?

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,990
Who… are you?

8
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,111
Oops, he outed me.

9
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,646
Of course.

10
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,516
I can't possibly mistake you
for my real daughter.

11
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,486
-Have you all been deceived?
-But…

12
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,655
Where did you find a girl
who looks exactly like…

13
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,591
Don't tell me… She has received
plastic surgery?

14
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,994
You put a little girl through that?

15
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,596
Rainman has even done something
that cruel?

16
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,369
I'm sorry, Keebou, for deceiving you.

17
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,939
Just like what that lady said,

18
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,211
It was easy to deceive you,
because you're an idiot!

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,250
You weren't even aware of it at all
and helped me with all your might.

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,955
Thank you for even making stewed
beef for me.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,598
She lied about something that
Keebou would know was a lie.

22
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:43,303
I mean the stewed beef. She did it
to let us know that she was lying.

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,084
What the heck, stupid kid?

24
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,286
You had all of us at your beck and call!

25
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,924
Where is the real Hikari?

26
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,693
Where have you hidden her?

27
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,928
My daughter…

28
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,763
Let me see Hikari!

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,367
Shut up! Tell us the passwords now!
Or I'll kill you.

30
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,603
Kill me if you want.

31
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,638
The data…

32
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,708
will remain locked.

33
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,280
Have you any clue where she is?

34
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,557
The deadline is approaching.

35
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,325
I don't know what has happened,

36
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,195
but if she is a fake, then we should
find the real one first.

37
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,230
Where do you think?

38
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,667
It's either the basement of the
mountain villa

39
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,702
or the boathouse in Mount Nakane.

40
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,538
I told her to stay there
if anything happened.

41
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:55,508
There is enough food, it's probable that
she'd do as she was told and stay there

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,111
because she is a clever girl.

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,149
You guys will go with them.

44
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,651
Mr. Sendagi.

45
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,787
Don't worry about that.

46
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,523
We will take care of this.

47
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,292
We'll go, too, just in case.

48
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,561
-Go now.
-Yes, sir…

49
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,665
Are you worrying that we will steal
a march on you?

50
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,201
When you have been in a business that
involves violence for a long time,

51
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,436
you become very cautious.

52
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,705
You can't do anything about it, then.

53
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,441
Because this has been ingrained

54
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,077
in your character.

55
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,550
We can deal with their number now.

56
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,688
Three per person.

57
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,391
Let's go.

58
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,461
-Tagawa.
-Yes, sir.

59
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,164
Kill the kid.

60
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,802
What…

61
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,404
It doesn't matter, does it?

62
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,140
She is a stranger to you.

63
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,745
With all due respect,

64
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,382
but if Rainman is behind this and we
kill her, wouldn't it be a problem?

65
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,251
I'll say this for future reference,
Tagawa.

66
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,321
You're not the one to decide that, I am.

67
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,790
Just go and do it!

68
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,806
That's it, Tagawa.

69
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,343
My will is yours.

70
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,813
-Kill her!
-Chancellor!

71
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,053
Dad!

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,258
I knew it.

73
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,161
You deceived us?

74
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,531
This is absurd.

75
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,768
Tell us how to unlock the data now!

76
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,436
Mr. Sakaki.

77
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,105
Let me handle this.

78
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,241
Tagawa.

79
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,978
Shoot her in the limbs first.

80
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,579
Right leg.

81
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,882
Left leg.

82
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,617
Right arm.

83
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,952
Left arm.

84
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,255
-No!
-The way to unlock it!

85
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,393
-Chancellor!
-Tagawa!

86
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,195
-Shoot!
-No!

87
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,898
I'll say it… I will tell you!

88
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,850
-What are you doing, idiot?
-Shut up, old man.

89
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,454
I'll stay true to myself.

90
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,389
Chancellor…

91
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,028
There are rules to obey when you fight.

92
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:07,200
Never betray your friends and never
harm women and children.

93
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,339
-Don't move! Or I'll kill him!
-Stop there!

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,379
Go! Take the kid and her dad and run.

95
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,681
-But, Chancellor…
-Don't mind me, just go!

96
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,421
-Don't let them go!
-I told you not to move!

97
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,125
If you want to kill him,

98
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,762
do it, then.

99
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,597
What was that, jerk?

100
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,465
Aren't you working together?

101
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,433
We work together?

102
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,836
Please don't get this wrong.

103
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,439
We are not at the same rank.

104
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,610
You are under me.

105
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,245
Of course you are.

106
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,616
Why would you, a barbarian,
and me, the messenger of God,

107
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,651
be standing on the same stage?

108
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:05,491
Do you really think someone like you
will be useful to our ideal country?

109
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,894
You are barking mad.

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,131
Capture the father

111
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,334
and make him tell us the way
to unlock the data.

112
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,137
Hikari!

113
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,679
Hikari!

114
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,881
You, too!

115
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,783
Are you sure?

116
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,319
If you don't stay loyal to your president

117
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,190
you can't go anywhere later
after the old man dies or I die.

118
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,660
How foolish…

119
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,629
you gangsters are.

120
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,372
You…

121
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,242
Don't think you can live after this.

122
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,214
If I can't go by tomorrow, I'll have
to pay a late fee for my DVD.

123
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:02,882
Hikari!

124
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,518
Get lost!

125
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,355
-Chancellor!
-Just go!

126
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,158
Sorry, I've never been able to
help you much.

127
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,160
That's not the case at all!

128
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,462
You've helped us a lot, Chancellor!

129
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,597
Go!

130
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,208
How dare you, jerk?

131
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,610
What are you doing?

132
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,352
Sorry, Tenten, please pull over.

133
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,420
Why?

134
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,128
-Miki, you have to use the toilet?
-I'm going back.

135
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,163
What are you saying, Miki?

136
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,698
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,734
-Why, Miki?
-You're returning for Chancellor?

138
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,508
-I'll go with you.
-No.

139
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,043
It's easier to go alone.

140
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,213
-You can't do that alone!
-No, Miki…

141
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,048
Miki.

142
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,018
Who are you?

143
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,591
I am myself.

144
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,796
-Get Chancellor out of there.
-Sure.

145
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,198
-Miki!
-Miki!

146
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,573
Idiot!

147
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:40,746
Hey.

148
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,283
I didn't know you were so old.

149
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,819
I'm disappointed, Tagawa.

150
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,255
How dare you…

151
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,624
I've always wanted to do this.

152
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,126
Because someone did it to me
the other day.

153
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,096
Kill him 100 times and bury him!

154
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,266
You idiot, Tagawa!

155
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,674
Hikari.

156
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,677
You have…

157
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,947
done very well.

158
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,287
Dad!

159
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,455
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,957
I'm sorry, Hikari.

161
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,159
Dad…

162
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,094
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,364
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,799
I want to go back there.

165
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,534
For Miki?

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,605
Miki will be all right.

167
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,807
I know Miki is very strong,

168
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,176
but he can't fight so many people
on his own.

169
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,546
You know,

170
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,685
when Miki says that,
"It's easier to go alone,"

171
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,654
then it's really better for him to
do it alone.

172
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,857
Then he'll win in a second and come back.

173
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,259
-Right?
-Yeah, it's Miki's…

174
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,763
"It's easier to go alone" legend,
isn't it?

175
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,903
Hey!

176
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,439
It's too early to pass out, idiot.

177
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,641
Get yourself together!

178
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,745
-We haven't finished with you!
-Get up…

179
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,750
I've put you through such a tough
time, haven't I?

180
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,354
This is…

181
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,790
I'm at a loss for words.

182
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,859
Please don't say that, Mr. Goto.

183
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,228
At that time, too…

184
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,964
<i>I thought if I called Hikari there,</i>

185
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,901
<i>then your friends would come with you,</i>

186
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,706
then I might manage to run away
from there.

187
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,976
-I bet on that possibility.
-I knew it.

188
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,214
You are the last hope of this country.

189
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,050
Please. I hope you'll…

190
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,519
grant me my last wish.

191
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,522
So that was what your words meant.

192
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,929
Hikari, well done for knowing

193
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,931
that I was lying.

194
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,566
I knew it at once.

195
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,668
Because I am who I am.

196
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:21,040
I thought you must have a reason
for lying there,

197
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,910
so I pretended that I was not Hikari.

198
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,847
Did you?

199
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,716
Just like my last birthday.

200
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,085
Oh, you mean the present?

201
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,493
Hikari's wit

202
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,728
has protected us many times.

203
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,500
What? Protected? I protected you guys?

204
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,907
What are you going to do then?

205
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,345
I think we will escape abroad for a while.

206
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,748
I have put our passports and
necessities in a trunk room

207
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,284
near the airport if the crunch comes.

208
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,318
I see.

209
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,891
But I hid the key in the mountain villa,

210
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,794
I hope they didn't take it…

211
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,997
Oh, Keebou, the keys!

212
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,269
These ones?

213
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,306
This is the key!

214
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,443
-You're a lifesaver! Thank you!
-Don't mention it.

215
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,114
But Mr. Goto, the data

216
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,084
was still taken by the Glorious Ark
in the end. Sorry for that.

217
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,887
-No, it isn't your fault.
-But…

218
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,958
It was a golden opportunity to bring
Rainman to the light, but…

219
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,528
In the end,

220
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,332
perhaps this is our fate.

221
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,344
Let's go.

222
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,346
Sorry…

223
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,582
Please let us go with you…

224
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,978
Sorry to interrupt, but can I borrow that?

225
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,780
-What?
-Make a call.

226
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,251
-Who should I call?
-You, of course! Do it now.

227
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,121
Thanks. I'll call you after
I finish using it.

228
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,556
It's for the taxi.

229
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,393
And this is for your hotel room.

230
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,096
Have fun.

231
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,866
Let's go to a hotel.

232
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,568
Sure!

233
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,125
<i>Aren't you guys too cold to Miki?</i>

234
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,595
If it were Keebou, you'd have gone to
rescue him ages ago.

235
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,431
That's because Keebou always makes
us worried.

236
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,601
-He cries very easily.
-He's good at fighting, though.

237
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,807
Miki is all right on his own.

238
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,748
Miki named us Who Are You.

239
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,719
There are three things that are
important to him.

240
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,589
Wind,

241
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,125
love,

242
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,628
and friends,

243
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,599
I know what love and friends mean,
but what is wind?

244
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,936
He said "wind" meant freedom.

245
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,773
-Freedom?
-Yeah.

246
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,943
<i>There is a fine line between</i>
<i>love and friends,</i>

247
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,812
<i>and restraints and fetters.</i>

248
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,847
<i>So he told us to never forget</i>

249
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,417
<i>that we have to let others and</i>
<i>ourselves be as free as the wind.</i>

250
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:34,560
To give another person freedom means
that you have to trust them, Melos.

251
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,931
As in, I trust you so I'll let you
do whatever you please.

252
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,806
Oh, stop worrying about him!

253
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,876
He never does anything blindly.

254
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,545
He acts when the timing is right.

255
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,016
Well, he used to be pretty
hotheaded, both Choco and him.

256
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,650
What do you mean?

257
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,753
He would be beside himself when
he saw red.

258
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,688
They were a mad dog duo.

259
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,189
That is surprising.

260
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,992
Then Keebou came up with what we
always say.

261
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,561
Like reminding them not to get
carried away and go to pick a fight.

262
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,929
It's what we say before we fight,

263
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,766
<i>Who are you?</i>

264
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,340
Idiot!

265
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,641
Get up!

266
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,676
You can't get up?

267
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,886
You look so pitiable, Mr. Chancellor.

268
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,389
People said you were the strongest
when you were a kid, right?

269
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,125
You were unbeatable in the
countryside, huh?

270
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,100
Unbeatable is an overstatement.

271
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,337
There were people who
I couldn't beat easily.

272
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,474
You still have the energy to talk, huh?

273
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,114
Especially when…

274
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,017
he was still called a mad dog.

275
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,933
Who the heck are you?

276
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,303
I am myself.

277
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,985
Idiots.

278
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,672
Who… You're…

279
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,646
Ouch!

280
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,652
I see you're awake.

281
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,322
What is this, a dream?

282
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,393
Stop blowing that.

283
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:56,828
Ponjara!

284
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,733
The wound required quite a few stitches,

285
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,101
but the result of his
brain scan came back normal.

286
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,104
How did he get injured?

287
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,541
-I was going to give the data…
-What?

288
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,878
My son has a heart disease,

289
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,848
and someone from the Glorious Ark
told me to give them the data

290
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,017
if I want my son's operation performed.

291
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,787
I was going to give it to her.

292
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,489
Then this happened…

293
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,627
I'm really sorry!

294
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,495
Hang on a minute…

295
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,465
But I had the data…

296
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,634
<i>This data is not real?</i>

297
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,436
What do you mean, Mifumi?

298
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,638
<i>It was swapped.</i>

299
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,941
<i>Mr. Segawa didn't realize that,</i>

300
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,177
<i>and he gave it to you.</i>

301
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,411
Where is the real data?

302
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,114
Do you know where it is?

303
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,387
Yes, I do.

304
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,423
I didn't do it because I didn't trust you.

305
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,058
It's a police officer's little trick,

306
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,261
when we have to guard some important data.

307
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,197
I'll keep it until then.

308
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
I think I should keep it.

309
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,939
-Oh, that was when…
-Yeah.

310
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,877
You saved the day, Mr. Oshima. Thank you!

311
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,045
Why?

312
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,148
Actually, our SD card was taken away.

313
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,184
-Was it?
-So where is the real one now?

314
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,787
That's…

315
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,660
NUMBER WITHHELD

316
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:38,764
Yes?

317
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,267
What?

318
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,420
Look.

319
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,694
Miki!

320
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,895
Hey, Melos.

321
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,498
Ow…

322
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,335
What's the matter? I just didn't
come back last night. Let's go.

323
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,838
Hey.

324
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,212
WHO ARE YOU

325
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,183
Mifumi.

326
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,889
Futaba.

327
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,659
I told you to come alone!

328
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,794
Where is the data? We have no time.

329
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,570
I haven't got it with me now.

330
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,407
Then why did you call me here?

331
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,542
If I didn't,

332
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,545
you would look for Mr. Segawa

333
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,647
and kill him, wouldn't you?

334
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,952
Did you lie to me?

335
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,488
No, I really have the data.

336
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,022
Then bring it here now!

337
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,759
I will.

338
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,995
If you promise to leave…

339
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,464
the Glorious Ark.

340
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,334
What are you saying?

341
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,737
Atone

342
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,507
for your sins properly.

343
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,375
I will be

344
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,844
waiting for you.

345
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,846
You…

346
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,249
-Since when have you been…
-Miss Mifumi!

347
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:44,756
Why?

348
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,092
-You traitor!
-No!

349
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,729
Miss Mifumi wasn't the one
who called me here.

350
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,531
What?

351
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,467
That person told me that Miss Mifumi

352
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,703
wanted to rescue you, so she
pretended to be brainwashed

353
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,339
and infiltrated into the Glorious Ark.

354
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,811
You have been deceiving me
right from the beginning?

355
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,287
I just wanted you to come home,

356
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,322
Futaba.

357
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,993
Please come back.

358
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,999
Come back?

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,868
To where?

360
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,574
There is not a place I can return to.

361
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,810
I have ruined everything.

362
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,112
-Futaba…
-You, too.

363
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,482
You actually hate me, don't you?

364
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,816
-I don't hate…
-Liar!

365
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,986
It was all my fault.

366
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,524
I was responsible for both
Mom's and Dad's deaths.

367
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,928
-It was not your fault!
-Yes, it was.

368
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,731
If I hadn't asked Mom to go out
with me that day,

369
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,601
she wouldn't have had an accident.

370
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,903
If Mom were alive

371
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,239
-then Dad wouldn't have killed himself.
-No…

372
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,975
It was my fault.

373
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,647
<i>-It wasn't your fault!</i>
<i>-It was my fault!</i>

374
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,817
It is obvious!
Don't think that I'm stupid.

375
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,521
A person kills themself because they
don't want to do anything,

376
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,857
know anything,
see anything and hear anything.

377
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,293
That's why people kill themselves.

378
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,031
Futaba!

379
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,168
You suffered a lot, didn't you?

380
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,771
So many times…

381
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,542
You've tried so many times
to kill yourself.

382
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,445
-So please…
-If I could die…

383
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,948
I would have been dead ages ago.

384
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,586
I couldn't die,

385
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,489
but I couldn't live as well.

386
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,426
Then I met the Hierarch.

387
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,662
He hugged me tightly…

388
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,699
and thanked me for staying alive.

389
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,736
He said that he would give me
a purpose to live.

390
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,008
So I…

391
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,546
Give me the data.

392
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,517
I will continue to live for the Hierarch.

393
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,688
You're right.

394
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,457
It was your fault.

395
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,494
It was your fault that…

396
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,830
-your parents are dead.
-Shut up!

397
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:44,603
But this is what you think from the
bottom of your heart, isn't it?

398
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,606
Choco,

399
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,041
who you shot,

400
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,080
thinks that it was his fault that
his family died.

401
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,349
<i>On his birthday,</i>

402
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,452
<i>he threw a tantrum because he wanted</i>
<i>to go to an amusement park.</i>

403
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,921
<i>They had an accident on their way home.</i>

404
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,324
<i>His parents and younger brother died</i>

405
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,727
<i>and only he survived.</i>

406
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,733
Of course it wasn't his fault.

407
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,602
But no matter what other people tell him,

408
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,971
he still…

409
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,341
thinks from the bottom of his
heart that it was his fault.

410
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,877
But he lives

411
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,313
for himself.

412
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,415
Not for anyone else.

413
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,517
You can still live.

414
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,687
Even if you're carrying a very heavy
and painful burden on your shoulder,

415
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,123
you can still live for yourself.

416
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,294
As long as there is someone
who would laugh with you.

417
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,764
I don't know…

418
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,135
whether Choco sees us as friends
like that to him or not,

419
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,070
but he is

420
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,306
always smiling when he is with us.

421
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,309
You've got someone who does that, too!

422
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,211
And she is right here.

423
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,087
Futaba.

424
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,758
I don't want this.

425
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,628
I don't want to live my own life.

426
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,000
It is easy not to think about anything!

427
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,471
It's easier to live for someone who
would guide you in your life.

428
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,308
I know how you feel.

429
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,913
I used to be like that, too.

430
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,352
You… Why are you…

431
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,723
Your sister saved my life.

432
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:50,261
<i>She deceived the Hierarch's eyes</i>
<i>and saved my life.</i>

433
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,436
I called him here, too.

434
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,273
Is that so?

435
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,643
I thought…

436
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:11,316
maybe he could pull you out of there.

437
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,155
You mean he could get me out
of the Glorious Ark?

438
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,123
No,

439
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:23,294
I mean from the lonely cage
which you went into willingly.

440
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,767
The cage isn't even locked.
You're not confined in it.

441
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,904
You can go out whenever you want,

442
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,374
to the person who is waiting for you.

443
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,386
After I see this matter through
to its end,

444
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,989
my son and I will give ourselves up
to the police.

445
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,827
Let's go to the police together.

446
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,264
Let's atone for our sins together.

447
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,337
Futaba…

448
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,724
You…

449
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,093
have betrayed us, haven't you?

450
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,469
All traitors will be purified.

451
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,605
These are the teachings of the Hierarch.

452
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,838
Watch out!

453
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,607
Futaba!

454
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,056
You…

455
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,708
Futaba…

456
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,014
-I'll call an ambulance.
-No!

457
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,218
It will mean trouble.

458
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,120
You know that, don't you?

459
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,024
Futaba, no…

460
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,227
-No!
-I'm sorry, Mifumi.

461
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,065
This is the only thing

462
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,334
that I can do to protect you.

463
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:18,836
How…

464
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,873
did we end up like this?

465
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,610
When did I start doing wrong?

466
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,017
Have you always been with me, Mifumi?

467
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:37,922
Right there for me…

468
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,896
I want to start again.

469
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,898
Just one more time.

470
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,402
You can start again.

471
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,938
No, I can't.

472
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,943
I have killed too many people.

473
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,586
You…

474
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,562
Tell her…

475
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,965
someday,

476
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,901
tell her that…

477
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,438
you're grateful that she is alive.

478
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,654
Futaba…

479
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,923
Futaba…

480
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,696
Futaba! No!

481
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,566
No!

482
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,871
Don't leave me, Futaba!

483
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,244
-I couldn't do anything for them.
-I see.

484
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,749
She said that she would take care of
the rest, too.

485
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,488
I wonder if Miss Mifumi will be able
to leave

486
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,223
the Glorious Ark safely.

487
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,293
Don't worry.

488
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,963
Hikari's father will destroy them
with the data anyway.

489
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,269
I wonder if there is anything I can
do to help her.

490
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,807
Keebou.

491
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,845
Women and children steel themselves
for what they face when necessary.

492
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,216
It's rude to try to help someone who
has done that.

493
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,689
You have always trusted her, haven't you?

494
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,858
Despite what we told you.

495
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,467
Just keep trusting her.

496
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,773
TOILET

497
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:14,812
I can't get it out!

498
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,349
Let me take a break!

499
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,918
Don't be silly! Of course you can't!
Don't stop until you get it out!

500
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,120
Don't say it like
"Don't be defeated until you win!"

501
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:26,190
Guys, I can't do it when you're just
a door away from me.

502
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,126
Shut up, Data Boy!

503
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,461
If you can't get it out in ten minutes,

504
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,830
I will sentence you to the
enema punishment.

505
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,399
-Please, don't do that!
-I'll execute it using my hands.

506
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,934
Don't do that, please spare me that!

507
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,203
Why don't we just hand Choco
himself to Mr. Goto?

508
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,805
How can you do that to me?

509
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,106
Just wait!

510
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,741
That's because you did something stupid.

511
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,185
I'm sorry.

512
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,116
Sorry about the data.

513
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,187
-But before the deadline, I'll…
-It's not necessary.

514
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,989
We will get it soon.

515
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,691
What the heck?

516
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,460
-You have betrayed us?
-Sendagi!

517
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,681
That will do it.

518
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,783
Now…

519
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,820
Your son's life will be saved.

520
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,236
How we got it was a bit gross,

521
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,271
but we have disinfected it properly.

522
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,707
Thank you.

523
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:24,909
Really.

524
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,444
Thank you.

525
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,748
-May I ask you something?
-Yes?

526
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,585
What is stored in it?

527
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,723
It is some news that will cause
chaos in Japan

528
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,825
and all over the world in a week.

529
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,895
That's what stored inside.

530
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,033
The day has finally come.

531
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,040
-You can look forward to it.
-Okay.

532
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,512
Hikari,

533
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,114
see you again.

534
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,653
We will. I'm sure that we'll meet again.

535
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:14,091
Please tell Choco and Ponjara
to get well soon.

536
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:18,462
-Sure.
-I think Choco will cry.

537
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,431
What? Choco cries?

538
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,101
I know Ponjara will bawl his eyes
out, but Choco?

539
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,805
His nose would keep running when he
cried, and he would cry overnight.

540
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,908
-His eyes would swell so much.
-Seriously?

541
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,146
Thank you, Hikari.

542
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,681
Why?

543
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,382
If I had not met you,

544
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,018
I would never have been friends
again with them.

545
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,186
Yeah, same here.

546
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,289
We would have kept feeling gloomy.

547
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,027
Thank you, Hikari.

548
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,931
Oh, right.

549
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,468
Please keep this.

550
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,837
-Yes?
-As a token.

551
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,305
Oh… Thanks.

552
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,577
Thank you so much.

553
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:11,482
You guys really are the hope
of this country.

554
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,551
You're exaggerating.

555
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,386
Keebou…

556
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,458
Forget it.

557
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,962
Take care, Hikari.

558
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,082
Guys, thank you.

559
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:47,952
Thank you.

560
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,923
We're reluctant to leave,
but we have to go.

561
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:03,934
Hikari!

562
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,072
Take care!

563
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,826
Keebou…

564
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,763
I love you.

565
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,898
I love you!

566
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,134
I love you, Keebou.

567
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,911
See you, Hikari.

568
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,173
Welcome home.

569
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,076
I'm home.

570
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,614
I'm home.

571
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,590
-Welcome home, Pichan.
-I'm home.

572
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,991
I want to buy something.

573
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,093
Have a seat.

574
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,896
I thought you said you had bought enough?

575
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,632
I want to buy it! I want it! This one.

576
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:49,867
SATOJIMA

577
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,268
I'm home.

578
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,673
Of course she is gone.

579
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,519
Toru?

580
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,621
Why?

581
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:12,923
Welcome home!

582
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,570
MIKI TIRES

583
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,306
I'm home.

584
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,443
Welcome home.

585
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,348
Enema?

586
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:42,152
-It's not funny.
-It is very funny.

587
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,023
-Mr. Tokui?
-Yes?

588
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:47,992
Hello.

589
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,898
You've never told me!

590
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,467
It's not what you think, idiot!

591
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,135
It isn't?

592
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,137
I didn't mean that.

593
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,642
How did you utter that sound?

594
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,909
-Shut up!
-"I didn't mean that…"

595
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:20,724
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.
I LOVE YOU, KEEBOU.

596
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,000
-Okay, I'll think about it.
-Thank you!

597
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,812
Thanks very much.

598
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,056
<i>Today, before dawn,</i>
<i>a fire broke out in a hotel</i>

599
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,991
<i>at the airport in Narita City,</i>
<i>Chiba Prefecture.</i>

600
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,726
<i>In the room where it started</i>

601
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,496
<i>bodies believed to be the two</i>
<i>occupants were found.</i>

602
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:04,068
<i>The victims of this fire seemed to</i>
<i>be 44-year-old Yukio Goto</i>

603
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:07,871
<i>and his daughter, 10-year-old Hikari Goto.</i>

604
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,740
<i>According to the police and the</i>
<i>fire service,</i>

605
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,476
<i>the fire burnt the room,</i>
<i>where the source of the fire was,</i>

606
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,678
<i>and was put out after about an hour,</i>

607
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,181
-Impossible…
<i>-but the bodies of the Gotos,</i>

608
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,484
<i>who stayed in the room, where the</i>
<i>origin of the fire was, were found.</i>

609
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,654
I don't believe this…
You have to be kidding…

610
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,494
-Did I lose?
-I didn't think it would be like this.

611
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,664
<i>Thank you for saving me.</i>
<i>I love you, Keebou.</i>

612
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,067
<i>Please go back to you normal life.</i>
