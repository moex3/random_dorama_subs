00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,371
<i>Today, before dawn,</i>
<i>a fire broke out in a hotel</i>

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,374
<i>Narita City Airport, Chiba Prefecture.</i>

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,745
<i>The victims of the fire</i>
<i>seem to be 44-year-old Yukio Goto</i>

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:12,812
<i>and his daughter,</i>

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>ten-year-old Hikari Goto.</i>

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>The police are working to determine</i>
<i>the cause of the fire.</i>

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,120
No way…

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,389
This isn't true…

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,958
You have to be kidding!

10
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,510
<i>According to the fire service,</i>

11
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,645
<i>the cause of the fire was smoking in bed.</i>

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:51,317
<i>Sadly, the fire sprinkler in the Gotos'</i>
<i>room was the only one that didn't work.</i>

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,553
METROPOLITAN POLICE SHINAGAWA
MINAMI POLICE STATION

14
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,263
Mr. Oshima.

15
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,833
Please let us see Hikari.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,537
The state of the body
is pretty horrible, are you sure?

17
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,608
I want to see her.

18
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,510
I want to see Hikari.

19
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,730
Hikari…

20
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,576
Are you sure that this is Hikari?

21
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,313
We're hurrying to run a DNA test,

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,014
but the dental record matched hers.

23
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,552
I think the fire was not related to
the series of incidents.

24
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,856
Also, the flight they were supposed
to take yesterday

25
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,924
was canceled because of an engine failure,

26
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,760
so they had to stay in that room…

27
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,796
These incidents are also just
extremely coincidental.

28
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,365
It is difficult to tamper with the
fire sprinkler in advance,

29
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,637
and the SD card was inserted
into the laptop,

30
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,340
though it was so badly damaged that
it was impossible to analyze.

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,309
But it probably stored the data.

32
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,748
-Where is Paul?
-Yes?

33
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,917
<i>He's the dog that Hikari has with her.</i>

34
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,587
I haven't been told about that.
I'll check that as soon as I can.

35
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,989
Thank you.

36
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,999
Most of their belongings were burned,

37
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,234
but this was left in the bathroom.

38
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,222
Saeki, Tokui.

39
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,861
I'm very sorry.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,898
I know apologizing isn't enough to
ask for your forgiveness…

41
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:19,933
I…

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,435
I thought you were as stupid
as the old people

43
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,703
who'd fall for the "it's me" scams.

44
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,539
Nobody falls for them.

45
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,043
But that's what parents are.

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,179
The stupid and unforgivable ones are

47
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,114
the people who used a parent's love
to deceive them.

48
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,791
Sorry for making you do something
so difficult. Thank you.

49
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,427
It's okay. I'll call you when
I get hold of any information.

50
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,329
But more importantly,

51
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,265
is Segawa okay?

52
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,601
He is not okay.

53
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,768
Of course,

54
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,738
he's not the only one. None of us is okay.

55
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,045
Mr. Oshima, he is a white Poodle.

56
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,584
Hikari's dog. There is a large bell
attached to his collar.

57
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,519
Okay.

58
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,389
-Thanks very much.
-Okay.

59
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,396
Darn!

60
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,967
I hate how this ended!

61
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,772
Hikari…

62
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,243
was smiling in the airport.

63
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,448
We had won…

64
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,319
That was what we thought.

65
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,392
Toru, stay at my place today.

66
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,263
Keebou, too.

67
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,437
Stay with Miki, Keebou.

68
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,374
No, I'll go home.

69
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,610
Just stay at Miki's place.

70
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,912
Or you can stay with me.

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,517
You can stay at mine, too.

72
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,156
I'll go home.

73
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,127
Maybe Hikari will come back.

74
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,796
Keebou!

75
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,832
Pull yourself together! Don't be stupid.

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,935
Of course she won't come back.

77
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,438
Hikari is dead.

78
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,040
I don't believe this.

79
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,410
This isn't about whether you
believe it or not.

80
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,679
This is the facts, Keebou!

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,383
-You have seen Hikari's…
-That wasn't Hikari!

82
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,220
-You…
-Don't say that, Keebou!

83
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,292
You would have hurt Hikari's feelings!

84
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,527
Hikari was…

85
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,665
our Hikari, wasn't she?

86
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,305
Keebou.

87
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,978
People die,

88
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,280
you know…

89
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,755
-Keebou!
-Let him go.

90
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,922
But…

91
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,092
At a time like this there is no use
saying anything.

92
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,832
Okay… I'll go to work now.

93
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,469
-Choco.
-Hm?

94
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,872
Is Paul a Poodle?

95
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,341
-No?
-Well…

96
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,843
-I don't know much about dogs.
-Same here.

97
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,780
But I can tell the difference
between black and white.

98
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,625
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.
I LOVE YOU, KEEBOU.

99
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,904
<i>Thank you for helping me.</i>

100
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,972
<i>I love you, Keebou!</i>

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,184
Hikari…

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,921
Hikari!

103
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,858
Hikari!

104
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,748
Mr. Segawa.

105
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm shocked to learn about…

106
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,229
what happened to Hikari.

107
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,099
It didn't occur to me that
this would happen.

108
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,540
Miss Mifumi…

109
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,776
What about the Glorious Ark?

110
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,480
Please don't worry about that.

111
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,983
Futaba and the other two people
had betrayed them,

112
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,185
so I said I had purified them.

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,989
-What are you going to…
-I will…

114
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,291
live my own life.

115
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,060
So please…

116
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,997
return to your own life, too.

117
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,407
I wonder…

118
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,943
what my life really is about.

119
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,746
I remember you once said

120
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,117
that when you don't want to do anything,

121
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,654
see anything and hear anything,

122
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,391
that's when you want to kill yourself.

123
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,062
I know this now.

124
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,865
What that means.

125
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,634
Mr. Segawa…

126
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:34,140
We had protected her.

127
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,977
From gangsters,

128
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,680
a killer,

129
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,584
and even the police.

130
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,689
Why did a fire kill her?

131
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,065
Was I…

132
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,200
defeated?

133
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,082
Keebou isn't answering the phone?

134
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,853
<i>-The number you've dialed has…</i>
-He ignored it yesterday too.

135
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,094
Oh, I ordered soba noodles in soup, ma'am.

136
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,230
The tempura is on the house.
You look quite depressed.

137
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,033
Thank you.

138
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,605
<i>Of course, I have heard about it as well.</i>

139
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,208
<i>The groundless slander and defamation</i>

140
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,577
<i>against the Glorious Ark.</i>

141
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,815
<i>Real righteousness has always</i>
<i>been persecuted throughout history,</i>

142
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,751
<i>-but eventually…</i>
-That pig…

143
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,387
<i>…real righteousness will change the world.</i>

144
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,062
<i>Again!</i>

145
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,273
<i>-One more time!</i>
-Keebou!

146
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,613
Empty yourselves!

147
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,019
Hey.

148
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,458
You're the guy who was with…

149
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,560
What are you doing here?

150
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,898
I brought him here.

151
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,101
He has lost everything.

152
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,437
Then he realized

153
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,307
how foolish and weak he had been.

154
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,012
Please let me join you!

155
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,880
I have left nothing for myself.

156
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,285
I'm prepared to offer everything
to the Glorious Ark.

157
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,454
Regardless of their past

158
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,825
we accept everybody who seeks
salvation without question.

159
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,463
This is the spirit
of "Everything's all right", isn't it?

160
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,933
-But that's…
-She is right.

161
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,801
Hierarch…

162
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,473
Segawa.

163
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,311
If someone like you
would become one of us,

164
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,781
it would be very encouraging to us.

165
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,884
But still,

166
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,887
we have too much history.

167
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,024
If you say that you're not
our enemy anymore…

168
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:45,064
then can you provide us with some proof?

169
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,467
What should I do?

170
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,475
-There's no doubt about it.
-It's Keebou.

171
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,877
That's Keebou.

172
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,545
What is that idiot doing?

173
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,180
Has Keebou ever worn glasses?

174
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,883
I think it was the best disguise
that the idiot could come up with.

175
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,084
He didn't answer.

176
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,352
-Still no signal?
-No.

177
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,454
He wasn't at his home yesterday, too,

178
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,456
when I dropped by on my way home
after delivering the clothes.

179
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,293
Keebou hasn't seriously joined
the group, has he?

180
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,930
-No, of course that's impossible…
-It's hard to say.

181
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,832
You can never be certain about
what Keebou thinks.

182
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,502
-What?
-He is a very straightforward person.

183
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,905
Depending on where the arrow
is pointing to,

184
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,473
he would go straight to do something
ridiculous, too.

185
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,177
He is too consumed with grief.

186
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,047
It's either that, or he seriously
believes that Hikari is alive

187
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,816
and has charged into the enemy
to look for her.

188
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,118
-That's also possible.
-Yes, it is.

189
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,221
But either way he will get caught.

190
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,490
All the people there know who he is,

191
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,725
and it wasn't really a disguise.

192
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,798
-I really can't leave him alone!
-Let's go and see how he's doing.

193
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,634
Keebou really does make
everyone worry about him.

194
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,902
Don't come with us, Choco.

195
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,472
-Why?
-You still can't move freely,

196
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,275
and you made the hospital discharge
you to come here, didn't you?

197
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,546
-Okay.
-Yeah.

198
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,914
You're awfully obedient.

199
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,285
Takuya is having his operation
today, and it's already started.

200
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,055
-Is Takuya, Mr. Oshima's…
-Yeah.

201
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,624
-I'll go and visit him.
-Okay.

202
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,227
You should have a rest too,

203
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,728
or you'll get stupider.

204
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,930
-I'm okay now…
-I'll leave Keebou to you.

205
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,098
-Sure.
-Yeah.

206
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,200
-Choco.
-Yes?

207
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,169
Don't act recklessly.

208
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,837
What?

209
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,974
It's pretty important to us.

210
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,876
What is important?

211
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,944
Your life.

212
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,984
You say the most embarrassing
things, Miki.

213
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,730
No one has come to tell us
to settle old scores.

214
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,331
I told you, no one will.

215
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,401
-Maybe they are frightened.
-Listen to me!

216
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,471
And get away from me.
There is not enough oxygen.

217
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,140
Why are you dressed like that?

218
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,014
Listen, it was the president who
betrayed the gangs in Japan

219
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,582
and curried favor with Rainman.

220
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,185
It's the president who has to put on
a last spurt.

221
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,390
-We don't have to hide.
-Yes, Boss…

222
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,860
You're dismissed after this is settled.

223
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,628
Yes, Boss…

224
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,565
Hang on…

225
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,802
Boss, we're dismissed?

226
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,140
-Think about what you're going to do.
-But Boss…

227
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,186
Ouch! What the heck is this?

228
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,255
That barricade is pointless!

229
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,325
-Anyway, Boss, this is bad news!
-You're so noisy! What is it?

230
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,263
THE PRESIDENT OF THE GANGSTER
ORGANIZATION SENDAGI IS SHOT DEAD

231
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,498
IT HAS CAUSED A STIR AMONG THE EXECUTIVES…

232
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,389
-Bodyguard?
-Yes.

233
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,825
A bodyguard for someone of high rank who

234
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,994
even I don't get to meet.

235
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,597
There is a vacancy.

236
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,934
He died to protect the person.

237
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,639
Our role in the ideal country is the
secret police, and among us,

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,477
the bodyguard is one of the most
important job.

239
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,615
Offering your body and making it
useful for the greater purpose.

240
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,718
There is nothing more wonderful
than this, is there?

241
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,687
No, sir.

242
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,457
I'm solely responsible for
picking the candidates.

243
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,660
I sincerely hope that…

244
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,330
you'll take the test, too.

245
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:17,002
-Test?
-It is not difficult at all.

246
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,505
Just fight…

247
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,174
and the person who defeats
everyone else will pass.

248
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,417
Hold on… Melos.

249
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,155
I'm surprised to find no security guards.

250
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,226
Well, it is a normal religious body
in public.

251
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,062
Despite being a group of assassins.

252
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,631
Will we be killed if we're found?

253
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,568
The incident was settled for the
time being, so it should be okay.

254
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,103
There is no use thinking about it.

255
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,405
An idiot has already charged in there.

256
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,940
Toru, lend me your shoes.

257
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,241
-Why?
-Just do it.

258
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,175
Anyway, Pon,

259
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,311
-are you really sure about this?
-What?

260
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,313
If your wound opens up and your
brain shoots out,

261
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,380
I'll be really grossed out.

262
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,050
Don't get grossed out!
You have to help me.

263
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,986
Hey, Miki!

264
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,157
Gosh, Miki!

265
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,159
What are you doing?

266
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,528
What is this, Miki? Stress?
Or are you just naughty?

267
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,830
Oh, look…

268
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:57,136
It's fine. If Keebou is caught they
will take us to where he is.

269
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,871
It takes too much trouble to look for him!

270
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,640
He is so wild…

271
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,187
We have caught Segawa's friends.

272
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,673
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

273
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,509
-You're here!
-Sorry, I'm late.

274
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,012
It's okay. He'll be happy.

275
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,648
He kept talking about you.

276
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,386
Oh, the white poodle with a bell
attached to its collar.

277
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,622
When they checked in at the hotel,

278
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,059
a staff member saw Hikari holding it
in her arms. But now…

279
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,062
Mr. Oshima.

280
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,933
You're surprisingly careless
at the final stage.

281
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,401
Why?

282
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,672
I didn't think you'd fall for
such a stupid lie.

283
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,146
Hikari is actually alive, isn't she?

284
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,451
Did you kill the people whose bodies
were used as substitutes?

285
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,987
No.

286
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,156
Well, I guess the Glorious Ark

287
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,592
can get as many dead bodies as they want.

288
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,895
They got you involved in the end,
didn't they?

289
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,971
Are you out of your mind?

290
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,974
-If you fire here, people will…
-It will be hushed up.

291
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,943
There are people behind me who are
powerful enough to do that.

292
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,948
This is your answer, right?

293
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,853
Hikari is alive, isn't she?

294
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,893
Brilliant. He is good.

295
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,700
Brilliant. That was brilliant,
Kiichi Segawa.

296
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,037
You are the strongest.

297
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,973
But…

298
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,541
Frankly, I…

299
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,614
I still can't wipe out the fact that
you were once our enemy.

300
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,185
I'm not going to blame you
for your past, but…

301
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,388
I need some solid proof,

302
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,524
that will prove your loyalty

303
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:37,262
to not only me,
but also the people of high rank.

304
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,631
What should I do?

305
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,974
Walk quickly!

306
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,978
-Keebou!
-Keebou! Why?

307
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,115
-Keebou!
-It's gone exactly as Miki planned.

308
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,917
Choose one

309
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,219
among these people.

310
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,356
You will purify him, Segawa.

311
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,959
Choose one…

312
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,497
and kill him here now.

313
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,736
That will be your final test.

314
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,239
Okay.

315
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,100
Shoot me.

316
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,603
They won't keep quiet if you kill me.

317
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,074
Then you can't do anything, and no
powerful people can hush it up.

318
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,679
You guys are so cool.

319
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,183
Don't look at me with eyes like that.

320
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,120
Your eyes are so pure and honest.

321
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,322
You don't know, do you?

322
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,325
My reflection looks so sly and dirty

323
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,461
in your open and honest eyes.

324
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,333
When I see it, I'm so embarrassed
that I want to die!

325
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,002
It feels awful when your eyes can't
reflect others in them!

326
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,804
It's not too late to do that.

327
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,140
You were a good policeman once.

328
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,343
-You can still go back for Takuya.
-No, I can't go back!

329
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,511
Why?

330
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:40,552
I shot the Sendagi Group's president dead.

331
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,956
In exchange for Takuya's operation.

332
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,930
I can't go back.

333
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,601
You were the one who killed the old man?

334
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,883
Hey…

335
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,552
What are you thinking, Keebou?

336
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,032
Is he serious?

337
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,534
Could Keebou be brainwashed for real?

338
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,545
What's wrong with you?

339
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,218
Wake up, Keebou!

340
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,398
-You're kidding…
-Miki!

341
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,458
I see.

342
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,760
Your eyes are dull.

343
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,835
There is a suicide note
in my breast pocket.

344
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:38,970
Please…

345
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,673
Tell Takuya for me…

346
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,542
that I love him with all of my heart.

347
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,210
Don't say anything sentimental.

348
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,713
You…

349
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,251
If Takuya knows his father killed
someone and then himself for him…

350
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,720
Are you trying to give him
such a heavy cross to bear?

351
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,092
If you love him, lie to him.

352
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,729
Never let him think
that you killed someone for him.

353
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,365
You'll say that you killed
Sendagi's president for justice.

354
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,801
Stick with your lie with all your might

355
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,604
until you die.

356
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,495
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

357
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,802
The operation went well.

358
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,914
Takuya.

359
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,286
Takuya.

360
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,529
Remember.

361
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,966
Stick to the lie.

362
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,740
-Miki!
-Miki…

363
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,665
He is dead.

364
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,302
Brilliant…

365
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,771
Wait.

366
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,085
Congratulations.

367
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,986
You've passed,

368
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,255
Kiichi Segawa.

369
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,699
No way!

370
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,801
Miki is…

371
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,470
dead.

372
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,405
Okay. I'll go now.

373
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,608
Come to my room.

374
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,019
Keebou! You son of a gun!

375
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,661
Keebou! Choco just texted me!

376
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,929
Hikari is alive!

377
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,631
Keebou!

378
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,600
Hikari is alive!

379
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,969
Keebou!

380
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,705
You idiot! Idiot!

381
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,342
-Shut up!
-Keebou!

382
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,344
Keebou!

383
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:49,921
Hikari…

384
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,327
It is successfully unlocked

385
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,863
and we have moved the data here.

386
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,032
Nobody has…

387
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,701
seen the content, right?

388
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,137
No one in our science team

389
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,606
would transgress God's will.

390
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,476
You can go now.

391
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,801
<i>-Dad!</i>
<i>-No!</i>

392
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,469
<i>-Dad!</i>
<i>-No!</i>

393
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,272
<i>-Dad!</i>
<i>-Please.</i>

394
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,841
<i>Please spare her!</i>

395
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,346
<i>Dad! No!</i>

396
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,081
<i>Dad…</i>

397
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,221
<i>Dad!</i>

398
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,790
This is Segawa.

399
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm…

400
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,596
I'm coming.

401
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,834
You've saved my life. Thanks.

402
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,239
I received a call,
from Mad Dog number one.

403
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,374
-Miki called you?
-Yeah.

404
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
He told me that you were trying to
do something

405
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,745
and asked me to check on you.

406
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,582
Since when have you become so close?

407
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,185
We're not close.

408
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,087
I owe him a favor.

409
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,265
-My car is here, fancy a ride?
-No, thanks.

410
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,035
And I'm sorry, but will you do me a favor?

411
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,873
Chancellor, it's a big job that has
to be done by someone like you.

412
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,277
What is it?

413
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:53,878
Shoot.

414
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,392
What's the matter?

415
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,301
You know…

416
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,971
I have believed for
a very long time that I was

417
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,840
God's messenger.

418
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,711
People love me for some reason.

419
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,213
Since my childhood.

420
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:35,486
Everybody admires and looks up to me.

421
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,257
I don't know why.

422
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,694
I thought that…

423
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,864
it was because I was blessed by God.

424
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,503
But…

425
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,440
Before I knew it

426
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,409
I've become something far from
God's blessing,

427
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,145
and I might have…

428
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,515
become the devil's instrument.

429
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,787
I don't know much about god and devil,

430
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,123
but…

431
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,994
if everybody loved you when you were
a child, then…

432
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,029
Yes?

433
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,531
I think…

434
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,935
you must have been a very nice person.

435
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,211
We will now perform
the purification process.

436
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,021
Traitor!

437
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,995
-Miki!
-I thought you were dead!

438
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:51,963
Are you a zombie?

439
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,132
Idiot, that feeble kick can't kill me.

440
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,135
-I'm so glad that you're alive!
-Okay…

441
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,236
Let's go!

442
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,878
You'll get out of here with us.

443
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,152
Paul…

444
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,725
Aww, you're so darn cute! Hey!

445
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:24,796
Good lord!

446
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,732
Keebou went without telling us!
He's treating us like strangers!

447
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,933
Exactly.

448
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,836
That idiot hasn't grown up a bit
in ten years.

449
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,237
WHO ARE YOU

450
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,841
I think he is trying to do all the
dirty work himself.

451
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,311
So that you won't get involved.

452
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,315
He also lied to me at the beginning

453
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,151
and pretended to have really joined
the group.

454
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,787
But he didn't have to tell me,
because I knew soon enough,

455
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,957
what Mr. Segawa's real intention is.

456
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,159
-Why?
-It was his eyes, right?

457
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,395
-Eyes?
-Yes, his eyes.

458
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,766
<i>I could tell it when I saw his eyes.</i>

459
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,037
<i>Mr. Segawa believes in something</i>

460
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,106
<i>and his heart is honest.</i>

461
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,043
They are waiting.

462
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,450
<i>His eyes? They look totally crazy.</i>

463
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,786
Keebou made the right decision
to pick Miki.

464
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,089
So I pretended to be defeated
because I knew you'd do something.

465
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,327
-Yes.
-But the old man checked Miki's pulse,

466
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,528
then why couldn't he tell that
he faked his death?

467
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,465
I pressed a point which makes
the pulse undetectable.

468
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,867
Oh, that's why!

469
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,003
-It hurt like hell.
-I'm impressed by the nurse.

470
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,005
Here he is.

471
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,208
The other guy who wants to
do all the dirty work.

472
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,279
Wow, this brings back memories!

473
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,481
It's still here!

474
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,283
Wow…

475
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,686
Oh? Where is Keebou?

476
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,194
Where is it?

477
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,205
Thank you. Please leave the room.

478
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,452
Rainman…

479
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,254
That's the name.

480
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,224
But this is not the truth.

481
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,293
What?

482
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,333
I will now…

483
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,136
take you to where Rainman is.

484
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,634
He will fill the vacancy.

485
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,870
He will join the bodyguards. Also…

486
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,941
We have successfully retrieved it.

487
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,710
What would you do with it?

488
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,346
Is that…

489
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,648
the ritual's…

490
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:31,749
Yes.

491
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,354
Well, it is not very important now.

492
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,256
You're right.

493
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,592
Because everything is ready.

494
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,496
Then I will handle this.

495
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,331
Sure.

496
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,673
Maybe she is your mom?

497
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,444
Hikari's…

498
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,447
You're Hikari's mom, aren't you?

499
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,784
You're alive! You're Rainman!

500
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,787
You can't talk to her like that!
That is rude!

501
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:10,855
Hikari…

502
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,158
-Where is Hikari?
-Don't look directly at her!

503
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,460
Please tell me!

504
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,095
Hikari is alive, right?

505
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,305
Before the ceremony is held,

506
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,941
we cannot let her die.

507
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,444
-Ceremony?
-So…

508
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,381
I am certain that she has not been killed.

509
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,050
What do you mean?

510
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,855
I have to talk to her!

511
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,391
He is going to such
a dangerous place alone?

512
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,592
WHO ARE YOU

513
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,561
Isn't it too risky for Keebou?

514
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,196
But we don't know where it is.

515
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,131
No matter how much we want to
go to rescue him.

516
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:58,569
Well, we have to trust Keebou, then.

517
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,940
-Rod.
-Rod, huh?

518
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,142
-It's rod.
-Yeah, rod.

519
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,210
Rod.

520
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,745
What rod?

521
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,014
Mr. Akagi,

522
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,982
I'm sorry, but I have no time!

523
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,685
I will use a rod.

524
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,054
You're in Rainman's presence.
Don't say anything unnecessary!

525
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,705
The "bou" in Keebou's name
doesn't mean "boy"?

526
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,274
Idiot, it means rod, as in what a
roaming dog may find in the proverb.

527
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,711
But… Right, look! It's written here!

528
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,713
That's the word

529
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,882
he wrote when he
made Mr. Akagi his promise,

530
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,017
so that he wouldn't forget it.

531
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,453
He will be too dangerous
if he has a rod in his hand.

532
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,423
So Keebou had sealed off his rod.

533
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,726
His nickname, Keebou, actually means
"dangerous rod".

534
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,362
What? Can I tweet about it?

535
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,365
Where is Hikari?

536
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,701
Tell me!

537
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,405
He won't tell you.

538
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,708
Even if you kill him.

539
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,514
Please tell me! Hikari…

540
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,536
There is not much light…

541
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:40,504
that can reach here.

542
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,561
You will regret it soon enough.

543
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,863
The self-absorbed and childish

544
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,099
sense of justice
that you're now addicted to.

545
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,876
Ryugasaki.

546
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,946
I wonder which one is stronger.

547
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,816
The rain, or the sun?

548
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,021
Flood and drought…

549
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,126
Which will make people suffer more

550
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,396
when they die in it?

551
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,502
We will show you

552
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,471
the answers to your questions very soon.

553
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,994
Hikari.

554
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,631
I'm very sorry that

555
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,800
this has happened to you.

556
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,170
I'm sorry.

557
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,173
I'm sorry.

558
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:24,875
Hikari.

559
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,813
Dad.

560
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,251
You can't cry now.

561
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,455
Because your heart will admit defeat.

562
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,428
You have to get up your courage.

563
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,199
As long as you don't admit defeat,

564
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,903
then you're just on your way
to claim your victory.

565
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,907
Don't be give up until you win.

566
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,643
Kiichi told you that?

567
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,280
Don't worry.

568
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:08,085
Because Keebou will surely come
to get us out of here.

569
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,486
Come here!

570
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,754
<i>I know he is capable,</i>

571
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,823
<i>but he won't find this place.</i>

572
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,025
He will come for us.

573
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,861
I'm sure Keebou will.

574
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:19,830
<i>Very soon.</i>

575
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,032
<i>He will come very soon.</i>

576
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,635
Hikari…

577
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,171
Listen.

578
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,742
Can you hear footsteps?

579
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,618
I can hear them.

580
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,623
<i>Keebou will come for us.</i>

581
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,292
<i>He will.</i>

582
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,330
He'll call my name.

583
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,334
Hikari!

584
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,707
Hikari!

585
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,509
Hikari!

586
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,750
You see? Dad.

587
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,126
Keebou!

588
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,726
Keebou…

589
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,730
I knew you would come to rescue us.

590
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,734
I knew you were alive.

591
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,057
FINAL EPISODE

592
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,392
THE FINAL SHOWDOWN WITH RAINMAN

593
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,060
<i>Bye, Keebou.</i>

594
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,062
FAREWELL, WILD HEROES
