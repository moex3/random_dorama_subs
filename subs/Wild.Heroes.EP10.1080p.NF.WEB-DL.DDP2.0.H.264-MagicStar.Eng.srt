1
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,578
Hikari!

2
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,660
Go after him!

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,402
<i>I will draw their attention to me.</i>

4
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,506
Take Hikari with you
and run away while I do that.

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,810
-Dad, no!
-Don't worry, I won't be killed…

6
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:45,745
before the ceremony.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,616
What is the ceremony about?

8
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,720
Look at the content of the data,
then you'll know everything.

9
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,559
But please don't ever let Hikari see it.

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,462
Okay.

11
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,899
One more day. Just protect her
for one more day.

12
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,534
Please don't let her fall into
their hands.

13
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,170
One more day…

14
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,604
Dad…

15
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:13,840
Hikari.

16
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,511
I'm sorry, it's your birthday
tomorrow, but…

17
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,590
Keebou and Hikari are late.

18
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,164
WHO ARE YOU

19
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,133
-Guys!
-Hikari.

20
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,369
-Hikari…
-Hikari!

21
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,271
-Are you okay? Good.
-Yeah.

22
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,240
Keebou.

23
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,826
They got both the data and the girl.
What is your excuse, Ryugasaki?

24
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,429
If the ritual is brought to light, we…

25
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,697
We can deal with it.

26
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,734
We will get the power to do that
soon enough.

27
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,271
For a long time our ancestors have been

28
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,307
supporting this country
and running the government

29
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,976
in the background.

30
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,678
And finally…

31
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,548
the back and front will change places.

32
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,619
The seven of us will be the
generation to accomplish this.

33
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,555
But if tomorrow's ritual fails…

34
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,390
The ritual will be carried out.

35
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,763
The new world that is designed to be

36
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,266
subject to order,
and regulation will begin.

37
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,769
The seven of us…

38
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,439
<i>and the new Rainman will start this world.</i>

39
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,346
Here it goes.

40
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,551
I'll play the videos first.

41
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,719
NAME

42
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,793
YOKO AMEMIYA. MAY 19, 1984

43
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,495
Yoko?

44
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>No! Don't do this!</i>

45
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,568
What is this?

46
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>No!</i>

47
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,838
<i>Dad!</i>

48
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,945
What the heck is this?

49
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,380
It's not a movie, is it?

50
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,650
I think this girl…

51
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,954
is Hikari's mom.

52
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,223
Hikari's mom?

53
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,292
She died in an accident, didn't she?

54
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,561
No, she is alive.

55
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,731
Hikari's mom is now…

56
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,234
SOYOKO AMEMIYA. OCTOBER 21, 1957

57
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,773
<i>No… Don't do this!</i>

58
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,343
<i>Dad!</i>

59
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,145
<i>Dad!</i>

60
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,181
<i>Don't make her do this!</i>

61
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,550
<i>Please, don't make my daughter do this!</i>

62
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,451
The ritual.

63
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,854
<i>Dad!</i>

64
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:17,857
<i>This is…</i>

65
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,361
<i>the whole process of the succession</i>
<i>ritual that will be carried out.</i>

66
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,329
<i>This ritual is…</i>

67
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,101
Ritual…

68
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,204
I have met them.

69
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,706
Are they Rainman?

70
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,809
No, they aren't.

71
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,045
<i>Rainman is…</i>

72
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>Hikari's mom.</i>

73
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,421
Why are you doing something so horrible?

74
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,857
It's the rite of passage.

75
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,628
So that she'll be aware of her fate
of having to live in the dark

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,930
and accept it.

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,833
Where there is light,

78
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,136
there is shadow.

79
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,339
Light can't be born without shadow.

80
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,678
The sun warms everything,

81
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,280
but if it doesn't rain,

82
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,082
the sunlight

83
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,118
will burn everything.

84
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,291
Is Rainman the shadow and the rain?

85
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,764
It's the seven people who make
the sky rain.

86
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,502
What I have is the ground of history only.

87
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,338
I'm nothing more than a symbol.

88
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,573
So…

89
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,243
A part of me thought

90
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,180
that maybe I could totally escape from it.

91
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,684
I left my home,

92
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,288
encountered you,

93
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,558
then I was blessed with Hikari.

94
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,893
I thought…

95
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:06,799
maybe I could live my whole life
as Yoko Goto.

96
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,835
However…

97
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,171
It wasn't possible.

98
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,877
The day my mother died,

99
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,215
they feigned an accident
and brought me here.

100
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,685
So that I would…

101
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,622
become the next Rainman.

102
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,925
Rainman is a post passed down on the
maternal side of the family,

103
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,996
from mother to daughter, and has
existed for several centuries.

104
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,266
On the daughter's 11th birthday,

105
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,236
she would kill her father herself
and perform the rite of passage

106
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,004
and get the title…

107
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,408
Kill her father?

108
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,546
The current Rainman is Hikari's mom,
right?

109
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,515
That means…

110
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,852
<i>Hikari will be the next Rainman.</i>

111
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,458
Hikari's 11th birthday is…

112
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,428
It's tomorrow.

113
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,898
Is that why Mr. Goto asked us

114
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,368
to protect Hikari for one more day?

115
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,838
What on earth is Rainman after all?

116
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,407
I don't really know, too, but…

117
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,278
There is one thing that I'm certain about…

118
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,282
I don't care what this ritual is about,

119
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,251
but I will never

120
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,421
let Hikari do something so insane.

121
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,858
Okay. We'll protect her.

122
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,496
I will not let her do something as
cruel as killing her own father.

123
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,732
Please.

124
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,904
Help Hikari.

125
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,276
She will never

126
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,712
be able to escape from this.

127
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,714
This is her destiny.

128
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,286
<i>Because she was born as my daughter.</i>

129
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,092
There you go.

130
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,431
Thank you.

131
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,838
Let's go to another place.
It's difficult to fight here.

132
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,939
We can't do anything if they besiege us.

133
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,442
Our old hangout in the union will do.

134
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,777
Good idea. The structure there
is complicated.

135
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,580
Tenten used to get lost inside, after all.

136
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,618
-Is the place still there?
-Yeah, Chancellor told me so.

137
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,887
He told us to move there
when this place was found.

138
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,489
He has suddenly become nice, hasn't he?

139
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,593
What are you saying, Melos?
He has always been nice.

140
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,165
-Keebou is amazing.
-You don't say.

141
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,202
Keebou has always been amazing.

142
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,243
There are two entrances,
one at the front and one at the back.

143
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,945
We'll divide into two groups
and fortify the defenses.

144
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,282
Keebou, you'll stay with Hikari…

145
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,083
in this room.

146
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,318
Why?

147
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,120
In case they break our defenses,

148
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,355
you will protect Hikari.

149
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,991
Okay.

150
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,328
Well, we'll never let them break
our defenses,

151
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,196
Hikari.

152
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,066
I can't tell you why,

153
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,468
but they will never harm you.

154
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,270
What?

155
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,273
So don't worry.

156
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,644
I'm not worried.

157
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,689
I think Miss Mifumi should go.

158
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,793
Maybe there is something that
she wants to settle, too.

159
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,505
INCOMING CALL

160
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,279
Hello?

161
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,348
<i>Shuntaro?</i>

162
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,551
<i>You've finally answered my call.</i>

163
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,855
<i>Will I not see you again?</i>

164
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,626
No.

165
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,797
<i>I'll be on my own if you're not with me…</i>

166
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,736
Be on your own, then, Shiho.

167
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,774
We'll separate from each other
properly for once.

168
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,477
If not…

169
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,146
We'll never be able to love anyone again.

170
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,285
I'll hang up now.

171
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:54,954
<i>Shuntaro…</i>

172
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,758
<i>Thank you.</i>

173
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,229
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

174
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,549
How long have you been there?

175
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,220
You actually can love someone, Choco.

176
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,655
Yes?

177
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,025
I mean, no matter how you think about it,

178
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,695
that was love.

179
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,999
It's love.

180
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,569
Don't look so cocky, idiot!

181
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,371
It is love.

182
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,542
-We can see them on the monitors!
-Keebou.

183
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,980
-Wow!
-Melos.

184
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,852
-It's mine?
-Yeah.

185
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,120
When did you make it?

186
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,223
This brings back a lot of memories,
and it has touched my heart,

187
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,392
but wearing this at this age is a bit…

188
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,326
Let's do it!

189
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,495
Wearing it gets me in high spirits!

190
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,764
-You're so cool!
-Check it out!

191
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,734
What are you doing, Keebou?
Get changed already!

192
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,701
Miki, you too?

193
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:27,079
WHO ARE YOU

194
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,381
Maybe…

195
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,818
it will sound stupid when I say it,

196
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,522
but I'm glad that you're here.

197
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,992
Today, until midnight,

198
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,528
when a new day begins,

199
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,731
we will die to protect Hikari.

200
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,940
<i>They're here.</i>

201
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,531
One, two…

202
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,010
It is no use putting up any resistance.

203
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,980
Surrender at once and release the girl!

204
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,115
Go!

205
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,786
In your face!

206
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,721
Idiots!

207
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,291
Hang on!

208
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,794
It will be dangerous if there is any
spark near the liquid.

209
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,834
Retreat! Fall back! Now!

210
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,402
One, two…

211
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,537
Go!

212
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,973
One, two…

213
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,614
Now you see how powerful 398 crow
netting No.eight is!

214
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,184
Your wife has bought a wide range
of things!

215
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,419
Yeah.

216
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,920
In your face!

217
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,973
It is okay, Hikari.

218
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,875
Yeah.

219
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,543
I know.

220
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,746
After everything I've been through,

221
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,015
I'll fight with you, too.

222
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,366
CALLER UNKNOWN

223
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,271
-Hello?
-<i>Are you Kiichi Segawa?</i>

224
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,341
This is my last warning.

225
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,044
Listen to me and hand the girl over to us.

226
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,413
I'll spare your life if you do now.

227
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,384
Where did you get their cellphone number?

228
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,588
<i>I've gotten hold of</i>
<i>all your personal information.</i>

229
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,458
<i>Why don't you give up?</i>

230
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,495
<i>You have no chance of winning.</i>

231
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,830
<i>It's obvious if you look at the situation.</i>

232
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,401
We are still on our way
to claim our victory.

233
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,970
We won't be defeated.

234
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,105
I have faith in them.

235
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,341
<i>You have faith?</i>

236
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:48,347
How many times have you been
deceived and betrayed?

237
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,483
<i>You never know when they're going to</i>
<i>betray you.</i>

238
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,720
<i>Even the people who seem to be</i>
<i>your ally now.</i>

239
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,289
<i>Trust is only an illusion.</i>

240
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,527
<i>Everybody knows that it does not exist.</i>

241
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,429
That's why people sound each other out,

242
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,066
<i>they hide things from, deceive,</i>
<i>and trick each other.</i>

243
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,369
<i>That is why they need to be controlled.</i>

244
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,305
<i>Whoever disrupts order will be</i>
<i>thoroughly eliminated,</i>

245
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,674
<i>and all personal information</i>
<i>will be made public</i>

246
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,310
<i>in our clean world.</i>

247
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,879
<i>Don't you think it's wonderful?</i>

248
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,450
<i>Betrayal cannot possibly happen.</i>

249
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,956
What the heck? This is absurd.

250
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,994
<i>Being betrayed is no big deal.</i>

251
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,763
When you trust someone,

252
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,566
it includes the betrayal as well.

253
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,004
You don't trust someone because
you know they won't betray you.

254
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,408
Trust is when you accept it
if someone betrays you.

255
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,245
That is what trust is.

256
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,548
<i>The person betrays you</i>

257
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,218
<i>because something forces them to.</i>

258
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,021
<i>The person who betrayed me</i>

259
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,724
<i>would suffer and feel the pain</i>
<i>more than me.</i>

260
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,563
<i>The guys and I all know that,</i>
<i>so I trust them wholeheartedly.</i>

261
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:17,036
We do not need your world.

262
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,642
You can continue to follow this
naïve and foolish heroism.

263
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,979
That's the end of my warning.

264
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,094
Miki!

265
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,437
Come on, you're still wearing that?

266
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,507
Why didn't you wear yours?
You still have it, don't you?

267
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,476
Of course!

268
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,655
In your face!

269
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,657
<i>Do you know…</i>

270
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,593
<i>that the riot squad is attacking</i>

271
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,862
some good citizens who are unarmed.

272
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,832
Rainman probably put them up to it.

273
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,734
All of you are involved?

274
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,139
I have no right to say this,

275
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,443
because I was used as well,
and committed a serious crime.

276
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,446
That's exactly why I'd like to ask you.

277
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,614
Hey.

278
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,320
Why did you become a police officer?

279
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,622
For the power or money?

280
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,459
Because you want an umbrella, so
that you can get out of the rain?

281
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,330
It was because you wanted to
become a hero, wasn't it?

282
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,732
Is that what you want to say?

283
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,569
-This is stupid.
-I wanted to be a hero.

284
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,239
I wanted to be a knight in shining
armor! Hero!

285
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,207
Kick him out at once!

286
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,843
I believe that…

287
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,779
there are still heroes among us!

288
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,583
Like he trusted me from the bottom
of his heart,

289
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,454
I believe in the conscience
that you possess as a police officer!

290
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,771
You…

291
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,774
Please stop the Glorious Ark.

292
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,509
Please.

293
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,513
You're the only one who can do that.

294
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,685
I wonder why they can
sacrifice their lives.

295
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,756
<i>Just for a child</i>
<i>who is not related to them.</i>

296
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,628
<i>They never think that</i>
<i>they will be defeated.</i>

297
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,831
<i>They have no chance of winning</i>
<i>no matter how you look at it.</i>

298
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,501
<i>Rainman is a devil</i>

299
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:07,673
<i>who would force a wailing girl</i>
<i>to kill her own father.</i>

300
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,076
<i>It's because they have faith in…</i>

301
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,580
themselves and their friends

302
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,682
from the bottom of their hearts.

303
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,386
That's what your believers do, too.

304
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,891
They trust you from the bottom
of their hearts.

305
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,161
They want to be useful to you,

306
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,698
so they risk their lives
and fight for you.

307
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,735
They threw away everything

308
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,671
just for you.

309
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,811
Why…

310
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,046
do they do that?

311
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,315
That's because they love you!

312
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,219
They want your words of praise.

313
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,657
They want your love.

314
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,196
Because they think that…

315
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,433
it's okay for them to stay alive,

316
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,105
and they're people who are
worthy to stay alive

317
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,675
if they do so.

318
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,013
Go away.

319
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,482
You can kill me if you want!

320
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,152
-But please stop them!
-Just go!

321
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,763
What about him…

322
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,966
that makes you do this for him?

323
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,969
Both you and those people.

324
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,071
Mr. Segawa…

325
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,442
We only knew each other
for a short period of time,

326
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,246
but he trusted me wholeheartedly.

327
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,049
You should know

328
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,385
how happy…

329
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,755
this made me feel.

330
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,958
I'm so happy that…

331
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,429
I can risk my life to repay him.

332
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,437
You were also…

333
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,940
like Mr. Segawa.

334
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,446
The reason why people loved you
when you were a child

335
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:32,617
must be because
you were a very nice person.

336
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,123
Will you tell me one thing?

337
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,525
Am I…

338
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,595
God's messenger?

339
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,565
Or am I…

340
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,901
the devil's instrument?

341
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,907
You are…

342
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,511
Human.

343
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:05,384
And Mr. Segawa will say…

344
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,788
"You are…

345
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,158
who you are."

346
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,034
Keebou!

347
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,345
How do you explain that?

348
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,148
Ryugasaki!

349
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,756
I will go to the police now.

350
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,193
I have to tell them everything that
my sister had done,

351
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,095
and atone for our sins.

352
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,933
Thank you.

353
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,968
For trusting me.

354
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,871
And telling me…

355
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,075
to believe in myself.

356
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,978
When you come back,

357
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,781
I've something to tell you.

358
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,717
I'll be waiting for you.

359
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,394
Chancellor, thank you for your help.

360
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,598
I guess we're even now.

361
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,201
Yeah.

362
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,544
I'm tired now, Patrasche.

363
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,013
-What?
-It's A Dog of Flanders!

364
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,481
You've told me.

365
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,389
I'm quitting for real this time.

366
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,500
There's no way I'm doing it.
It's embarrassing.

367
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,271
Okay.

368
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,941
-Let's go.
-Yes, Boss…

369
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,717
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HIKARI

370
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,886
Hikari, make a wish.

371
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,423
You have to do it before you
blow out the candles.

372
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,091
-That's a stylish tradition.
-A Western one?

373
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,961
-Okay, tell us your wish, Hikari.
-She has to say it?

374
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,896
Let us hear your wish, Hikari.

375
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,404
I was…

376
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,941
very scared

377
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,243
before I met Keebou.

378
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,280
<i>I didn't remember anything,</i>

379
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,416
<i>and I didn't even know who I was.</i>

380
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,353
<i>But after I met Keebou,</i>

381
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,522
<i>I knew right away…</i>

382
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,792
<i>that I could trust him.</i>

383
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,629
<i>When I met the rest of you, too,</i>

384
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,998
<i>I knew that right away as well.</i>

385
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,270
So I want to become someone like you guys.

386
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,874
I want to become someone who is

387
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,310
not just protected by someone,
but who can protect others as well.

388
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:33,952
Hikari,

389
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,154
the candles are melting.

390
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,690
Choco, too.

391
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,527
Blow the candles out with me, Choco.

392
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,731
-Why?
-Just do it.

393
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,600
How scary.

394
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,202
Do it now!
The wax will drop on to the cake.

395
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,937
Blow the candles now!

396
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,806
Choco, be more sensitive!

397
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,009
Fine.

398
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,578
Ready, go…

399
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,221
Choco.

400
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,124
I'm so happy.

401
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,827
It is the smell of happiness.

402
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,609
Oh? Is he crying?

403
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,611
-Yes, he is.
-Wow, Choco is crying!

404
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,613
-I'm not crying, idiots!
-You are crying!

405
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,816
Your eyes will swell this much again.

406
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,385
Gosh, Choco!

407
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,756
I knew it.

408
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,058
I knew that wasn't the end of this.

409
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,831
And he timed it perfectly.

410
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,368
<i>I'll say it only once more.</i>

411
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,671
<i>Hand over the girl.</i>

412
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,841
Of course we won't do that.

413
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,577
<i>I see.</i>

414
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,581
<i>All of you have to be eliminated,</i>
<i>just as I thought.</i>

415
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,651
<i>To express it in the</i>
<i>vulgar terms that you use,</i>

416
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,021
<i>you are "incorrigible morons".</i>

417
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,025
<i>The game is over.</i>

418
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,828
<i>People will be there to get her here soon.</i>

419
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,464
<i>The number of people</i>

420
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,800
<i>is 100.</i>

421
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,503
100 people?

422
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,724
They've got some very nasty weapons.

423
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,728
Miki, I'll go with you guys, too. Okay?

424
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,030
100 people, huh?

425
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,667
It's 100 people.

426
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,303
This is a clever arrangement.

427
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,505
We won't be defeated this time.

428
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,073
Of course we won't.

429
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,809
Keebou is here this time.

430
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,244
-And we have one more on our side.
-Yes!

431
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,846
Okay, let's go.

432
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,614
Hang on.

433
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,584
Keebou, didn't you tell me

434
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,221
that they would never harm me?

435
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,439
Put down your weapons.

436
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,475
If you fire, you could hit Hikari.

437
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,612
-You use a girl as your shield?
-Of course not!

438
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,681
We are her shield!

439
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,284
We won't let you

440
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,220
get even a step into this circle!

441
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,656
Hikari.

442
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,992
Close your eyes until we tell you
to open them.

443
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,235
Remove weapons.

444
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,379
30 more minutes!

445
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,949
You guys really are idiots.

446
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:26,918
Do you know that

447
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,887
in the world,

448
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,022
the nicer you are, the more stupid
people think you are.

449
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,026
I wonder why people look down on
those who are kindhearted.

450
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,061
Honest people are deceived,

451
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,898
and only hard working people
have to suffer.

452
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,199
Seize them!

453
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,838
Perhaps he is right.

454
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,742
The world is helpless, dull
and not interesting at all,

455
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,011
and you can't do anything easily!

456
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,414
So I'm so glad to have met you!

457
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,916
I'm so glad to have met you all!

458
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,486
Go.

459
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,658
20 more minutes!

460
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,661
Thank you, Hikari!

461
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,430
For bringing me to the guys again,

462
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,599
and for letting me meet Melos!

463
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,235
I should be the one…

464
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,736
I should be the one to say thank you!

465
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,072
Say it now, Melos!

466
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,574
Say it now!

467
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,580
Who are you?

468
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:31,950
I am…

469
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,519
Myself!

470
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,790
Ten more minutes!

471
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,795
I thought I couldn't fly anymore,

472
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,263
because the burden was too heavy.

473
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,599
Until you came back.

474
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,102
I know this now, Keebou.

475
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,238
If I can't put down the burden,

476
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,275
then I only have to make
my wings stronger!

477
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,646
On the contrary, mine is too light.

478
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,614
I was like floating in mid-air,

479
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,184
and I thought that was how much
I was worth.

480
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,652
Thank you, Keebou!

481
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,521
For letting me carry Hikari
on my shoulders.

482
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,990
My feet have touched the ground
for the first time.

483
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,995
What is this, the time to say
something cool?

484
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,097
-I can't come up with any!
-Same here!

485
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,900
But don't worry, Pon, you're quite cool.

486
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,703
You, too, Pi.

487
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,206
I had forgotten for a long time, Keebou,

488
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,441
that we were actually very cool!

489
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,677
It's easier to forget,

490
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,847
and get looked down on, do whatever
people say and laugh foolishly!

491
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,217
But Keebou, when I met you again,
I remembered this…

492
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,719
-Don't you dare look down on us!
-We are…

493
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,921
Very cool…

494
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,628
Three more minutes!

495
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,733
I'm having so much fun now!

496
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,470
I'll tell my children…

497
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:05,209
that there will be a lot of agonies
and sadness in their lives,

498
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,045
so they have to find their friends.

499
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,547
Find the best friends

500
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:13,217
who you can laugh with when going
through hell if you're with them!

501
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,890
One more minute!

502
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,925
Okay…

503
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,350
Until we win…

504
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,553
Don't be defeated!

505
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,229
Ten more seconds!

506
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,597
We will win!

507
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:07,572
Five, four, three, two…

508
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,973
Yes!

509
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,914
Hikari, you can open your eyes now.

510
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,329
Keebou.

511
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,575
Hikari!

512
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,750
No! You can kill me,

513
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,485
-but don't make Hikari…
-Shut up!

514
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,823
Rainman's succession ritual
will be performed as of now.

515
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,495
Get him!

516
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,365
Come here!

517
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,035
Give me back!

518
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,306
-I can't let Rainman end!
-Of course I won't give you back!

519
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,475
Have you thought about…

520
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,579
how much lazy and incapable
losers like you

521
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,915
have kept victors from succeeding?

522
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,017
In our ideal country…

523
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,819
What are the victors and victory
that you are talking about?

524
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:34,125
To me it doesn't look at all like
you have won!

525
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,762
He is right.

526
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,203
You lost the battle, Ryugasaki.

527
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,738
This is the end of the story.

528
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,041
I will be

529
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,710
the last Rainman.

530
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:56,714
You can't do that. If the rain stops,

531
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,918
-this country will…
-Rain stops.

532
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,890
But the sun doesn't disappear.

533
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,960
Even when it is raining,

534
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,630
it is shining above the clouds.

535
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,367
It will never be realized.

536
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,269
Because…

537
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,907
it is the sun that produces rain.

538
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,986
Sunlight,

539
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,121
flowers,

540
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,425
and a populated village.

541
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,365
That's what Hikari means.

542
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,769
I gave Hikari her name.

543
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,807
My name…

544
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,577
Yoko…

545
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,746
means the sun.

546
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,215
It is the name

547
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,783
that my mother gave me.

548
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:12,556
No mother would ever wish her daughter…

549
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,194
to live a life that is…

550
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,498
as awful as being exposed

551
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,000
to the cold rain.

552
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,605
Hikari will be all right.

553
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,944
Because she is exactly like
what her name means.

554
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,781
So…

555
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,583
Don't worry.

556
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:42,987
Thank you.

557
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,062
For giving her

558
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,097
hope…

559
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,968
and light.

560
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,852
Fua, Yua, this is Daddy.

561
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,589
Oh, Noriaki, you have to deliver
the clothes.

562
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,025
You don't want to separate from
Daddy, do you?

563
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,661
-You have to go, come on.
-Hang on…

564
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,562
She…

565
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,933
-What's the matter?
-Fua's eyes somehow look like Choco's!

566
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,168
Ouch! It hurts!

567
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,438
-They are your children!
-I'm sorry.

568
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,574
I was kidding.

569
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,715
-I'm sorry!
-No need to apologize.

570
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,788
I think I'm going to

571
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,624
wear this when we go to visit
Masayoshi in your summer holiday.

572
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,194
What do you think?

573
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,267
Why not? It really suits you.

574
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,770
Mom.

575
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,609
He called me Mom…

576
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,881
Bikini! A white one!

577
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,649
Mom!

578
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,952
-I'll click it, Saya.
-Wait, Pichan!

579
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,489
Buying a house online is a bit…

580
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,658
But it's on special offer, Saya,

581
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,294
-and it's got a garden!
-I know, but…

582
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,899
I'm happy enough to live here,
as long as you're with me.

583
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,469
This is so sweet, Saya!

584
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,306
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PURCHASE.

585
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,176
He just clicked the button.

586
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,813
Great! I will work my ass off, Saya!

587
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,782
Oh! Pichan, I love you!

588
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,717
You'll really do that?

589
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,221
There was a sharp rise in the amount
of shoplifting during your absence.

590
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,925
I have no idea why an idiot like you
can prevent so many crimes.

591
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,695
-Manager! Thank you!
-Hey…

592
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,398
I'm so happy for you, Teppei!

593
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,067
-Teppei?
-Hana!

594
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,903
-Hana?
-Oh…

595
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,872
Since when have you two…

596
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,107
Sorry that I didn't tell you, Big bro.

597
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,311
-Big bro!
-Shush!

598
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,012
Call me Manager in the supermarket!

599
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,914
You promised you'd pretend
we weren't related!

600
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,617
But your surnames…

601
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,720
I married into her family.

602
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,055
What?

603
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,095
Miki!

604
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,064
Long time no see.

605
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,604
Why are you here? You moved to Tokyo
when you got married, right?

606
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,473
I got divorced and I'm back.

607
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,010
What are you doing here?

608
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,311
How is everyone?

609
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,247
-How are Pichan and Tenten?
-Good.

610
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:01,085
Kayo! Long time no see!

611
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,189
Minny!

612
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,726
I'm so happy that you remember me!
Yes, I'm Minny!

613
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,195
You often treated me to
the curry you make.

614
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,163
You look so lovely!

615
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,834
I'm not lovely now, I've grown old!

616
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,703
How have you been?
We haven't met for a long time!

617
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,706
Your smile is still very bright.

618
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,174
Thank you.

619
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,016
I thought you said you were a housewife?

620
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,920
I was never married…

621
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,357
to begin with.

622
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,198
Then why did you lie to me?

623
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,034
Because…

624
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:56,140
A single and poor ordinary
middle-aged woman

625
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,576
wouldn't have interested you.

626
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,013
Well, I guess you're right.

627
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,119
I'm sorry.

628
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,791
When will your shift end today?

629
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,026
What?

630
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,364
Let's go and have dinner.

631
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,273
Come on, don't cry.

632
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,484
Why are you grinning on your own?

633
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,656
It's from Hikari!

634
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,957
Let me see!

635
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,459
Wow!

636
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,165
<i>Keebou, Miki,</i>

637
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,002
<i>Choco, Ponjara,</i>

638
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,838
<i>Pichan, Tenten,</i>

639
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,573
<i>Melos.</i>

640
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,042
<i>I've found some friends, too.</i>

641
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,544
<i>I've found some friends with whom</i>

642
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,446
<i>I can be myself when I am around them.</i>

643
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,749
<i>Someday the little band of us</i>

644
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,917
<i>will go to see you together.</i>

645
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,857
I guess the "you" means me.

646
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,659
Idiot, of course it's not!

647
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,160
It's Keebou she misses most.

648
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,328
We only play a minor role.

649
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,796
Brilliantly, though.

650
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,732
Well, Miki…

651
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,136
Something is bothering me.

652
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,203
What?

653
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,777
What is this key for?

654
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,745
Don't pursue that issue.

655
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,882
-Why?
-Well…

656
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,017
I sense more trouble coming.

657
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,318
Please help me!

658
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,856
You see?

659
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,925
I've lost my way.

660
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,067
