Um, I mean those, pencils.

Um, Faber-Castell pencils are great,
aren't they?

15
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,500
I wanted some,
but they're a bit expensive.

00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,208
I heard Chagall or someone
like that used them too.

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,083
Van Gogh used to use these pencils.

Were you going to jump off

No.

[girl giggles] I'm joking.

Yeah. Yeah, a friend.

Hey, by the way,
I don't think that's funny.

-You shouldn't joke about going to heaven.
-It's true, though.

It is.

are you not afraid?

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,708
Of dying.

You don't… look like you're afraid.

I'm not afraid.

I've known for a while
that I don't have a lot of time left.

Just imagine the view from all the way up.

It's gotta be nicer than down here,
being stuck in a hospital.

Heaven is nice.

58

Looking forward to it, I guess.

do you?

I mean, you're a pro

If you need a new palette,
we can get you one.

71
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,000
[Akito] It's fine.

72
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,333
It'd be a waste of money.

73
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,083
Buy Natsumi that new lacrosse stick
she wanted instead.

74

[gasps] What! No way? The Crux Pro?

Right, then, everyone.

[Akito] <i>A malignant tumor?</i>

97

[doctor] It's not very common
for tumors to form in the heart,

98
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,583
but they can.

99
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,791
On very rare occasions,
a tumor can grow on the heart.

-[doctor] You don't have long.

102
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,375
It depends whether it spreads or not,

103
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,166
but I'd say that you have
about a year left to live.

[Akito] <i>There's no way I could tell her.</i>

166
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,416
Uh, is it okay to check this out?

167
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,708
Yeah, sure you can.

168
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,041
Oh wow, look at these.
Miss Sakurai, you're very good.

169
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,250
Did you take classes?

170
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,333
[Haruna] No.

171
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,500
I've never even been to a real art museum.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,875
Seriously?

173
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,375
-Oh and you can just call me Haruna.
-Huh?

174
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,666
[chuckles]

175
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,500
So, then, Haruna…

176
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,708
how is it that you can… draw like this?

177
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
[Haruna inhales]

178
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, it's 'cause

179
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,625
it's the one place I find freedom.

180
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,750
It's like time and space

181
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,083
are no longer these big obstacles
whenever I'm drawing.

182
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,416
It's amazing.

183
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,333
I can paint my illness away
and fly to wherever I wanna fly to.

184
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,416
If anything ever bothers you,

185
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,083
I can just paint all of it away for you.

186

[delicate piano music plays]

187

Oh is this school

188
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,666
with the Kinjiro statue Aoba Junior High?

189
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,791
Yeah, I went there.

190
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,666
Somehow I was hardly ever there.

191
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,166
I used to go past there on my bike a lot.

192
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,125
I think a student in my
art club went there as well.

193
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,416
Takada. Yeah.

194
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,333
Oh really?

195
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,125
Well, then, do you know

196
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,000
where the elementary school is
on the page before?

197
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,791
[Akito] You two look close.

198
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,958
Is this a friend of yours, right here?

199
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,166
[Haruna] Yeah, something like that.

200
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,625
That person was a friend, yeah.

201
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,916

Sorry about that.

-Is this a friend?

00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,000
-[Haruna] Yeah.
-Don't get too many of those, huh?

209
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,083
Uh, I guess I'll just, uh, go, then.

210
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,958
[Haruna] Mm.

[Haruna inhales, exhales]

212
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,625
[Akito] By the way,

213
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,208
is it okay if I come again?

214
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,333
-Huh?
-I would love to--

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,833
To, um, see some more of your drawings.

216
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,875
[laughs]

217
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:46,916
Yeah, sure.

218
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,125
Your request is granted, you may visit.
[giggles]

219
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,375
But in exchange,
you've gotta bring a present.

220
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,000
A present?

221
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,500
Yeah, a motif to draw.

222
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,458
I'm tired of drawing the things here.

223
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,291
Okay, got it.

224
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,541
I guess I'll see ya later.
You have a good day.

225
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,625
Mm-hm. Yeah, bye.

That's all for today.

228
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,458
I'd like the Culture Committee members
to come to the staff room after class.

-Got that?
-[class] Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

[gentle music continues]

00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,458
Sorry.

Akito!

234
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,375
You're not going to Art Club today either?

235
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,125
Hmm… I think I'm done with Art Club.
I'm tired of it.

236
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,666
You're done? Wait, what?

237
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,583
What about the Nika Art Exhibition?
You were so excited.

238
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,875
Ah, yeah, Nika…

239
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,208
-Hm? How're you guys?
-Hey, what's going on?

240
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,333
Ever since your bike accident,
you're all different.

241
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,625
Oh no, no, no, no.

I'm visiting a friend in the hospital.

I wouldn't recommend a potted plant.

257

They're considered unlucky

258

because their roots are said
to have a bit of disease.

260

uh, something like this?

261
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,750
Oh wow, yeah. They got a lot of color.

262

They look painted.

263
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,291
Those are Gerberas right there.
There's two thousand kinds of them.

Two thousand?

265
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,041
[florist] All have different meanings.

266
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,791
But it doesn't matter
which type you choose,

267
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,250
none of them have
any negative connotation.

268
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,958
It's quite a rare flower in that way.

269
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,458
And since they're so colorful,
they really brighten the mood.

270
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,333
They're great for hospital visits.

Uh… let's go, um, pink, I guess.

275

Pink flowers signify appreciation.
Gratitude.

Is that okay?

277
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,666
Uh… okay, what does, uh, orange signify?

278
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,583
Tolerance and, uh, open-mindedness.

279
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,958
Uh, and the yellow one?

280
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,666
Well, yellow signifies beauty. [giggles]

281
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,166
White is purity and blue is…

282
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,541
And just so you know,
Gerberas in general signify hope.

-They all do.
-Oh yeah, yeah, that!

You're in a lady's room here,
don't you realize that?

00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,833
Sorry. But if it helps,

294
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,875
I did, uh, bring you these.

I love Gerberas, you know?
They're so pretty.

300
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,708
They're supposed to signify hope,
I was told.

301
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,833
The woman selling these recommended
that I get them.

302
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,458
"Hope," huh?

303
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,083
Uh, my bad.

304
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,958
I didn't mean it like that.

305
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,500
[laughs] It's okay. Don't worry.

306
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,250
I think that the word illness

307
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,875
is a truly magical word, really.

308
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,458
Anyone you don't like,

309
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,916
you just say the word illness
and they run away, just like that.

310
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,916
There's only one person
that the magic word didn't work on.

311
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,083
Yeah?

312
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,208
Mm-hm.

Wanna get something to drink
in the common room?

Mm-hm.

315

[Haruna] Oh uh…

316
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,125
Do you have a new friend here?

317
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,291
Uh, yeah. We met on the roof.
This is Akito.

318
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,666
He was born in the fall.

319
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,125
A future Nika award-winner over here.

320
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,041
I see.

321
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,500
Well, I'm sorry to bother you guys,

322
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
though Haruna needs to go
for her physical exam.

323
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,541
Oh yeah.

324
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:46,958
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,666
Mm. It's okay.

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,250
Can we get some drinks next time?

327
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,041
Mm-hm. I'll see ya.

328
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,833
Ah, hold on, uh,

329
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,291
if it's okay with you, then please,

330
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,625
come see us here again.

331
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,375
I will.

00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,750
I heard that you're gonna quit.

00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,125
Uh, yeah. Mm-hm.

344

[Takada] Hmm…

345
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,583
So you're running away.

346
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,583
Well, whatever.

347
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,833
Hey, Takada,

348
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,791
you went to Aoba Junior High, right?

349
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,291
Yeah, why?

350
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,250
Do you remember Haruna Sakurai?

351
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,583
Uh…

352
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,708
I think that she was sick.

353
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,458
I don't really remember.

354
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,166
Was there anyone she was close to?

355
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,583
-Did she have friends, huh?
-Friends?

356
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,708
You know,
she wasn't really ever at school.

357
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,000
Ah, but I think

358
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,500
I did see her a few times
hanging out with that Miura chick.

359
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,458
Miura chick?

360
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,375
The one who's in class with me.

361
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,791
Miura, huh? You mean…

362
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,625
Hey, what do you want?

363
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,458
And who are you?

364
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,208
Hayasaka. I'm, uh,
from the class that is, uh…

365
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,625
Why are you such a weirdo?

366
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,291
Huh? Uh, but…

367
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,541
Not interested, dude.

368
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,625
I can't believe some guys
hit on girls like this.

369
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,958
-[girl 1] Let's go, Ayaka.
-[Ayaka] Yeah.

370
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,750
[Ayaka sighs]

371
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,333
Uh, that's not what this is.

372
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,833
I wanted to ask you something.

373
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:12,750
[Ayaka] Huh?

374
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,333
Um, so why didn't you start with that,
then?

375
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,416
Why do you keep acting
like some kind of weirdo? Ask already.

376
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,416
Do you happen to know Haruna Sakurai?

377
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,458
I heard that you two were close.

378
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,791
[Ayaka] Sorry. You guys go ahead

379
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,458
-[girl 1] Okay.
-[girl 2] Okay.

380
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,666
How do you know Haruna, huh?

381
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,166
Oh you know, uh…

382
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,291
she's just someone that-- that I know.

383
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,833
-Huh?
-Did you ever play on the swings with her?

384
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,625
Or find a kitten in a box with Haruna

385
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,958
when you were a little kid
growing up together?

386
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,000
I see. So she's in the hospital again.

387
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,083
Looks like she's been there
for quite a while this time.

388
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,416
But I seem to be the only person
who goes and visits her.

389
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,375
And I think she'd really love it
if someone else could visit her, you know?

390
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,333
[Ayaka] So you're trying to impress her.

391
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,583
[Akito] No, that's not it!

392
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,666
I just… wanna help.

393
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,708
[Ayaka] It's Akito, right?

394
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,958
I have no intention of visiting Haruna.

395
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,791
I haven't seen her at all
since I've been in high school.

396
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,333
And I wouldn't exactly call
us friends anymore.

397
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,958
I don't think she'd be too thrilled
to see me either.

I heard you're not gonna do Art Club.

She's worried about you, you know?

You should talk to her about it.

Talk to her about what?

414
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,500
You know, I'd feel better
if Eri were by your side right now.

-I'm sure you and--

[Akito's dad] Uh…

Why don't we all go on a family trip
during the next school holiday?

427
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,375
-It's been a while. Yeah.
-A trip?

428
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,458
You said you'd like to go on a…

429
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:34,416
on a sketch trip of Japan
when you got your license.

430

Did I say that?

431

All of Japan may be a bit difficult,
but we can try.

Natsumi says she wants to go too.
We'll go together.

I'm good. You guys go.

434

I'm sure I'd just cause trouble
on the road.

You're never any trouble for us.

You can be selfish, as well.

There's not.

you'd visit me this much.

you'd like to visit you?

[Haruna] Hm…

00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:13,166
What about that girl you said
you were friends with before?

469
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,083
I'd like to see my

470
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,125
father, you know?

471
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,625
-Your father?
-Mm-hm.

473
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,125
Not in five years.

474
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,750
I'd like to apologize to him.

475
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,333
Apologize?

476
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:36,166
He always would… take time
out of his own schedule

477
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,000
to do whatever would make me the happiest.

478
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,041
When I was hospitalized,
no matter how much he had to finish,

479
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,666
my dad would rush over here
as soon as he was done.

[mellow piano music plays]

But, um, he's more
of an outdoor kinda guy.

482
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:55,166
He always hoped to have a kid
who could go camping with him

in any fun together.

485
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,458
So I…

486
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,125
I wanna say sorry
for having this frail body I've got.

487
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,625
I wanna tell him sorry
that I couldn't be a healthier daughter.

Uh, excuse me.

00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,041
You said you're the head nurse, right?

493
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,083
I was wondering about, uh, her family.

494
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,416
[head nurse] Her family?

495

Um, well, it's just

496
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,333
I've never seen them come visit Haruna.

497
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,666
Not sure why, really.
She's not able to see her father?

498
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,791
Not trying to be nosy here,

499
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,166
but could the hospital try
to contact Haruna's father?

500
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,166
Could you do that?

501
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:55,875
I mean…

502
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:59,583
it would be great even
to speak with her mother.

503
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,541
Would you be able to tell me

504
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,208
the next time she'll be here?

505
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,875
[head nurse] Her mother is here.

506
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,291
Huh?

507
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,125
You're looking at her.

[Akito] I'm sorry.

510

I didn't know about that.

511

I'm so sorry.

you're here again.

And I'm sorry I didn't text you back.

822
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,458
That's good to hear.
I was afraid you hated me now.

823
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,583
To tell you the truth,
there's a reason I didn't text you.

Huh?

00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,916
[Haruna] I'm sure you guys are busy
during summer vacation.

827

I'm happy if it worked out.

As your friend, I'm happy for you.

Don't get off the phone just yet.

I won't hang up.

Not till the fireworks are done.

I don't know if I'll see this again,

We're gonna watch again next year.

845
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,083
They told me I only had six months to live
quite a while ago now.

846
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,333
<i>You can do this!</i>

847
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,750
<i>I looked it up,</i>

848
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:36,375
<i>and there are tons of people</i>

<i>Some people live for over ten years.</i>

I mean, it could even be a misdiagnosis.

851
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,666
So…

To tell you the truth, uh…

I really do, um--

[melancholy music fades out]

[Shota] Why didn't you tell us?

870
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,375
If I'd told you,
it would've felt like my own funeral.

871
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,208
I didn't want…

872
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,833
to put that on you.

873
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,000
To have you go through that.

874
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:30,250
[Shota] I mean, even if you had told us,
I know there's nothing we could've done.

875
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:33,958
Still, I…

876
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,708
I wish you'd told us.

877
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,250
That's what best friends are for.

878
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,041
Sorry.

879
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,333
Thank you.

880
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:01,625
Can you come back to school?

881
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,833
Yeah.

882
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:06,791
They said after the summer
I can go back, so next semester.

883
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:07,708
[Haruna's mom] Akito?

884
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,541
[Haruna's mom] This comes as a shock.

885
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:18,791
Please, can you…

886
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:23,708
Can you please not, um, not tell Haruna?

887
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,875
Being told that I didn't have long,
I-- I was afraid, but then

888
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,791
she gave me a reason to live.

889
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,125
She gave me something to hold onto.

I'm sorry that it's a… a selfish reason.

893
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:54,541
But I, uh, I want her
to enjoy her time now, instead of…

894
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,791
of looking forward to--

895
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,083
To heaven.

00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,791
I could be in denial as well.

901
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,375
Huh?

902
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,041

-You're right.

She thinks I should become
a nail technician.

-Then I'll be your first customer.
-Oh!

Are you into Haruna or what?

it only prolongs my life a little, right?

1041
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,375
But, Akito, don't you think
it's worth a shot anyway?

1042

Because if the surgery's successful,
you could do the Nika Art Exhibition.

No way.

Why not?

1288
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,750
I'd like to see…

what you've been working on.

1290

Huh?

1291
01:19:57,083 --> 01:20:00,041
It's not fair. You get to see mine.

1292
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:06,166
Hey.

1293
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,083
Can you draw me?

Do you remember the day that we first met?

1311
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:19,791
Why did you… start talking to me
on that certain day?

1312
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:23,458
Uh…

1313
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,708
I was in a bad place
and then someone saved me.

1314
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,500
An angel.

[gentle piano music continues]

1323
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,083
That girl that I saw…

1324
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,750
she only had six months to live,

1325
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,958
but she wasn't afraid.

1326
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:05,375
I thought that was incredible.

1327

Really, really, incredible.

1328

No.

1329

That was the day that I

found out I had six months left.

1331
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,750
It was earlier that day.

1332
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,083
It was something I already knew.

1333
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:36,500
But when it actually came down to it,

1334
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,041
I was so afraid.

I wanted to die soon, right?

1347
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,666
At that time, I really thought that I did.

1348
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:40,583
I feel differently now.

1349

I don't wanna die yet.

1350

I just wanna live.

I wanna…

and also with Aya.

1354
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:15,958
I don't need…

1355
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:21,625
ten years, or twenty years…

1356
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,250
Even just one day…

one minute, one second more.

1358
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,500
I wanna live longer.

1359
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,708
I decided that after being
with both of you.

1360
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:46,958
So from now on,
I will fight this illness every day.

1361
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:51,166
If I don't die today, it's my win.

1376
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:42,041
and even under perfect conditions,
there's a low success rate,
