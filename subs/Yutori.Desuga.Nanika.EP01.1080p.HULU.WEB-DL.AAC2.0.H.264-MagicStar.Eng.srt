1
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:06,774
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,776
What? Yutori?

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:12,646
Born in 1987...

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,814
and 29 years old?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,386
It is usually referred to as
the first pressure-free generation.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,354
I thought for sure that it would be
my younger sister's generation.

7
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,190
Starting from the 2003
high school fresh admissions,

8
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:27,228
an amendment to the curriculum
guideline was applied.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,130
- The schools were...
- Public schools.

10
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,965
- Right.
- Five day week?

11
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,099
Right.

12
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,036
That is pressure-free indeed.

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,437
(Yutori).

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,805
Has anyone said that about you?

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,508
Yes.

16
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,777
Just in case, I had attached
and sent the G-Map link...

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,814
Even so, on a first visit,
you should meet at the station,

18
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,216
and you should reach
10 minutes earlier. Seriously...

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,618
It hurts.

20
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,987
That's why you are called a Yutori!

21
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,424
I thought it meant that I
looked younger than my real age,

22
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,725
and was happy about it.

23
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:08,202
Since this is the first time, let me
take notes during our conversation.

24
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:12,740
Second year in the company,...
What was his again?

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,941
Yamagishi.

26
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,944
But...

27
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,846
if I'm also a Yutori...

28
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,815
the story is different.

29
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,850
I didn't know the way,
so I took a taxi from the station.

30
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:26,887
- Didn't I send the map via G-Map?
- I was too busy to check my mail.

31
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:30,424
Next time, please use LINE.
Good day.

32
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,992
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

33
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,662
I am sorry, Mr Nogami,
he is the new person in charge...

34
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,130
I am Yamagishi.

35
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:40,101
Just putting this forward, I am the
type who grows with compliments.

36
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,101
I see.

37
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,672
Although my real
ambition lies in marketing,

38
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,342
being in sales...

39
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,679
and getting a feel from the ground;
from a long term perspective,

40
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,814
it's not bad.

41
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:57,051
I thought that, for sure,
was a pressure-free person.

42
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,352
Am I included too?

43
00:01:58,853 --> 00:01:59,720
Well...

44
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,556
If your companion is late,

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,860
you should go ahead first
to explain the situation.

46
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,930
Indeed, it was hard to tell
who was late.

47
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,366
Sorry.

48
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,504
I'm acting like
a difficult superior.

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,438
No, you're not.

50
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,074
- He is not that difficult.
- Really?

51
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,409
Maybe it wasn't a good idea
to refuse the invitation.

52
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,012
- Why did you refuse?
- If I go, I might get told off.

53
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,780
- Really?
- Ah, but...

54
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,482
Yamagishi is even worse than me.

55
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,384
- Is it compulsory?
- Eh?

56
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,520
Do we have to
join the drinking party?

57
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,991
It is not compulsory but...

58
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,893
- Then I shall not attend.
- May I know the reason?

59
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,863
- I feel sluggish.
- Your body?

60
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,598
- What?
- Because they will ask me,

61
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,301
"what happened to Yamagishi".
Sluggish is referring to your body?

62
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,240
Well then, yes, that is the reason.

63
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,144
Yes. Hello.

64
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,280
This is Yamagishi, who
grows with your compliments.

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,549
So I pass on the message
as it is and then...

66
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,384
that line pops up again.

67
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,253
That's why you are called a Yutori!

68
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,088
I couldn't stand it any more

69
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,558
so I went home quickly.

70
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,728
I want to do something about these
pent up frustrations,

71
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,564
lately things have not been
going well my girlfriend.

72
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,932
My friends are getting busy too.

73
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,035
Just as I thought
of watching AV at home...

74
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,305
"Rental Uncle"

75
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,646
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

76
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,681
I got a shock.

77
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,852
All are good.

78
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,694
Malibu beach.

79
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,028
I like it.

80
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,598
Recently...

81
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,035
I have not ridden on it.

82
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:57,638
The waves.

83
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,941
So this was your deciding move?

84
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,310
Well, I thought that
it was foolish of me.

85
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,151
- You got all out of your chest?
- Well, yes.

86
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:15,089
Instead, now I'm the one who's
feeling the pent up stress...

87
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,025
We're just getting
to the main story.

88
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,260
- Unfortunately, the time is up.
- What?

89
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,562
2000 yen for 2 hours,

90
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,732
plus 1550 yen for the coffee latte
and BLT sandwich.

91
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,233
The transportation fee is 2000 yen.

92
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,402
- That is expensive.
- Because I came from Kamakura.

93
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,604
May I extend the time?

94
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,007
My next customer is already here...

95
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:41,115
I have done all I can, so...

96
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,283
He didn't...

97
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,086
He didn't...

98
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,023
He didn't have to say it like that,
right?

99
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,059
Please calm down.

100
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,927
Do you need some water?

101
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,300
But the vice principal...

102
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,271
...told me to prioritize their
training for the sports competition.

103
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,508
The guardians...

104
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,510
...told me that their
study is behind schedule.

105
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,379
The children...

106
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,052
- Do not even listen to me.
- Well...

107
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,188
I do not know who is listening,
so please calm...

108
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,990
If they lose in the relay,

109
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:24,658
they'll say
it is the fault of the teacher.

110
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,694
Saying that is alright not to be
the number 1,

111
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,429
but the bashing if they lose...

112
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,398
- Isn't that weird?
- That is weird.

113
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,769
Eh, you are still here?

114
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,272
Sorry, I did not
feel like going home.

115
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,642
I got all out of my chest.

116
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,744
- Eh?
- It is just about time.

117
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,779
No, but nothing has been solved.

118
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,650
You can split the transportation fee
with Mr Sakama.

119
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,299
- Work hard.
- Thank you.

120
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,071
Well,

121
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:13,907
that guy...

122
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,811
only needs someone
to listen to him.

123
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,216
Thank you.

124
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,888
Wait! Oh, sorry!

125
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,224
Wait! Wait!

126
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,495
Does this bus
go to the train station?

127
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,030
The next bus
is heading to the station.

128
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,799
Then I will get off.

129
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,103
Sorry.

130
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,005
Sorry.

131
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,314
The door is closing.

132
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,524
Eight minutes.

133
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,838
- Just now... You first.
- You first. What is it?

134
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,974
Well... Just now...

135
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,810
sorry for showing you
something unsightly.

136
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,845
No, I am the one who was disturbing.

137
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,150
- Do you often use this service?
- The rental uncle?

138
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,820
- Yes.
- Yes, once in a while.

139
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,990
- Was that your first time?
- Yes.

140
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,927
It is better than going
to my company drinking party.

141
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,229
- It was my farewell party though...
- Eh?

142
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,864
I will be working in the shop
from tomorrow.

143
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,034
I was transferred
because my results were not good.

144
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,203
Project, promotion and sales...

145
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,672
I have been rolling from
department to department.

146
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,674
I lied that it was the 49th day
after my dad's death,

147
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,175
and ignored the party.

148
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,279
Are you kidding?

149
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,887
Last month...

150
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,090
...my father passed away.

151
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,433
Sorry! I spoiled the mood.

152
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,034
Not at all.

153
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,738
Oh yes, this is my business card.

154
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,643
This doesn't mean anything, so...

155
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,644
Here.

156
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,215
- I know this.
- Torinotami, the shop at Kouenshi.

157
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,551
Two Yakitori per drink.

158
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,152
100 sheets here
so you can have 200 Yakitori.

159
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,022
- This is too much...
- I planned to throw it anyway.

160
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,101
Do you have any plans after this?

161
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,405
If you are OK,
let's go to that farewell party...

162
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,008
You seem to have plans.

163
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,278
- No, I don't have any.
- But...

164
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,714
Ah, this is...

165
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,952
I've been trying to call my
girlfriend from just now, but...

166
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,922
The number you have dialed...

167
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,224
...is current out of service.

168
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,027
- It's strange.
- Maybe...

169
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,363
...she has changed her number?

170
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:25,966
Sorry.

171
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:31,772
What will you do?

172
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,242
I still have tomorrow...

173
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,647
so I am going home for the day.

174
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,520
Could you be...

175
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,890
a Yutori?

176
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,425
Yes, I'm a Yutori...

177
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,727
is there a problem?

178
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,720
WE'RE MILLENIALS.
GOT A PROBLEM?

179
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,531
Masa, get Yutori.

180
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,472
Yutori! Wake up!

181
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,642
- Ah, ouch!
- Sorry, sorry.

182
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,511
You are late.

183
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,146
I told you.
I'll be store keeping from today.

184
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,348
- Need a ride to the station?
- Yes, please.

185
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,017
It stinks.

186
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,523
Ma-Chan, get Yutori.

187
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,692
That kid is having an interview.

188
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,726
Okay.

189
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,132
Yutori!

190
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:09,369
- What are you doing, wake up!
- I am awake.

191
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,171
Stop calling me Yutori.

192
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,173
Good morning.

193
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,910
Yutori, your resume!

194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,979
Good morning.

195
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,681
Thank you. I am leaving now.

196
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,822
Ah... wait!

197
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,606
(Torinotami)

198
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,643
Good morning.

199
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,646
- I am Sakama from the head office.
- You came in a suit.

200
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,348
- Ah, sorry.
- Over there.

201
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,651
Everyone from the head
office will be the shop manager.

202
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,787
But I do not know
if you will be called so...

203
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,796
Wait!

204
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,266
In other words,
four weeks starting from today.

205
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,504
Sakura sensei
will be your teacher.

206
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,806
- How about Yamaji?
- I will be watching from behind.

207
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,642
Eh? You're making things difficult!

208
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,277
Yes!

209
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,947
Okay, listen.

210
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,315
Listen to Yamaji's words.

211
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,784
Yamaji is responsible
for teaching Sakura sensei

212
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,086
the method for teaching.

213
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,390
- Thank you for your guidance.
- No,

214
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,758
I am a new comer too.

215
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,930
Be quiet.

216
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,365
Where should you put your hands?

217
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,901
Yes, on your knees.

218
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,471
Then, close your eyes.

219
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,141
Flip the study switch...

220
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,109
on!

221
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,912
Stick the meat and making it bigger

222
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,881
from the bottom towards the end.

223
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,315
Do you know why?

224
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,051
- No.
- Using perspective,

225
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,587
they will all look to be about
the same size.

226
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,989
Petty, right?

227
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,828
Hey, who made this?

228
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,296
- Me.
- Anything wrong?

229
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,098
Nakamori.

230
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,401
How many millimeter is the length of
spring onion for making Negima?

231
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,069
- Well...
- 25 mm.

232
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,439
Long. Short. Short.
Long, Super long! Redo it!

233
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,009
Shop manager, I will
introduce to you the area manager.

234
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,445
How is the inventory?

235
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,716
Eh?

236
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:40,687
This is my first day here, so...

237
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,922
I am talking about
today's inventory.

238
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,390
Did I say anything about yesterday?

239
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,026
I see. Well...

240
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,328
- I will do that from now.
- How about the sales report?

241
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,564
- Today's report?
- We have not even opened yet.

242
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,898
Of course I mean yesterday's report.

243
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,300
Because I was not here...

244
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,969
So you do not care about the
sales on days you are not here?

245
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,003
No.

246
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,338
Knowing the status of the shop,

247
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,240
solving problems
and bringing results,

248
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,908
these are your duties for sure.
If you cannot do this,

249
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,744
then it is meaningless to
send the staff to the shop.

250
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,346
Sakama is good at sales, right?

251
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,849
I'm not good,
but yes, I am from sales.

252
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,018
The sales department is directly
connected to the end shops.

253
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,388
The result of sales will be
reflected from the end shops.

254
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,825
If the result of end shops are bad,
it is the responsibility of sales.

255
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,726
I got it.

256
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,300
How about in the field
of the internet?

257
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,603
I have some confidence in it.

258
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,006
- Like Facebook?
- Yes.

259
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,008
You have a lot
of internship experiences.

260
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,010
Yes, about ten companies.

261
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,179
- Mass communications?
- And advertisement-related.

262
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,816
- How about publication companies?
- Yes, I have been there.

263
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,986
- The time is up.
- Thank you.

264
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,261
Excuse me.

265
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,767
She values herself too highly.

266
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,004
It was so obvious that
she speaking herself highly.

267
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,505
The way she speak
is also irritating.

268
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,307
There's not an interesting person.

269
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,644
In the past, there was an idiot who
broke roof tiles with his head.

270
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,713
But well,

271
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,782
that is because she is a Yutori.

272
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,018
In contrary, Shimoyama,

273
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,786
although she is not the type
that could answer smartly,

274
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,489
she listens to the lecture
well and could comprehend it.

275
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,057
I see.

276
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,893
It's important to call out
and correct kids,

277
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,029
like Nomura and Mori,

278
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,031
who make simple mistakes
in tests and handouts.

279
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,899
That too, I see.

280
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,135
Only correcting the mistake
they made...

281
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,202
would not make the kids grow.

282
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,971
It is also boring
to teach like this, right?

283
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,241
What could the teacher feel from
the wrong answer?

284
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,575
What could he learn?

285
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,610
You might call it a thrill,

286
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,645
or what makes it worth doing,
therefore...

287
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,516
I see...

288
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,185
- Eh?
- Eh?

289
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,221
- Sorry.
- Eh? Eh?

290
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,857
- No, no.
- Sakura sensei?

291
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,360
Well, no,

292
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,429
Why did I become like this?

293
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,898
What happened?

294
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,900
Yamaji sensei, what have you done?

295
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,802
No, not me...
Was that because of me?

296
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,805
I am fine.

297
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,010
Somehow, I felt so overwhelm.

298
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,647
I could not carrying out
the class according to my plan.

299
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,717
Just when I was feeling all pent up,

300
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,652
Yamaji sensei suddenly told me
so many things...

301
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,220
Did I say that much?

302
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,556
- Did I that that much to you?
- Isn't that it?

303
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,558
Isn't this power harassment?

304
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,595
(Torinotami)

305
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,031
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

306
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,034
Hey, Nakamori!
How are the six Negima?

307
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,402
Ah, it burned.

308
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,270
- The sauce...
- That should be salt, all of them!

309
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,272
- Look at it properly, Nakamori!
- Sorry.

310
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,944
- What are you doing?
- Sorry...

311
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,547
- I will change the sauce to salt.
- I beg you not to do anything.

312
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,649
The jumbo tsukune looks tasty.

313
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,319
Sorry to keep you waiting.

314
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,054
Yes.

315
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,723
- Thank you.
- Pass this.

316
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,426
Sorry, at this crowded moment.

317
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,394
It is fine.

318
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,995
Don't you feel cold?

319
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,264
Can you turn down the air-con?

320
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,700
- And then, the yakitori...
- Let's order a lot of them.

321
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,468
Because today is
Yamaji sensei's treat.

322
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,138
It's nothing,
because I have vouchers.

323
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:22,809
Then, I will consolidate the order.
Who wants the jumbo tsukune?

324
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,511
- Here.
- Here.

325
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,312
Then it will be everyone.

326
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,683
It will be two
sticks per sheet, right?

327
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,185
Sorry. Here.

328
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,822
- That's only for the first drink.
- Is that so?

329
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,190
Of course!

330
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,059
We will be in deficit if we gave
2 sticks for additional drinks.

331
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,228
- Did you say anything, Nakamori?
- Sorry!

332
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,365
Also, the jumbo tsukune is
not included in the voucher.

333
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,102
- Sorry. And the air-con...
- No way.

334
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,770
The temperature has been pre-fixed.

335
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,506
- I see.
- In short,

336
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,742
there is a nation-wide experiment.

337
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,310
No cramming.

338
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,078
No indiscriminate memorizing.

339
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,849
Is 3 okay for Pi?

340
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,219
The learning ability of the kids
decrease when it was applied.

341
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,787
Experiment failed.

342
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,723
Withdraw!
Right, vice principal?

343
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:14,060
Does that mean that we
were part of an experiment?

344
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,562
Hey!

345
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,431
- Sorry!
- Sorry!

346
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,433
- Sorry.
- In the first place, Sakura,

347
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,468
- Yes.
- You,

348
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,903
have never been
scolded before, right?

349
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,505
Of course I have.

350
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,641
Yamaji sensei
made you cried today, didn't he?

351
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,844
- Eh?
- I feel cold.

352
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,512
The air-con is too strong.

353
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,814
Tell your friend.

354
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,616
Yes.

355
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,986
Because I am hated by Yamaji sensei.

356
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,155
There is no such thing.

357
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,557
It is fine. I am not honest,

358
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,159
and I cannot comprehend well too.

359
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,695
- Did you say that?
- No...!

360
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,030
I might became a bit too emotional.

361
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,099
But that is,

362
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,069
because it's my first time
mentoring.

363
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,905
- I don't hate you at all, really.
- Then, do you like her?

364
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,140
Like... like?

365
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:04,277
- So, you dislike me.
- No, no...

366
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,047
Sorry!

367
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,887
The discounted portion from
the group just now,

368
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,524
the wasted food,
the broken mug and plates.

369
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,660
There you go,

370
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,730
20,000 Yen.

371
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,366
Sorry, this sounds
like we conned you.

372
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,401
That is the regulation
of the company,

373
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,636
is that right, Nakamori?

374
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,640
Please lock the door.

375
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,009
Thank you for your hard work.

376
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,726
Sakama.

377
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,533
Are you alright?

378
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,805
Well... somehow...

379
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,974
It is was really cheap.

380
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:11,077
It is definitely weird if the meal
of six persons is under 20,000 yen.

381
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,013
Can you stand up?

382
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,282
Me too.

383
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,452
I am just like that
female college student.

384
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,221
I have never been scolded before.

385
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,258
- Do you want to stand up?
- Ah.

386
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,260
You saw that right?
The part-time work leader.

387
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,763
Even though I had failed,
he only scolded the young man.

388
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,032
Even though they were my mistakes.

389
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,400
No,

390
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,402
because you are
transferred from the head office.

391
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,870
In the first place,

392
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,773
nothing was expected
from me and I was not needed.

393
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,141
That's why I'm looked down on...

394
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,111
It is better not to stand up.

395
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,014
There's no way a human who
has never been scolded,

396
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,650
could scold his subordinates.

397
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,387
Here, sorry.

398
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,228
In the past,

399
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,698
I did fairly well
in study and sports.

400
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,902
The teacher was stuck working on
the kids who could not do as well.

401
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,805
Also, my parents kept saying,

402
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,743
"you have it easier than your elder
brother and younger sister".

403
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,480
That was dangerous. Are you alright?

404
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,815
- Hey...
- Yes.

405
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,450
Just now,

406
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,387
I was giving a self-introduction
in a casual manner.

407
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,524
But by generation,
there's that right?

408
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,693
Starting from the third year of
junior high,

409
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,894
there was the 5 day week,

410
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,897
- 5 level assessment and ranking...
- I'm pressure-free person!

411
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,066
Me too.

412
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,036
Though I was not conscious
of it at all.

413
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,905
Me too. I still went to
tuition on weekends.

414
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,774
You went there.

415
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,443
But I am in the common
ranking at the tuition center.

416
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,613
We were told that we are defective
items from the Ministry of Education

417
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,049
Wow, are you alright?

418
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,950
Got into a college,

419
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,153
I thought I would find a good job.

420
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,389
- Salaryman shock.
- Salaryman shock!

421
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:07,894
It became ice age suddenly!
What was that about!

422
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,531
I have never felt the life
of a pressure-free person.

423
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,399
Sakama!

424
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,468
Sakama!

425
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,570
This is dangerous.

426
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,006
Sorry, can I have some water?

427
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,812
You can't drink.

428
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,514
My body does not allow me to drink.

429
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,717
- Eh?
- Let's go to one more shop!

430
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,486
- Get a lady?
- Let's go home.

431
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,254
Isn't now the time to find a lady?

432
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,658
This time is my turn
to get accompanied.

433
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,193
Have you ever listened to my story?

434
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,363
They told me it is
alright not to get number one.

435
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,100
You listened to that willfully.

436
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,634
Indeed.

437
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,771
If compared with my friends who got
there in the same year with me,

438
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:13,960
Yamaji.

439
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,395
Let's go to get a lady of
pressure-free generation.

440
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,630
Please leave me alone.

441
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:18,564
Eh.

442
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,237
Yama... Am I wrong?

443
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,806
You are really Yama.

444
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:30,309
I am Kobayashi from Fukushima.

445
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,846
Kobayashi of Kooriyama,
do you remember me?

446
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,783
Although we were
not in the same class,

447
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:37,984
Yama for sure,

448
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,586
joined the skiing club, right?

449
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,523
- Is that so?
- Yes, three years in junior high.

450
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:49,362
Ah, the one at the ski lodging...

451
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,465
Now you remember?

452
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,468
- I miss that time.
- It was a long time...

453
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,969
That is enough.

454
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:01,073
No way, I cannot
take Yama to such a place.

455
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,017
V I... V I...
That is alright.

456
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,719
Remember my face.

457
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,523
Turn at that corner, go to
the sixth floor of the building.

458
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,692
I shall go up there first,
I will be waiting for you.

459
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,361
Really?

460
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,531
Make yourself look good!

461
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,500
Yama!

462
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,572
You are from Fukushima, Yama.

463
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,407
Yes, until 18 years old.

464
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,009
After the teaching license exam,
there was an earthquake.

465
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,611
I went there too.

466
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,213
A food manufacturing
factory at Miyagi.

467
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,848
To support the reconstruction.

468
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,886
But at my second
year in that company,

469
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,155
I didn't perform well.

470
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,257
I felt sorry for myself.

471
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,695
During the recession,
the 3.11 incident happened

472
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,730
we were just about
to enter the work force.

473
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,473
Your friend is late.
It is 2 am already.

474
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,208
Seems that he is not my friend.

475
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,281
I confirmed with
my local friend via LINE.

476
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:17,884
Who is that?

477
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,585
Kobayashi? I do not know him.

478
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,920
That is dangerous.

479
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,488
This is super suspicious!

480
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,557
What is this! Eh?

481
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,359
But you have hugged him
like you miss him so much.

482
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,562
Sorry, he called me with
my name in junior high, so...

483
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,264
The words match at that time.

484
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,016
We are deceived!

485
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,394
How much do you have?

486
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:02,895
Are you going to pay?

487
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,508
But it costs 120,000 Yen for
one beer and jasmine tea.

488
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,116
If we cause trouble here,
the school might know.

489
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,986
Stop messing around, Yama.

490
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,756
You were the one kept
saying about getting lady.

491
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,626
No way, it is not enough at all.

492
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,430
Only this much?

493
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,184
Ah, the receipt?

494
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,353
Idiot...

495
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,022
Akane!

496
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:41,627
Wait for me, Akane.

497
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,095
Akane, wait for me!

498
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:45,765
Hey.

499
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,135
Where is your friend?

500
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,639
He will stay at the comic
coffee shop,

501
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,141
he is a primary school teacher.

502
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,144
By the way,

503
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,047
why did you change the number?

504
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:04,150
Hah? You should apologize first.

505
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,890
- Sorry.
- For what?

506
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,392
Eh, well...

507
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,130
I will reimburse you on
the day of receiving salary.

508
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,434
Recently I am thinking what if
we are not the same company.

509
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,638
Only meet when we want to,

510
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,807
and hide
when we do not want to.

511
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,376
quarrel about the job,

512
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,011
half of that is a lie.

513
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,680
But, it is alright because
it is the matter of other persons.

514
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:38,017
Somehow we cannot
take the same day off.

515
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,152
Like a normal couple.

516
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,489
I feel suffocated.

517
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,357
I want to stop.

518
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,029
I should be the one to call it off.

519
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,298
- Why?
- Because...

520
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,433
you have been promoted
to area manager.

521
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,835
You have big expectation and duty.

522
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,071
What is that? Opinion
from whose perspective?

523
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,209
Sorry.

524
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,644
I got promoted

525
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,646
and got to a higher level
in the company.

526
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,217
It has shaken our relationship,
and I don't like that.

527
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,059
Sorry. Sorry.

528
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,563
Because I like you.

529
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:30,136
So I do not want to
get immersed into job and love.

530
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,146
If that is the case...

531
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,981
- What?
- Eh?

532
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,183
Wait.

533
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,587
- I know what you want to say.
- Me?

534
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,556
If that is the case,
I really dislike that.

535
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,925
That is not the case.

536
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:56,629
Let's get married.

537
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,965
- That is what I mean.
- Seriously?

538
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,403
Why now?
At a time like this?

539
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:08,107
I don't get it...

540
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,609
I know.

541
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,045
We are hurt anyway,

542
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,381
so you propose desperately,
even though you are rejected.

543
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,883
Do you know who
or why are you hurt?

544
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,753
That is not the case.

545
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:22,488
Well.

546
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,424
Indeed, today I am exhausted.

547
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,961
I am not happy even
you have propose me.

548
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,062
I see.

549
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,335
He is not coming?

550
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,605
Of course we are exchanging mail.

551
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:43,209
Though we also received
the sample of the new products.

552
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,778
But only that.

553
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:49,215
Afterwards, he did not even
ask about how things are.

554
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,317
Yamagiwa?

555
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,486
Is he into this job?

556
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:55,654
He is Yamagishi.

557
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:57,923
Not even once
after I hand over to him?

558
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:01,527
Yes. Sakama comes even though
you have nothing in need.

559
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,267
- I like the fried chicken rice box.
- Well, you have been helping me.

560
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,135
Do you want some?

561
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:12,438
Yes, I want.

562
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,008
- Glad you want some. Here you go.
- Thank you.

563
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:20,179
We are a small company
and we cannot order as much.

564
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,550
I can't say you are trying
to please the customers.

565
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,851
But,

566
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,153
remember the faces.

567
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,156
You take the time to have meal
and chat with us.

568
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,360
If that is the case,
do you want to buy some?

569
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,098
Is that what sales does?

570
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,500
This kind of thought,

571
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,103
maybe old-fashioned.

572
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,775
There is strength that does not
match with the face.

573
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,812
In reverse, the one who contact
frequently, and fawn,

574
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:56,015
giving strong feeling of
his wish to complete quota,

575
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,819
is pathetic, and people's
impression on him will turn worse.

576
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,024
But, they do not even
remember your name.

577
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,859
Hey, seriously,

578
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,694
I send
sales email to them every day.

579
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,429
That was an email for all, right?

580
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,432
If you type the mail one by one, you
will not have time for your own.

581
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,967
Please leave me alone.

582
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,902
But having so, you will
not win other companies.

583
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:17,936
Perhaps I should say,

584
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,339
I do not want to do useless job.

585
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,141
Eh? What?

586
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,543
Although it is useless, keep
going back to the customers,

587
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:25,878
it is a useless job, right?

588
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:32,084
You do not need to fawn if you have
confidence on your own products.

589
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,720
Having time for the seniority,

590
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,355
how about leap in?

591
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,557
Isn't that good to
open up new rules bravely?

592
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,532
- May be that is right. But...
- What do you come here for?

593
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,468
If you are
concerned with my problem,

594
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,905
I am grateful. But somehow,

595
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,140
it feels like you are
doing private inquiry.

596
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:56,976
I feel bad.

597
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,545
You said private inquiry.

598
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,780
It is hard, right?

599
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,783
If you do too much preaching.

600
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:08,654
It will be power harassment,
or moral harassment in this era.

601
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:12,024
The pressure-free persons who think
like this are spoil by Heisei-born.

602
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,125
- If you were me...
- Welcome.

603
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,193
The usual.

604
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,398
How about my position that has been
away from that useless job.

605
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,338
It appears.

606
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,440
He updated
Facebook during our talk.

607
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,346
"From a gentle senior,

608
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,615
I receive words
that make me grateful.

609
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,851
I am awakened. Thank you.

610
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,720
That was lunch time

611
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,589
at Harajuku."

612
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:51,897
Welcome home.

613
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,767
I am back.

614
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,135
Do you think I am crying?

615
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,070
Eh?

616
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,239
I am eating Yakisoba.

617
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,208
At this hour?

618
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:07,146
- Where is elder brother?
- He's ou.

619
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,114
The invitation for sample testing.

620
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:11,350
There are so many memos of absence.

621
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,253
There is nothing we can do.

622
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,589
- It just past 49 days.
- That is not the case.

623
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:21,059
After all, they were all
your father's customers.

624
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,529
The network which your
father had built in his own.

625
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,765
Talking about the craftsman,

626
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,334
although that comes to Munetaka,

627
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,572
without the backing called as
father, how will things turn into?

628
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,444
How about you?

629
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,679
You have not talked
about your work recently.

630
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,649
I will tell you when
things become clearer.

631
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,685
You and your temper.

632
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,023
A lot of things happened.

633
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:55,227
I am in a vortex
of a big company.

634
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:04,436
I will eat.

635
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,805
I will eat...

636
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,975
Sorry.

637
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:15,948
It tastes good?

638
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,185
Sorry.

639
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,088
I could not find
Yamagishi, so I call you.

640
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,923
I ordered last week.

641
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:28,193
170 kg of frozen chicken
leg for fried chicken.

642
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,395
It has not been delivered yet.

643
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,698
Is that so? I am sorry.

644
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:36,101
No, you have no
responsibility on this.

645
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:40,072
- This happened frequently.
- I see.

646
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,075
This is not the first time for him.

647
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,445
Who wrote this?

648
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,982
- Good morning.
- We are Torinotami.

649
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:52,985
- What is this? Toriminzoku.
- I am sorry.

650
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:57,489
- Correct that.
- Ok.

651
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,558
I will report this
to the head office. Yes.

652
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,860
What are you doing?

653
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,930
It seems to be a mistake
of order at the head office.

654
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,265
Now seems that someone
is coming to collect this.

655
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,267
Wait, not that we
have the spare ones.

656
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,501
Who is the person in charge?

657
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,938
Give me a break.

658
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,340
Sorry, what's your name?

659
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,345
Sales department at
head office, Yamagishi.

660
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:22,714
May I?

661
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,783
Senior, I did it.

662
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:29,154
Mistake in taking order.
Lucky that I realized it early.

663
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:32,357
The delivery truck
will return to collect it.

664
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,228
Eh? What is that?

665
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,297
You should come and collect it.

666
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,098
Eh.

667
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,067
No, impossible.

668
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,802
I also have my arrangement...

669
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,404
Fine, just come.

670
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,140
- Eh, where is that?
- Kouenji

671
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,777
- You must be kidding.
- Your way of speaking!

672
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,845
Things become like this
because of your mistake.

673
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:54,880
Sorry!

674
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,649
- Sorry.
- It should not be sorry.

675
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:00,686
Take this, and come with me.
I will let you do the useless job.

676
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,557
- Come over here!
- Yes!

677
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,630
Too bad, it is already too late.

678
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,132
The menu has been changed.

679
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,139
I am sorry.

680
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,009
That's why,
you should come by train.

681
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,980
- It melts, right?
- Sorry.

682
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,781
Two of these cannot be used.

683
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,017
The remaining ones
will be deliver by freezer truck.

684
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,224
- Why are you crying?
- Sorry.

685
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,861
Because of my fault.

686
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,098
My...!

687
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,673
Don't kneel, it is meaningless.

688
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,843
If you make the floor dirty,
it will be the problem of hygiene.

689
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,711
Well, in this case...

690
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,048
Put on this.

691
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,519
I am sorry.

692
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:11,156
Like you said, maybe we can catch
the time with arrangement via phone.

693
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,025
What are you saying?

694
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,926
I am happy that you come.

695
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:20,132
Factory like this, people like this,
doing rice-box like this.

696
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,836
For the elders who stay alone, for
caregiving institution,

697
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,439
or for nursery.

698
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:30,308
You will not understand
without seeing this directly.

699
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,146
The severity of your mistake,

700
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,115
you will never know
this via phone or email.

701
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,552
Yamagishi,

702
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:44,156
starting from now,
show up more often.

703
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,128
Senior.

704
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:53,899
Today.

705
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,134
Thank you.

706
00:38:58,437 --> 00:38:59,771
I...

707
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:03,542
...have just entered
this company for 2 years.

708
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,312
This is the first time
I am properly scolded.

709
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:21,460
That's why you are
a pressure-free person.

710
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,733
In short, it is not about
talking or scolding.

711
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,569
It is about the heart.

712
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,504
Because power harassment is scary,
you cannot do staff training.

713
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,306
Because he is not an idiot,

714
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,108
you can run into emotion,

715
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,677
- and deliver this feeling directly.
- This is too much.

716
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:42,981
- Your pace is too fast.
- You want ice with it?

717
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,219
Yama, you have an annoying vibe.

718
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:50,722
- Eh?
- And you are grinning.

719
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,991
Something I should ask?

720
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,292
Someone confessed her feeling to me.

721
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:55,560
I have not even asked.

722
00:39:56,862 --> 00:40:02,667
Through this internship,
I realize about my feeling.

723
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:08,406
Of course, as a teacher,
I should be firm...

724
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,777
I also...

725
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,183
- like you.
- That is not good.

726
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,317
That is not good?

727
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,053
Are you going to
date a college student?

728
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,890
The formality will remain
until the end of the internship.

729
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,792
What is this becoming?
You are nasty.

730
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,127
Deterioration of education.
I want more ice.

731
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,096
- Ice.
- OK...

732
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,598
Sakama, you also get
your girlfriend back.

733
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,967
No, now is the delicate period
of time.

734
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,137
Sorry.

735
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:45,310
I am getting irritated.
I want to hit someone.

736
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,655
Rather than that,

737
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,225
I am a feminist.

738
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,961
In the first place,
before the public,

739
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,763
what do you
mean by yelling "lady", "lady?

740
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,268
If there is someone
getting irritated,

741
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,337
there will also
be someone getting angry.

742
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:48,640
The angry one will
not come from Kouenji.

743
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,909
Idiot! That's why you
are a pressure-free person.

744
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,616
What's up?

745
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,953
What are you looking at?
Any problem?

746
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,227
Money...

747
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,897
- Yes?
- Please give our money back.

748
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,934
Please give our money back.
The 120,000 Yen.

749
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,402
Money, 120,000 Yen.
Money, 120,000 Yen.

750
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,037
Don't get so loud.

751
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,305
Sorry.

752
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,307
I only introduced the shop to you.

753
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,277
You are the one who paid the money.

754
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,746
Isn't that your own responsibility?

755
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,616
You are not kid anyway.

756
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,354
What is it?

757
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:41,026
Why do you stand there?

758
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,727
I will beat you up.

759
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,865
I...

760
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,868
Please come to my shop.

761
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,571
Because I have
gone to your shop too.

762
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,074
100 sheets of voucher.

763
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,044
Please come until you spend it all.

764
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:03,481
I will forget the 120,000 Yen.

765
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,199
Sakama.

766
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,235
I can't, I can't hit him.

767
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,071
We have tried hard.

768
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:30,909
Yutori, Masakazu,
I will take you to the station.

769
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:36,614
Good morning.

770
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,286
Masa, your tie?
It is fine to be like this in shop.

771
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:51,529
- Yutori, breakfast?
- I have no time.

772
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,365
- Midori, can you make some onigiri.
- OK.

773
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,735
Do it yourself.
Midori is not your maid.

774
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:02,574
I wrote down some points
regarding the lecture yesterday.

775
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:06,378
You specially did that for
me after you went home?

776
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,947
- It is my job.
- I am happy.

777
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,483
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

778
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:14,119
Good morning.

779
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:18,523
Good morning.

780
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,983
I am leaving.

781
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:48,086
Sorry, I am on my brother's car.

782
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,320
Good morning, what happened?

783
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:52,223
Yamagishi at sales department
was Sakama's subordinate, right?

784
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,993
Yes, when I was still
in sales department.

785
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:58,163
He seemed to have
a problem with Sakama yesterday.

786
00:44:58,296 --> 00:44:59,664
Not a problem...

787
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,368
Does he make mistake again?

788
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:05,770
He has resigned from the company.

789
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,642
He sent a message to all superiors
and colleagues this morning.

790
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,043
Did you get it?

791
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,847
I will resign.

792
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,752
I will die. I better die rather than
working with that superior.

793
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,786
Somehow.

794
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,190
This is the first time
I am scolded properly.

795
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,793
Are you kidding, Yamagishi?

796
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,029
Attention please
all passengers.

797
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:35,533
Right now, as there is an incident
at Musashikokubunji Station...

798
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,002
Seems to be a salaryman who
jumped to the rail.

799
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,004
Give me a break.

800
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,084
Jump. suicide?

801
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:57,021
Male, in his early twenty.

802
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,792
Yamagishi is dead.

803
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:02,627
- What?
- Really?

804
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,195
I am sorry.

805
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,630
Listen.

806
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,998
I am here.

807
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,666
We are here for you.

808
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,201
Maribu.

809
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:11,436
Your friend.

810
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,004
No, we are not...
