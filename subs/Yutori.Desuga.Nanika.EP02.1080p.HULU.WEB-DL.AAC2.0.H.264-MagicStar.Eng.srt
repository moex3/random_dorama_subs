1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:03,404
Yamagishi from Sales Dept. was
Mr. Sakama's subordinate, right?

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,572
He said he's going to resign.

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,174
- "Suicide?"
- "Male in his early 20's."

4
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:08,843
"Oh, he's alive!"

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,645
Big bro! Big bro!

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,448
- I'm sorry about that.
- What's wrong?

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,550
Hey, Bro!

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,387
We apologize for the inconvenience.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,422
Due to an accident involving
human casualties

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,158
the operation
is currently suspended.

11
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,862
(Notice)

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,368
Excuse me, where's
the man who jumped off?

13
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,670
- Do you know each other?
- He's my subordinate.

14
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,172
No, I mean there's a possiblity.

15
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,740
He was taken to the hospital.

16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:05,800
(We're Millennials, Got A Problem)

17
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,103
"I'm going to resign
from the company."

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,404
"Thank you very much. Seriously!"

19
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,741
"I'll die! Working with such
superior will put me to death."

20
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,310
Hey! Where's Yamagishi's table?

21
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,446
It's here.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,516
The computer provided by
the company was left in the office.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,819
The data inside was erased.

24
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,687
But why use LINE out of all?

25
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,223
For argument's sake,
he could have sent email or--

26
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,691
No! There was not even an email!

27
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:31,692
(Surgery in progress)

28
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,231
Are you a relative?

29
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,599
Well...

30
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,201
What is it?
Were you able to identify?

31
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,703
No, not yet. The person over here...

32
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,638
I have not been able to contact
my subordinate since this morning.

33
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,174
Please go inside and verify.

34
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,442
No.

35
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,911
- Come on. Don't say "no."
- No, I can't do it. I'm sorry.

36
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,213
Doc.

37
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,484
Were you able to identify?

38
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,053
Here's a family of the deceased.
It's the mother.

39
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,589
Unfortunately, just a while ago...

40
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,657
Please go inside and verify.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,286
Finally, I'm able to reach you!

42
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,755
Is it okay to talk to you now?

43
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,024
Huh?

44
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:38,893
Are you crying?

45
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,595
Yamaji is dead.

46
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,531
What should I do?

47
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,466
What? Who?

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,434
My subordinate in the company.

49
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,436
The guy in his second year.
I mentioned about him last time.

50
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,106
The guy you gave sermon
for the first time?

51
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,909
That's right.
Yamagishi from the Sales Dept.

52
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,744
He jumped in front of a train
and died just now at the hospital.

53
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,947
What? Sorry, hold on a second.

54
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,883
Sorry about that. Come again?
Was it on the news?

55
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,053
That's right. That's Yamagishi
from our company.

56
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,721
Oh no, what should I do?

57
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,656
Are you sure?

58
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,324
He's dead. If he were alive
they wouldn't say

59
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,725
"Are you a family of the deceased?"

60
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,260
That's not what I mean.

61
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,095
Could it be someone else?

62
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,730
It's Yamaji!

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,399
Really? Did you verify it?

64
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,035
Someone who looked like his
mother is verifying now though.

65
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,103
It must be Yamaji

66
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,006
'cause he's a salaried man
in his early 20's.

67
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,142
I can't even reach his mobile phone.

68
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,512
'Cause it was quite out of his
character to do such a thing.

69
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,847
Yamagishi, what should I do?

70
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,320
- What?
- Yamaji.

71
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,220
What did I just say?

72
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,057
Well, sometimes you said
"Yamagishi." Sometimes "Yamaji."

73
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,392
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,428
It's okay. Yeah, I thought
you were confused.

75
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,263
Why didn't you say that, Yama...

76
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,931
Yamaji.

77
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,633
Yamaji.

78
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,102
You kow what, let's calm down.

79
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,971
Well... We still don't know
if it's Yamaji--

80
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,907
I mean we don't know yet
if it's really Yamagishi or not.

81
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,976
- Sorry, I've got an incoming call.
- What?

82
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,078
We found Yamagishi.

83
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,012
What?

84
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,715
He updated his Facebook account
just a while ago.

85
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,452
It says that he's at an aquarium
watching the arowana cozily.

86
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,220
- Shall we "like" it?
- What?

87
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,031
Excuse me. He's an office mate
of your son.

88
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,400
- No, I mean--
- I'm sorry.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,237
Hiroyuki has caused so much trouble.

90
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,572
No. Well... Actually, Im--

91
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,174
He used to say that he
enjoyed his work so much.

92
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,676
He said that to have no day off

93
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,712
was proof that he was needed
in the company.

94
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,281
Come to think about it,

95
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,684
he didn't want us, his parents,
to worry about him.

96
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,620
He was such a loving son.

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,756
- Madam.
- Are you his mother?

98
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,725
I'm Hidaka from
Sunshine Trading Company.

99
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,761
With regards to your son,

100
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,196
please accept
our sincere condolences.

101
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,533
Likewise, I'm Eguchi,
Promotion Division Manager.

102
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,636
This is Attorney Takahashi,
our corporate lawyer

103
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,338
and the person in charge of
your son's insurance--

104
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,907
I'm Ishibashi from Sontoku Japan.

105
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,509
My condolences.

106
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,078
The incident this time is truly...

107
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,880
I felt sorry...

108
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,048
for the mother.

109
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,452
She hasn't sorted out her feelings,
yet people came one after another.

110
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,223
I guess there's a manual...

111
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,193
on how to handle matters when
an employee commits suicide.

112
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,228
It was super sweatshop.

113
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,399
But good for you
it wasn't Yamagishi.

114
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,769
I'm sorry. That was inappropriate.

115
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,642
Same here. Sorry for calling you
by the wrong name.

116
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,714
Honestly speaking, I felt relieved.

117
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,617
Since we're not related,

118
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,654
all the more I was able to be
objective. How should I put it?

119
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,991
It was like watching a play
titled...

120
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,494
"If your subordinate
commits suicide."

121
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,229
We'd like to start inquiring
immediately into the matter

122
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,467
whether there were any demand for
harsh labor, excessive instructions

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,303
and power harassment.

124
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,272
Then, we shall report
the result to you.

125
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,273
After that...

126
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,610
I think the guy named Goto who was
standing absent-mindedly

127
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,480
and gave me his name card

128
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,281
is his direct superior.

129
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:25,219
Well, I think it was someone who
was in my position for Yamagishi.

130
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,856
The reason why I thought
that way was because...

131
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,658
he was the only one...

132
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,495
crying.

133
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,465
If you think about it, the big shots
and lawyers who were bowing

134
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,069
don't know anything about
the guy who committed suicide.

135
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,639
That's why they could talk about
money in a businesslike manner.

136
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,108
Anyway...

137
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,010
when I imagined that
it could have been my role

138
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,013
I'm really glad that the one
who died was not Yamagishi.

139
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,650
Having felt that...

140
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,486
I was relieved, but...

141
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,224
I also felt a sense of guilt.

142
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,662
Somehow it was unbearable.

143
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,238
By the way,
did you call this morning?

144
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,607
Oh yeah, that's right.

145
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,410
I came across that guy.
The pimp in Koenji.

146
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,411
The pimp who lures you
to get ladies?

147
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,780
That's right. Believe it or not...

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,649
Who do you think he was with?

149
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,926
You mean he also uses
Uncle-For-Rent?

150
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,094
Is there such a coincidence?

151
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,230
Well, our case was
a coincidence though.

152
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,865
Then, I thought about it.

153
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,034
The pimp who calls himself Kobayashi

154
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,036
called me "Yama," right?

155
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,270
Yama, as far as I can remember.

156
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,339
You were at a ski club, right?

157
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,441
The high school you graduated from
and ski lessons you took

158
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,709
are personal information, right?

159
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,245
I wonder where such
information leaked out.

160
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,080
And the person that came to mind
was...

161
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,582
Mr. Aso.

162
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,483
Weren't you asked to fill out
your profile at your first meeting?

163
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,651
Yes, I was asked to fill it out.

164
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,688
I also talked about my addiction to
ski during my high school years.

165
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,456
I remember Mr. Aso was taking notes.

166
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,692
Hold on a second.
You mean the two are accomplice?

167
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,527
Or...

168
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,063
they buy and sell information
for certain purposes.

169
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,664
That's impossible!

170
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,566
I can't think of anything else.

171
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,069
It's true, I didn't tell anyone,
not even my co-teachers.

172
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,370
No matter how you think about it,
there's no one else, but him.

173
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,405
A lady for you, Mister.

174
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,675
Don't you want a lady tonight?

175
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,646
Oh dear, this way goes to the ladies
Would you like to get one?

176
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,649
Bro! Bro!

177
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,084
There you go!

178
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,422
I'm terribly sorry!

179
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,857
No, no, no.

180
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,692
- What? Parent and child?
- It can't be true.

181
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,294
Well...

182
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,996
When he entered senior high school,

183
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,164
I got a divorce.

184
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,834
Since then, I haven't
lived with him.

185
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,336
He only comes to me
for allowance sometimes.

186
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,039
You mean he sneaked a look at my
personal information on his way?

187
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,375
Most probably. Well...

188
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:05,279
When we met last time, in fact...

189
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,614
he was there.

190
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,883
Once they lose in a relay,
they'd say it's my fault

191
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,919
even if they said it's okay
not to be number one.

192
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,655
Since you're a regular customer,
Mr. Yamaji,

193
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:18,325
when you had a near miss
with my son...

194
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,962
How should I put it? He thought
it'd be easy to deceive you.

195
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,864
And so I think he had an eye on you.

196
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm terribly sorry!

197
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,670
Please accept this.

198
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,206
Please tell us more in details.

199
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,341
About my son?

200
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,542
About yourself too, Mr. Aso.

201
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,611
- Is that so?
- Are you fooling around?

202
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,480
No, of course not.

203
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,249
Well...

204
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,652
first of all...

205
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,991
Aso is...

206
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,027
a fake name.

207
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,130
My real name is Michigami.

208
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,899
Originally, I run
a real estate business.

209
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,400
During the heyday of
the bubble economy when I was 30,

210
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,401
I put up the company.

211
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,303
Now...

212
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,274
by using that experience,

213
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,609
I'm registered as "Uncle-For-Rent"
on top of my normal job

214
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,511
as a freelance corporate advisor.

215
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,879
You're comfortably free
from worldly cares, huh?

216
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,650
- Not really.
- What about your son?

217
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:22,089
Maribu Michigami, just like you two,
was born in 1987.

218
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,324
He's a first generation millennial.

219
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:28,161
When he was in high school,
he was called a prodigy.

220
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,997
He passed first on the list
on the entrance exam

221
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,298
at a prestigious private school.

222
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,734
It's just that ever since
the divorce,

223
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,838
my wife's unreasonable expectation

224
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,274
had caused too much pressure on him.

225
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:42,676
Is he the only child?

226
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,111
Yes. No. Yes.

227
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,612
Is it yes or no?

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,914
It's such a shame,

229
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,817
but I got married again.

230
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,128
That's young.

231
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,363
Yes, he was only two years old.

232
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,065
I was referring to your wife.

233
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,300
Ah, this one.

234
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,936
As I've expected,
she was born in 1987...

235
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,739
- A millennial.
- First generation.

236
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:17,277
I decided to name my son Maui.

237
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,481
It was the place...

238
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,484
where I first met my wife.

239
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,454
It was a memorable place.

240
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,127
Anyway...

241
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,529
this one.

242
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,898
Please don't say anything
and just accept it.

243
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,902
It's illogical to ask the parent to
make up for the mistake of his son.

244
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,336
Besides, he's not a kid anymore.

245
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,439
I'll settle this matter on my own.

246
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,740
Please give me your son's contact.

247
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,675
I can't disclose
such personal information.

248
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,644
Are you still protecting that guy?

249
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,213
If you're the parent, why don't you
give that scum a good scolding?

250
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,815
- Mr. Sakama.
- He's scum, right?

251
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,417
Myself, Yama and your son too!

252
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,418
No, 'cause...

253
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,953
But everyone is different.

254
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,255
We're all scum, but each of us
are different scums.

255
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,357
Don't use the one word
"millennials" to refer to all.

256
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,827
If you have time to earn extra money
by giving advice to young people

257
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,061
and feel that you understand them,

258
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,697
why don't you at least
scold your son properly?

259
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,073
Excuse me,
I've got other things to do.

260
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,813
You're late!

261
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:27,781
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,117
- You wouldn't mind a coffee, right?
- It's fine.

263
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,651
Was it your first time to receive

264
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,320
a wrong order yesterday?

265
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,088
No.

266
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,492
There were several times
before that.

267
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,298
It's for recording purposes.
Please continue.

268
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,244
Everyone makes mistakes.

269
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,647
The thing I found questionable
was...

270
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,285
Yamagishi's attitude as a salesman.

271
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,853
I don't want to do dirty work.

272
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,655
Huh? Dirty what? Come again?

273
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,125
To make rounds of customers for
the hell of it is dirty work, right?

274
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,660
That's terrible.

275
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,295
Here you go.

276
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,330
The problem is...

277
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,500
no one tries to call his attention.

278
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,703
I mean, no one educate
nor can educate him.

279
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,039
I thought that such mood
is not good for him.

280
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,275
Do you really think so?

281
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,778
Didn't you unilaterally
attack on impulse?

282
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,281
Watch your mouth!

283
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,449
Because of your mistakes,
this is happening!

284
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,885
At that time...

285
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:42,856
Yes.

286
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,425
But I thought...

287
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,128
he wouldn't notice the seriousness
of the matter unless it's enforced.

288
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,697
Bow your head together.

289
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,633
It feels like I was scolded
properly for the first time.

290
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,671
Then, "I'll resign from the company"
"Jekyll and Hyde".

291
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:01,441
Then, on LINE he said "Working with
such supeior will put me to death."

292
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,276
We're also millennials...

293
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,479
but there were still scary seniors
who guided us strictly.

294
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,248
Our generation is on the borderline.

295
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,251
But in their case,
they've never been scolded.

296
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,020
I mean they only learned
ways not to be scolded.

297
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,156
That's why it's the end
once they get scolded.

298
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,091
Is that a bash against
the next generation?

299
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,359
No, that's not what I mean.

300
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,994
You say it's because they were
born in Heisei period or

301
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,662
they're millennials and put
all blame on the generation.

302
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,130
Isn't that a mentality of
denying individuality?

303
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,131
No, it's not!

304
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,900
You were severely bashed
by the older generation

305
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,402
and you're going to repeat it to
the younger generation as well?

306
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,904
Well, well...

307
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,274
Anyway, Sakuma,
can you go on leave for a week?

308
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:35,842
What?

309
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,577
You're suspended.

310
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,712
Why me?

311
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,880
It's just a formality.

312
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,885
So the company won't be criticized
for not doing anything.

313
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,161
It was sent from my hometown.

314
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,999
It's Saga Beef sirloin steak.

315
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,302
Wow! Amazing!

316
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,871
How would you like your steak done?

317
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,574
Rare? Medium?

318
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,677
Hey, Martin.

319
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,081
It doesn't matter.

320
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,653
Oh yeah! There'll be a three-day
weekend, right?

321
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:23,590
Shall we go somewhere using our paid
leave? To hot spring, perhaps?

322
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,792
Or would you like to
check out a property?

323
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,628
There was a nice one
in Kichijoji. 2LDK.

324
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:35,168
Stop dwelling on it. Hey!

325
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,904
What do you mean
"It doesn't matter?"

326
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,909
This is my house.
Now is our time together.

327
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:47,080
There's nothing more important
than the doneness of meat!

328
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,482
What do you think
I should have done?

329
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,085
If you were in my shoes,
what would you do...

330
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,821
if you received complaints
from a regular customer

331
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,956
because of mistakes
made by your junior...

332
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,825
who doesn't take his work seriously.

333
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,331
It wasn't right to yell at him.
Besides, it didn't do anything good.

334
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,272
There's no right answer.
Just leave him alone.

335
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,174
If he keeps on making mistakes

336
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,076
and gets the contract terminated,
it's his mistake.

337
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,911
It's the company that
will suffer the loss.

338
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,815
- I thought he died.
- Huh?

339
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,451
Yamagishi.

340
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,954
I thought he jumped
in front of a train.

341
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,091
I regretted it at once.

342
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,495
After scolding a junior
for the first time,

343
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,864
he died the following day.

344
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,502
It wasn't him though.

345
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,906
But people die just like that.

346
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,510
Then, the one who killed...

347
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,081
I didn't kill him, but...

348
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,817
I'll keep on living...

349
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,286
while dwelling on it.

350
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:05,125
Then, people will console you
that it wasn't your fault.

351
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,661
And eventually,
you'll feel that way.

352
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:14,067
When you thought that
everything will be fine,

353
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,071
somehow you'll get scared.

354
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,411
- Akane.
- Huh?

355
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,882
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

356
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,085
- What?
- Well...

357
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,689
I just remembered I had a classmate

358
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:37,857
back in senior high school who died.

359
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,594
We were not particularly close,

360
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,496
but at the funeral,

361
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,300
I was pissed off with the people
who wailed in sorrow.

362
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:51,671
The guys who actually bullied him
didn't even show up.

363
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:58,445
Watching such funeral full of
unrelated people crying...

364
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,981
I though, I didn't want to die.

365
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,122
I don't know what else
I wanted to say.

366
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,863
You'll be fine, Martin.

367
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,501
You're the kind of guy who cries
even if you're not related.

368
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,505
What do you mean?

369
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,111
I'll have my steak medium.

370
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:34,948
Hello?

371
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,282
Sir...

372
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,319
you gave away discount coupons
again, didn't you?

373
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,621
Somehow a strange person
lingerd around.

374
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,123
He said, "I won't order
until Sakama arrives."

375
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,127
Martin, the bike key. Here you go.

376
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,362
Thank you.

377
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,748
(Discount Coupon)

378
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,251
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

379
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,557
(Store Manager)
(Sakuma)

380
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,260
What's that sense of intimidation?

381
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,362
Are they yakuza?

382
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,464
- You idiot!
- Ouch!

383
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,139
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

384
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,277
Check, please.

385
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,912
- That's it?
- That's it.

386
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,948
I also thought he'd beat me up.

387
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,549
Don't tell me...

388
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,319
he intends to use up
all the 100 yen coupons.

389
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,087
So that's why he came
the following day too.

390
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,724
- Draft beer.
- One draft beer!

391
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,559
One draft beer!

392
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,964
You're suspended, right?

393
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,399
I heard you're currently suspended.

394
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,703
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.

395
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,770
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

396
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,439
Table number three is ready.

397
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,573
Okay!

398
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,451
Check, please.

399
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,885
(1,000 yen)

400
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:55,888
- Draft beer.
- One draft beer!

401
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,023
One draft beer!

402
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,157
I'll have a draft beer also.

403
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,661
Buy your own drinks! Come on!

404
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,730
Hey, Nakamori!

405
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,732
After all, I didn't confine
myself at home.

406
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,901
I go everyday to grill two sticks of
yakitori only. What about you?

407
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,270
I'm sorry. Excuse me,

408
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,239
but I heard my son has been
disturbing your restaurant.

409
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,841
We just finished talking about that.

410
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:15,808
What?

411
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,976
By the way,
what do you intend to do?

412
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,978
At that point when your son
took the personal information

413
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,314
you're no longer convincing
as Uncle-For-Rent.

414
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:24,050
I'm really sorry.

415
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:27,787
Certainly, it was easier to vent out
to a complete stranger.

416
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,689
If that's the case...

417
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,858
why don't you just request
for someone else?

418
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,495
- Well then, please change.
- No! Could you please consider it?

419
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,463
I really regret what I've done.

420
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,732
I don't feel like asking for advice
from someone who's soul-searching.

421
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,734
- Welcome to our cafe.
- Thank you.

422
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:43,936
The usual, please.

423
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,440
I'll do it though.

424
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,175
What is it about?
The trainee in question?

425
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,443
I also...

426
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,716
like you.

427
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,319
- What?
- You're in love with each other.

428
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,488
Yeah!

429
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,658
After the training, I intend to
officially ask her to go out with me

430
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,061
- Yeah!
- Yesterday...

431
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,471
she walked pass me like this.

432
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,505
Maybe she felt cold.

433
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,741
No, she was avoiding me
'cause she went like this.

434
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,975
- Did you see it?
- Of course not!

435
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,577
Before I could,
she covered up like this.

436
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,645
Maybe you tried to look at it?

437
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,679
What the hell. Don't interrupt.

438
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,281
Maybe she got too conscious
and things got weird.

439
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,716
I'm not sure 'cause

440
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,384
- I have no experience.
- No experience?

441
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,053
If she's trying to avoid me,
I should give up, right?

442
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,188
Did you say you have no experience?

443
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,391
Never mind that. Just casually
ignore it. What do you think?

444
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,527
In the first place, she was the one
who confessed her feelings.

445
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,597
What? You have no experience?

446
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:48,367
- Darn it! It was almost ignored!
- Does it mean

447
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:51,204
you've never dated a woman before?

448
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,306
Well, yes.
It wasn't particularly necessary.

449
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,741
Instead of wasting time on
a relationship,

450
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,444
I'd rather spend it for myself
like reading books for my knowledge.

451
00:22:58,578 --> 00:22:59,679
Got a problem with that?

452
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,048
- I see.
- You were about to say asexual.

453
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,716
I can tell by the movement
of your mouth.

454
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,018
Don't summarize it
in such a cheap word.

455
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:06,986
Yamaji! Yamaji!

456
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,755
By the way, you were about to say
"virgin" earlier, weren't you?

457
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,390
Oh no.

458
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,093
Well, well, Mr. Yamaji.

459
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,064
I don't mind at all.

460
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,434
I happen to reach this age while
thinking I could do it anytime.

461
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,435
Got a problem with that?

462
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,741
(Muneyasu)

463
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,011
You'll catch a cold. Get inside.

464
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,018
Here.

465
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:41,821
Try it.

466
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,356
As I've said, liquor is...

467
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,727
(Honki Shibori Beer)

468
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,895
Local beer?

469
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,963
We've asked a consigner to make it.

470
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,399
After all, it's beer for the summer.

471
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,234
Does Mom know about this?

472
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,471
Nevermind that. Just drink!

473
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,575
If I do the same thing Dad did,
we can't make the company grow.

474
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,312
If you like it, serve it in
your restaurant as well.

475
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,450
Right?

476
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,386
What do you mean "right?"
What the hell is this?

477
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,755
I give up.

478
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,692
How many times was this brewed?

479
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,929
Even if you spill a 10 times-brewed
beer and wipe it off with a cloth

480
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,731
then wring out the beer,
it won't taste like this.

481
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,767
That's all?

482
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,738
We can't just make this much,
you idiot!

483
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:41,881
(Honki Shibori Beer)

484
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,516
What have you done?

485
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,152
Say it yourself.

486
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,155
Bro, look. I passed the interview.

487
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,224
I'll tell her about it tomorrow.

488
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,727
I thought I'd fail 'cause I was late

489
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,964
but I shrugged it off and
was able to express my true self.

490
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,299
You passed? The interview
was for an internship, right?

491
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:03,236
There were seniors who got hired
officially after the internship.

492
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,237
Let me take a look at it.

493
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,672
- Hold on a second.
- What?

494
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,475
Why do you have to bring
the socks Bro took off?

495
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,244
'Cause I just turned on
the washing machine.

496
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,446
Do it yourself.
She's not a housekeeper.

497
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,380
Hey!

498
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,983
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's really no big deal.

499
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:17,950
I'm doing mine anyway.

500
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,986
- I'm really sorry. It's okay.
- 'Cause it'll get stretched.

501
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,454
- No, no. Please.
- Don't worry.

502
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,155
What's going on?

503
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,657
They were talking about
being a housekeeper.

504
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:27,927
Mom, why do you only say
bits and pieces of things?

505
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:28,995
What does it mean?

506
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:29,929
It's okay.

507
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,697
Midori is not a housekeeper.

508
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:32,965
I didn't say that.

509
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,767
Then, who said she's a housekeeper?

510
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,802
I said that she's not a housekeeper.

511
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,137
Well then, shall we
decide by majority?

512
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,739
Why?

513
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:41,474
It's okay.

514
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,342
Whether I'm a housekeeper or not

515
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:44,944
I'll be the one to decide.

516
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,216
"Since it's what the children says

517
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,218
I don't intend to believe
everything,

518
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,687
but please keep in mind to
be careful and responsible

519
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,355
of one's language and behavior."

520
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,491
It says.

521
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,359
I'm sorry.

522
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:04,263
It's not uncommon for
a class teacher and a trainee

523
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,564
to be talked about.

524
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,133
It's a seasonal tradition.

525
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,302
It's still okay while the children
are making noise.

526
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:12,305
But once it reaches
the parents, this happens.

527
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,340
"What's written here is not a fact."

528
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,342
Is it okay if we reply that way?

529
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,743
Yes, of course.

530
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,481
Is there anything wrong?

531
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,684
Ms. Sakura didn't say
anything like that though.

532
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:25,785
What?

533
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:31,424
On the contrary, she asked me for
advice since she was having trouble

534
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,426
'cause Mr. Yamaji approaches
her aggressively.

535
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,662
- What?
- Well, that's what...

536
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:39,231
You mean I aggressively
approached her?

537
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:46,572
Did you know that the two are

538
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,507
from the same batch when
they entered the company?

539
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,143
The store manager and Akane,
the area manager?

540
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,812
Seriously?

541
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,481
Oh no! That's heartrending.

542
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,550
I'm sorry for interrupting,

543
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,386
but I need to go now.
Thank you for the delicious meal.

544
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,488
- Thank you.
- A friend?

545
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:03,923
No.

546
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:05,758
Anyway,
it looks like a younger employee

547
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,227
aroused issues of irresponsibility

548
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,962
and declared threateningly
that he'll officially

549
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,297
make a direct plea
to the labor union.

550
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,365
Yamagishi? Seriously?

551
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,800
Yes, it looks like he hired
a lawyer as well.

552
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:18,237
Well, I'll insist that you're not
accountable for it,

553
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,139
but expect for an interrogation
very soon.

554
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,341
See you tomorrow.

555
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,577
Thank you for your hard work.

556
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,945
Thank you for your hard work.

557
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,681
Excuse me, Sir, your friend...

558
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,449
He's not my friend!

559
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,718
Forgot this.

560
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,487
No way! Definitely not!

561
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,222
I'm not saying anything yet.

562
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,257
Once a crime is uncovered,
teachers get fired.

563
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:41,160
In the first place,
the 120,000 yen is our money.

564
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:43,863
You saw inside?

565
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,465
That's why I asked you
to come here, Yama.

566
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,600
Me?

567
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,704
Please. Go ahead.

568
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,348
Just give it a thought and
you'll know right away.

569
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,552
What about the cash?

570
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,656
A little less than 10,000 yen.
Everything in 1,000 yen bills.

571
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,159
There's a driver's license.
The address is on it.

572
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,061
(Maribu Michigami)

573
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,731
- What? You'll bring it yourself?
- I haven't said anything yet.

574
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,141
After all, it looks like
this is the place.

575
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,844
Of course not. It's a typo.

576
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,979
- No, it's correct.
- Really?

577
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,648
No, I mean...

578
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,183
Papa.

579
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,218
Are you looking for Maribu?
He's here.

580
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,186
- What?
- What?

581
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,556
Maribu! Your friends are here!

582
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,858
No, we're not friends.

583
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,260
(Takaoka Clinic)

584
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,570
You came all the way here
to deliver it.

585
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:58,737
I appreciate it.

586
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,008
Don't just stand there.
Come inside and have a seat.

587
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:06,579
- Well, but...
- What? The house dust bothers you?

588
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,782
No, I mean sorry for coming
this late at night.

589
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,717
Well then, stay outside.

590
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:14,053
No, Madam. Don't.

591
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,388
- Wife?
- What?

592
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,390
How did you know?

593
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:21,494
- I can't think of anything else.
- I panicked.

594
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:25,097
This is my wife, Yuka
and my daughter, Serebu.

595
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,068
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

596
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,737
- There you go.
- Excuse me,

597
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,740
but we're the same age, right?

598
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,842
I was born in 1987. Why?

599
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:40,713
That book. There's a difficult book.

600
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,048
'Cause I'm a student taking
an entrance exam.

601
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,217
- What?
- Haven't you heard from my father?

602
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,319
I failed the college entrance exam.

603
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,555
I heard about that. What?

604
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,190
We're the same age, right?

605
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,993
You're also a first generation
millennial, right? We're the same.

606
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,697
Don't count! I failed 11 times!

607
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,367
I've been busy lately.
Besides, I've got a child now.

608
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,369
I only took
the National Center test.

609
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,237
Do you know?

610
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,606
From this year,
physical science is divided into

611
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,309
physical science and basic physics.
You can now choose three subjects

612
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,677
from the eight science subjects.

613
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,847
During your time, it used to be
Integrated Science A, right?

614
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,448
- I don't remember.
- Have a seat.

615
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:18,984
Somehow...

616
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:20,786
I misunderstood various things.

617
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:21,854
Since when did you start
using honorific language?

618
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,255
Why are you so particular
about college?

619
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,691
I'm not particular about it.

620
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,560
Besides, that old battle-axe...

621
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,161
is telling me to go to
a national university.

622
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,130
I'm referring to my mother.

623
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,200
There's only one college
I want to go.

624
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,902
Since it's a prestigious school
it'd take me about 10 years.

625
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,238
- But...
- I told you, have a seat.

626
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,740
If you three remain standing
while I sit alone

627
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,742
people would think that
I'm the one who's wrong.

628
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,946
It's not three against one,
but four against one.

629
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,314
Even if you enter college from now

630
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,815
by the time you find work,
you'll be 33 years old, right?

631
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,051
I'm not going to find work.
Why do I have to be pushed around

632
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,686
by someone who's dumber than myself?

633
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:54,820
What?

634
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,922
If that's the case, I could either
be a doctor or a lawyer.

635
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,728
Got it.

636
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,131
I just have to stand instead, right?

637
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,735
Then, let me ask you.

638
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,071
How did you choose your university?

639
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,607
A college where I'll
likely pass the exam.

640
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,777
What about the company?

641
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,880
A company where I'll likely
get an official job offer.

642
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,383
Amazing!

643
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,987
Amazing!

644
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,922
He went to college where he'll
likely pass the entrance exam.

645
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,590
He got into a company where
he'll likely be accepted.

646
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,726
He hasn't resigned and
continue to work until now.

647
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,527
Isn't that amazing?

648
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:40,366
Sorry if I've put you
in a bad mood. Sorry,

649
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,434
I'm seriously impressed.
'Cause you know what,

650
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,937
if it were a game, you're doing
the same thing over and over

651
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,438
without going to the next level

652
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,941
which is supposedly easy to clear.

653
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:53,579
It's impossible.
I don't have skills like that.

654
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,981
That's why I live like this.

655
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,820
- Here's the money.
- No, it's okay.

656
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,589
No, I shouldn't keep this.
I misunderstood it.

657
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,658
I thought you were more
of an ambitious person.

658
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,726
- Take it. I said take it!
- No, really...

659
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,496
Having yakitori everyday
is also hard for me.

660
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:11,930
- Really! It's okay!
- Why?

661
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,966
Really! It's okay!

662
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,469
Please go home soon!
It's time I breastfeed my baby!

663
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,440
Does it mean this is my grandchild?

664
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,576
The father is currently preparing to
take the university entrance exam.

665
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,178
I know.

666
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,548
Anyway, I wonder how Maribu...

667
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,851
named Serebu and how it's written.

668
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,286
Papa, look!

669
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,822
Ah, Maui!

670
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,027
Amazing!

671
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,265
I'm sorry to bother you.

672
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,233
You came all the way
to Kamakura,

673
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,269
but I couldn't tour you around
'cause it's family day today.

674
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,704
No problem.

675
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,739
I mean...

676
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,676
it's not uncommon for someone
my age to have children.

677
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,145
Beside, Mr. Sakama has a girlfriend.

678
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,481
I'm the only one somehow...

679
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,717
feeling cold.

680
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,019
What? Didn't you say...

681
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,554
it wasn't necessary?

682
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:09,755
Yes, I did, but...

683
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,559
I'm not at an age to say
such things anymore.

684
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,728
I feel cold.

685
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,701
- Here you go.
- That's not what I mean.

686
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:23,736
I know.

687
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,772
Is that so?

688
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,941
You went to the hospital and
found out it was someone else.

689
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,944
I'm sorry. It was hard
to tell you that time.

690
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,413
How young are you?

691
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,515
Since it's his second year
in the company

692
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,617
I guess he's 23 or 24 years old.

693
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:42,621
That's not what I mean. I'm asking
your age, Mr. Sakama.

694
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,224
Me? I'm 29 years old.

695
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,826
Are you the eldest son?
Are your parents in good health?

696
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,596
No, my father passed away.

697
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:55,067
My family runs a small sake brewery

698
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,769
and my elder brother
is the 6th generation.

699
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,906
My younger sister is
a student looking for a job,

700
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:04,343
She's busy attending job fairs
and internships on holidays.

701
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,613
Since she's a confident person
who's ignorant of the world

702
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,114
I'm worried whether
she's qualified to work.

703
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,949
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

704
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,952
Since I use Mac at home,
I'm not familiar with Windows.

705
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:19,324
Could someone assist her?
The intern is having trouble.

706
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,593
I'm sorry to bother you
while you're at work.

707
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,929
I'm sorry to bother you
while you're at work.

708
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,397
I'm sorry to bother you
while you're at work.

709
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,035
I'm sorry for talking
so much about myself.

710
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,137
It's okay.

711
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,941
Oh dear, it's beautiful. Excuse me.

712
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:44,983
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

713
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,518
No, please don't bother.

714
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:50,389
Please have lunch. I don't feel
like cooking whenever I'm alone.

715
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,359
I know it's hard for you to ask
so let me just talk.

716
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,663
When he was a child,
he was affectionate.

717
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,600
Since my husband passed away,

718
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,136
he became a whole new person.
He became cheerful.

719
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,805
He participated in
local festivals and--

720
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,807
Please help me with this.

721
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:09,942
Okay.

722
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,744
He participated in
volunteer activities

723
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,180
and everyone liked him.

724
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:21,053
Come to think about it, I guess
he was concerned of me

725
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,556
that he didn't want me to worry.

726
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,161
Are there any reasons?

727
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,398
I really can't think of anything.

728
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,802
Please take a look at his
computer browsing history.

729
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:50,816
Right?

730
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,851
On the night before, he was

731
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:55,354
giving advices to strangers
on their personal problems.

732
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,056
He showed me he was
chosen as "The best answer."

733
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,260
See! Do you think a person who plans
to commit suicide would do this?

734
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,028
Will you answer earnestly

735
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,364
to the sexual problem of
a high school student?

736
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:13,939
But you know what...

737
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,009
according to Mr. Goto...

738
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,344
Ah, Mr. Goto. Yes.

739
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,713
- I'm terribly sorry!
- Hiroyuki...

740
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:25,717
accepted a job that was
too much to handle alone.

741
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:30,689
Eventually, he cried to Mr. Goto
and asked for help from him

742
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,725
two to three times.

743
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,327
It's okay.

744
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,095
Since then, Mr. Goto

745
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,565
asked him whether he's okay
and offered to help.

746
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,967
It looks like Mr. Goto was
quite worried about him.

747
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,901
Here you go.

748
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:46,138
(Patience)

749
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:47,806
But...

750
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,976
he was transferred last April.

751
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,347
If only he was by his side,
he could have noticed it.

752
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,649
He said it's frustrating.

753
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,689
Oh dear, I...

754
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,725
What am I making?

755
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,060
I thought...

756
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:10,829
I was making yakisoba.

757
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:12,931
Yakisoba?

758
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,200
Did I say that?

759
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,735
No, you didn't,

760
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,938
but from what you've been doing
I somehow figured it out.

761
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,474
There's no noodles.

762
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,642
What?

763
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,349
I've got udon though.

764
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,684
Udon...

765
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,554
Let's have yakiudon!

766
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,255
- Sure.
- Right.

767
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,264
It's the first time I was able

768
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,766
to talk about Hiroshi without crying

769
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,102
- Is that so?
- Yes.

770
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,637
Thank you.

771
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:56,742
Sometimes, when it crosses your mind

772
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,243
could you pass by?

773
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,811
What? You mean me?

774
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,714
People from his office
also come to visit,

775
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:05,350
but I can't tell them the truth.

776
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,954
That's because I'm not
related to him, right?

777
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:09,855
Yes.

778
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,578
What the hell. Darn it.

779
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,315
After all, I cry.

780
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,552
What a shame.

781
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,032
What? You're alone?

782
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,200
What about the female
college student?

783
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,237
I told you I don't think she
will come. I invited her though.

784
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,107
Well, then, I guess I'll go home.

785
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,743
No, please.
You came all the way here.

786
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,944
That's right.

787
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:07,312
I'll have lunch then.

788
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,613
- What?
- What?

789
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,148
- What? Well...
- Ah.

790
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,653
Why do you eat alone?
It's very you, Yamaji.

791
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,388
Mr. Sakama,
what do you know about me?

792
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,656
He's this kind of person.

793
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,193
Well, this is Akane Miyashita.

794
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,494
Ah, no. It's for her.

795
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,229
We met last time at the rip-off bar.

796
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,300
That's right.
I'm terribly sorry for that time.

797
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,601
- What?
- What?

798
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,269
I'm here.

799
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,809
- Ah!
- Did you just hit it?

800
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:40,278
- I didn't see it.
- What?

801
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,680
Oh no!

802
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,982
- I think I'm winning at this point.
- You're kidding me!

803
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,384
I don't want to lose.

804
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,454
I'm sorry about what
happened last time

805
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,156
- at the faculty room.
- Huh?

806
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,161
No, it's okay.
I don't really care about it.

807
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,530
The vice principal pressed me
for an answer

808
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,565
and I had no choice
but to say such things.

809
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,568
I thought so. I understand.

810
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:05,971
Well, it's a seasonal tradition.

811
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,139
Akane, do you want something
to drink?

812
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,908
Yes, soft drinks! Afterall, it's...

813
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,851
Yamagishi.

814
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,286
Yamagishi?

815
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,189
The talked-about Yamagishi?

816
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,430
Ms. Sakura, would you like to try?

817
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,866
- What? Me too?
- Of course.

818
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,601
Hold on. I'll put this here.

819
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,739
What was the name
of your subordinate again?

820
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:42,607
It's Yamagishi.

821
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,777
I don't know what kind of
a person Mr.Yamagishi is,

822
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,346
whether he's a good or bad person.

823
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,716
If you happen to meet him again,

824
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:53,985
be kind to him.

825
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,555
But...

826
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,391
Yamagishi and your son,
they are different.

827
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,327
It's the same thing 'cause they
both have parents, right?

828
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,728
You too.

829
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,330
Yes.

830
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,737
(Patience)

831
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:21,813
Here you go.

832
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,119
There's nothing good
if you get emotional.

833
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:35,527
I don't want to see you suffer...

834
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,032
like what happened to Mr. Goto.

835
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,343
Shall we go home?

836
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,747
I'm sorry.

837
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:04,923
Come on, Mom and Mune.
Please talk to each other.

838
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,060
Good morning.

839
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,196
Why did you keep silent about it?

840
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,330
What?

841
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,533
Zokin Shibori?

842
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,770
Hey! It's "Honki Shibori!"

843
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:21,206
What a waste of money!

844
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:24,476
First, you just have to
take over Dad's position.

845
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,945
He died leaving you
the connection and skill.

846
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,414
What about Yutori? She has
internship today as well, right?

847
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,151
She wouldn't wake up.
Looks like it didn't go very well.

848
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,121
What are you doing?

849
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,189
It's not good for an intern
to be late.

850
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,558
I'm not going.

851
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,192
Why?

852
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:44,162
I thought it was a company
that was more creative and open.

853
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,764
It was nearly sweatshop.

854
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,433
Besides, the employees are
unfriendly. The canteen is super--

855
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,402
- Then, don't get a job.
- Why not?

856
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,737
The company you like
is nowhere to find.

857
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,140
And no company will like you either.

858
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:56,975
How mean.

859
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,444
That's not what it's like to
step out into the world,

860
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,313
not working and receive salary!

861
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,114
Look at your brother!

862
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,383
I finally got into a company,

863
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:07,619
but due to my poor performance,
I'm sent around.

864
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,021
At last, a subordinate sued me
for power harassment.

865
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:11,823
Seriously?

866
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,491
After compensating for
the mistakes of a subordinate

867
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,027
and working for seven years,
I thought I'd finally made

868
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,663
contribution to the company.
And now this power harassment issue!

869
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,299
I've never imagined this life as
a full-fledged member of society.

870
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,802
But your brother will do it.

871
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:24,970
I make rounds of customers

872
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,805
and bow my head. Grill yakitori

873
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,940
and get pushed around by a part-time
worker who's elder than me.

874
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,009
Be laughed at by the juniors.
By all means, I won't quit!

875
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,345
If I quit now,
there's nothing I'll gain.

876
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,447
Until I get a return, I won't quit.

877
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,616
That's why you cannot quit!

878
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,351
Until you get a return, don't quit.

879
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:49,728
Thank you.

880
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,931
Somehow I feel much better now.

881
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:54,766
What?

882
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:04,576
Hey, Bro! Send me to the station!

883
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,782
Hold on a second!

884
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,153
Yutori! Rice balls!

885
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,057
Eat it in the car. Here you go.

886
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:22,160
- Thank you, Sis.
- Take care.

887
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,161
See you later.

888
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,070
- See you later!
- See you later!

889
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,143
Don't get emotional.
Don't get provoked.

890
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:39,978
Maintain your presence of mind.

891
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,346
Yes.

892
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,321
(Patience)

893
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,358
Over here, please.

894
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,734
Well then, shall we start?

895
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,570
I came as the representative
of the labor union.

896
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,140
I'm Aoki. And this is
Yamagishi's legal advisor.

897
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:10,575
I'm Asakura.

898
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:13,945
Please allow me to record it
for documentation.

899
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:20,952
Before that, you apologize.

900
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,523
Hey! Apologize first!
You middle-aged man!

901
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:28,059
Come on, Mr. Yamagishi. Calm down.

902
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:34,132
Kneel down on the floor.

903
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,970
First, it should start from that!

904
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,806
Hey! Do I have to teach you how?

905
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,807
Stop it!

906
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:45,143
You too, bastard! Apologize!
Area manager!

907
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,314
I'll upload.

908
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:53,151
I'll upload this on the internet.

909
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,989
(Patience)

910
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,190
Trial court?

911
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,593
That's a millennial monster.

912
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:03,161
Thank you for your hard work.

913
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,396
If he calls now,
she'll likely be proposed.

914
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,899
I thought you were under
suspension and feeling down.

915
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,734
I was worried for nothing.

916
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,737
- We'll divide it into--
- We're not friends.
