1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:02,036
I'm uploading this to the internet.

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:04,505
Yamagishi-san, calm down.

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,673
Calm down.

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:12,213
Mr. Yamagishi wants to apply
for worker's compensation.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,382
You're aware of the
approval criteria?

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,984
He is experiencing a
psychological disorder.

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,322
He experienced psychological
duress from 6 months at work.

8
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,657
Um ... is something wrong with him?

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,159
Depression. It's depression.

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,528
You doubt me?

11
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,263
We have surmised that his case

12
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:32,800
falls in the power-harassment
category;

13
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,036
the case is summarized in the
paperwork, have a look.

14
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:39,273
The first here, as you know, is the
usage of the expression "gruntwork."

15
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,108
- "As we know"?
- You can do the gruntwork!

16
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,277
- But I ...
- He said it!

17
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,012
You said it, didn't you?

18
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,782
There were plenty others who
heard you say it.

19
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,351
I'm not denying it. I was just...

20
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:58,025
responding to his words:
"I don't want to do gruntwork."

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,594
He was then forcefully
taken to a client,

22
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,863
and compelled to make an apology.

23
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,965
I am sorry!

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,700
No, no, no.

25
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,570
He erred in receiving an
order, he had to apologize.

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,572
We shall hear your
counterarguments later.

27
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,743
As the situation settled, he
recounted his error...

28
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,679
I feel I was reprimanded fairly.

29
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,515
You snorted and made fun of him.

30
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,884
That's the reason why
you're a Yutori.

31
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:27,221
No, no, no...
Huh?

32
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,723
I was just masking my
embarassment.

33
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,227
I'm also a Yutori,
so I used that term with affection.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,063
We must also mentioned forced
unpaid overtime.

35
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:40,101
Making pesky invitations to attend
a drinking party, against his will.

36
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,837
Oh, the drinking party!

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,341
They made me oversee it, even though
I'm only in my first year here.

38
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,678
I've saved the back-and-forth texts
regarding that situation.

39
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,714
What happens if his worker's
comp gets approved?

40
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,649
I wonder...

41
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:59,153
A trial will be expensive,
I propose a settlement.

42
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,990
Let's take it to court.
I'm confident to go all the way.

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,060
Going to court will be
more expensive than a settlement.

44
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,896
This isn't a matter of money,
it's about me!

45
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,965
I've been hurt because of this guy.

46
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,601
- Enough is enough!
- Wow, scary!

47
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:18,973
Did you see that? This person
pointed her finger at me.

48
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,274
Scary.

49
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,610
What do you say, Sakama-san?

50
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,947
It'll be in no one's interest to
make matters worse.

51
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,683
As the wrongdoer, you should admit
to power-harassment...

52
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,618
Wrongdoer?

53
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,422
I'm the wrongdoer?

54
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,191
Huh? What are you talking about?

55
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,093
I'm the victim of your wrongdoing.

56
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,796
If I weren't as tough as I am, I
would've committed suicide by now.

57
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,901
But I truly don't believe I did
anything wrong.

58
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,937
I found them. I found the texts.

59
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,009
"Did you reserve a spot?"
"I did."

60
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,645
"It's a party of 40 people."
"I'm sorry."

61
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,880
"It's the day after tomorrow."
"Yes, it's set."

62
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,782
"It's today, you know."
"Yes, it's set."

63
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,285
"Forget about it."
"I'm sorry."

64
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:05,486
Normal stuff.

65
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,154
What did you just say?

66
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,256
His attitude at work...

67
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,327
was definitely lacking seriousness.

68
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,264
His handling of our clients was
also unsatisfactory.

69
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,201
I figured I should warn him for his
own sake...

70
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,807
and I gave him guidance.

71
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,676
I did nothing excessive.

72
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,946
Well?

73
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,182
- Was I wrong?
- I don't know.

74
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,451
He's trying to increase the
settlement money.

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,423
You could say he's self-indulgent.

76
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,558
To him it's a matter of expression.

77
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,562
He revels in the idea of
him suing the company.

78
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,632
Doesn't he realize the more fuss he
raises, the harder it'll be to stay?

79
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,034
Oh, but I guess he's quitting so he
doesn't care.

80
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,235
Huh?

81
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,471
What makes you think
I'm going to quit?

82
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,807
But you said you were quitting,
on LINE.

83
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,243
No, I have to work. The trial is
going to be expensive.

84
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,813
I have to make up for
the time I've lost.

85
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,182
He's expecting allowances
to be made?

86
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,952
We were able to have another
discussion the day after.

87
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,222
His attitude was completely
different; like a victim.

88
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,257
Some how...

89
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,828
Some how...

90
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,365
During my previous statement...

91
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,969
I had gotten overly emotional...

92
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,509
Does that mean you're recalling
the lawsuit?

93
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,380
- I'm suing.
- What?

94
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,350
- I'm suing.
- Huh?

95
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,353
However, he must've figured
a settlement would be better.

96
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,823
No, no, no... It should be at least
this much.

97
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,694
- A hundred-thousand?
- One million, you jerk!

98
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,429
Don't lowball me.

99
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,599
He's an allowances-monster.

100
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,469
If I were to write a formal
letter of apology

101
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,105
and pay his settlement, the issue
would be peaceably settled.

102
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,675
Would you be satisfied with that?

103
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,277
You wouldn't be, right?
Afterall, ...

104
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,780
you did nothing wrong.

105
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:40,307
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

106
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,880
You can't leave too much fat
on the skin either.

107
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,049
And why is that?

108
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,720
Because if the fat catches fire
the whole thing burns.

109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,757
And yet, too little fat
isn't good either.

110
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,894
And why is that?

111
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,864
You listening?

112
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,032
No, I'm sorry.

113
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,901
Master, six skins,
eight leeks please.

114
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,737
Was that an instance of
power harassment?

115
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,804
Huh?

116
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,440
People talking from the front and
back; that was irritating.

117
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,242
I wonder if I can sue you for
power harassment.

118
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,010
Remember very clearly.

119
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,047
Where was the store in the Asagaya
Pearl Center?

120
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,149
What was it selling?

121
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,884
Please make sure to color
them separately.

122
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,786
That's not correct.

123
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,890
Ellen-chan, where's your color pen?

124
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,362
You're supposed to use different
colors for different shops.

125
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,699
Did you forget to bring
your color pens?

126
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,603
I won't know if how to help
if you just keep quiet.

127
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,175
You can borrow mine.

128
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,560
Bullying?

129
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,231
Shimoyama Ellen is
getting bullied?

130
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,768
I don't know about that...

131
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,937
Inoue Ayaka let her borrow
her pen.

132
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,839
It's because she's the culprit.

133
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,474
"Culprit"?

134
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,144
Wait a sec...

135
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,685
It was tossed into the
janitor's trash bin.

136
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,490
Are you aware...

137
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,360
that there is a Inoue sect and
Saotome sect among the girls?

138
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,696
No... yes. No.

139
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,366
When those two became conducting
candidates at the singing contest,

140
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,604
Shimoyama Ellen
didn't enter a vote for either girl.

141
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,839
Is that so?

142
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,842
She's become the classroom
reject ever since.

143
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,611
Because she doesn't belong
to either sect? I see.

144
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,880
May I contact her parents?

145
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,850
Huh? What, out of the blue?

146
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,951
Whose parents are you calling?

147
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,119
The parents of both of them.

148
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,155
You should talk to the kids first.

149
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,927
I think information should be
shared with the parents.

150
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:14,862
Why?

151
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,297
Because those children will
continue bullying.

152
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,634
Parents and teachers need to
cooperate and watch over them.

153
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,902
Why for?

154
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,238
Because this is an urgent matter.

155
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,440
Why do you think that?

156
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,977
Because I read something like
this on the internet.

157
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,145
There's a website where parents

158
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,382
and teachers give advice,

159
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,985
based on their own experiences of
having been bullied.

160
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,186
Um...

161
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,490
That's not what I meant when
I asked you "why".

162
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,060
I meant, why are you so sure
that Inoue Ayaka

163
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,130
stole Shimoyama Ellen's pen?

164
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:53,033
What? I just told you didn't I...

165
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,035
Right, there's sectarian
partisanship.

166
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,238
But it could be Saotome's fault, or
it could be someone else's prank.

167
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,007
Maybe these color pens

168
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,075
aren't even Shimoyama's,
to begin with.

169
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,680
Before you rely on the internet, you
should investigate on your own.

170
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,653
Let's talk in the hall.

171
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,688
It's too late. What's going on?

172
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,024
Well you see, in class...

173
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,025
Uh...

174
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,228
All right.

175
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,801
- Maruyama-sensei, please excuse us.
- What for?

176
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,906
Sakura-sensei.

177
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,742
I was being too opinionated.
I apologize.

178
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,644
It's okay.

179
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,815
Women know how women
feel better than men do.

180
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,218
Let's hear what the students have
to say, tomorrow.

181
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,489
Oh!

182
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,195
- Oh!
- Oh, hi.

183
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:00,233
- You rock climb?
- Yes, but I'm just a beginner.

184
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,202
I do this occasionally...

185
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,937
but it's my first on this wall.

186
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,639
Is that so?

187
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,508
I like it here, it's not crowded.

188
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,311
And the wall's quite high too.

189
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,480
You're right.

190
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,487
I'm here alone. By myself.

191
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,259
Man, "Suzume"...

192
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,328
What the heck is "Hansuzume"?

193
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,201
I'm not repentant.

194
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,071
You can't do that, Yamaji-kun;
you overstepped your bounds.

195
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,474
Women know how women
feel better than men do.

196
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,111
You've implied that her mentality
is like an elementary schooler's.

197
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,646
I don't think she'd interpret
it that way.

198
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:52,853
Tough girls like her must be treated
and spoken to as an adult.

199
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,354
Then...

200
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:58,158
every now and then, you have to be
sweet to her too.

201
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,161
I know, but it's all a
matter of timing.

202
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,931
The timing's hard to discern.

203
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,868
- Because you're a virgin.
- That's got nothing to do with it.

204
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,103
Wait a second, how did you know?

205
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,271
Um...

206
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,906
How could you tell?

207
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,808
- Get out of my way.
- Sorry.

208
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,812
Please don't say a thing
about that to her.

209
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,015
Really.

210
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,885
I've passed the threshold of being
sweet-talked to like a girl.

211
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,054
What?

212
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,056
How about Sakama-kun?

213
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,657
Not at all.

214
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,093
Relatives, colleagues, everybody
comes to me for advice.

215
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,396
They think I'm their mother.

216
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,632
Mom. Where's the ink pad?

217
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,368
In the third drawer of
your father's drawer.

218
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,470
Mom, can I have Yakisoba?

219
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,572
Which drawer is his?

220
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,974
- It must be this.
- Oh, I see.

221
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,777
Mom. Make me Yakisoba.

222
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,947
Mom, what day is it tomorrow?
Oh, the calendar.

223
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:58,051
Mom, you put Masakazu's underwear
in my drawer again.

224
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,486
Well, it wasn't me.

225
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,922
Mom, what's the date tomorrow?

226
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,091
I can't take it anymore.

227
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,828
Mom, where's my Yakisoba?

228
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,730
You're not getting married?

229
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,200
-No way, not a chance.
-Oh.

230
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,402
- Are you trying to say something?
- No.

231
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,303
You're not going to?

232
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,840
I don't know you well enough
for starters.

233
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,944
I'll probably marry eventually.

234
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,814
- But he treats marriage lightly.
- Huh?

235
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,154
He's obviously using marriage as
some kind of pretext.

236
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,255
Some kind?

237
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,524
That's not it.

238
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,193
I just want to get marriage.
Hear what I'm saying?

239
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,562
Yeah.

240
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:46,099
A marriage without extra baggage, a
marriage without pretexts.

241
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,634
Ah.

242
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,203
It's like all a virgin wants
is to have sex.

243
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,173
Maybe you better not tell him that.

244
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,277
Yama-chan, what's your first name?

245
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,480
Oh, it's Kazutoyo: 'Kazu' and
'Ho' of 'Hosaku'.

246
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,015
What's that?

247
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,519
- They should've named you Hosaku.
- No, they shouldn't.

248
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,487
And your first name is...

249
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,690
- It's Akane.
- Akane-chan?

250
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,326
Say, Akane-chan...

251
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,129
are you going to tell Sakama-kun

252
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,532
that you and I talked today?

253
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,367
I won't.

254
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,802
-Why?
-Well, you know...

255
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,504
It might be more meaningful

256
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,007
if you don't.

257
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,074
Huh?

258
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,644
What? What?

259
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,479
No, no, it's not like that.

260
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,048
- Nevermind.
- I won't say a word either.

261
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,517
I won't say it, not a word.

262
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,721
Ouch!

263
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,592
Virgin!

264
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,695
- Don't say that!
- Virgin!

265
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,730
Too loud!

266
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,008
- Yikes!
- Yikes!

267
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,911
- I wasn't surprising you.
- I know you weren't.

268
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,481
But why were you standing
behind me so quietly?

269
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,950
Because I didn't want to
be downstairs.

270
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,452
Hey...

271
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,721
you shouldn't smoke. It'll
affect your fertility.

272
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,190
I smoke off and on.

273
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,528
It's not about fertility.

274
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,197
It's about perseverance.

275
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,934
Perseverance.

276
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,738
I know that,
but this can't be helped.

277
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,140
It's okay by me.
Masakau is always here,

278
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,078
and even Yutori will
get married someday.

279
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,714
It's just that...

280
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,118
she's rueful her dad never
saw his grandchildren.

281
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,653
It makes her weep.

282
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,888
- Midori cries about it?
- It pressures me.

283
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,424
Just moments ago,
she just up and walked away.

284
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,562
Even I feel it.
I should never pressure her.

285
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,031
This is terrible.

286
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,768
I was once a young bride...

287
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,471
now I'm a mother-in-law.

288
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,340
So please, take action fast.

289
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,942
I'm working on it.

290
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,912
I'm not galavanting
or anything...

291
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,514
I'm planning things out.

292
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:18,018
Do it instead of planning
on doing it.

293
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,686
You're forty years old,
aren't you?

294
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,822
My business has to run
smoothly first.

295
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,425
That failed beer idea
got you in debt.

296
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,394
Don't call it a "failed" idea!

297
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,068
Everyone, put the color
pens on your desks.

298
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,908
Everybody has pens except
Shimoyama-san, right?

299
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,447
Which must mean, then...

300
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,717
these color pens belong to
Shimoyama-san.

301
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,685
Yes.

302
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:56,089
You were worried because
you had no pens.

303
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,357
You know what that means?

304
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,893
That means somebody here is
being a bully.

305
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,296
- If that's the case, our class...
- Okay, everybody.

306
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,298
Let's close our eyes.

307
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,470
All eyes closed?
No cheating now.

308
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:14,674
If you want to respond, please
raise your hand.

309
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,411
"I threw Shimoyama-san's
color pens...

310
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,980
"...into the trash bin."

311
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,351
We promise not to scold
you for being honest.

312
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,088
I know you want to apologize.

313
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:29,756
Go on.

314
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:41,468
To be honest, I wanted to be
the conductor too.

315
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,337
But before I could announce
my candidacy...

316
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,807
Inoue-san and Saotome-san both

317
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,110
asked me to vote for them.

318
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,046
You didn't want to choose one
over the other?

319
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,385
That's why I decided not to
choose one over another.

320
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,721
That's why both of them
gave you the silent treatment?

321
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:06,693
No. Saotome-san and I go home
together after school.

322
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,129
We're good friends as
we've ever been.

323
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,768
But things were awkard
with Inoue-san.

324
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,005
I like them. I wanted to reconcile
with her, and...

325
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,008
I thought the only chance I had
was during sociology.

326
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,011
You threw your own
pens into the trash bin?

327
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,515
But...

328
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,051
I didn't have the courage to
ask to borrow hers...

329
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,422
Is all this true? You're not
covering up for anybody?

330
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,993
Why did you throw your
own pens away?

331
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,095
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:47,133
You had us worried, we thought
you were getting bullied.

333
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,269
I didn't notice at all though.

334
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:56,176
I'm sorry. Etsuko-sensei,
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,254
Excuse me, we'd like to order.

336
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,323
One moment please.

337
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,029
Hmm, well...

338
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,032
this would be a standard
formal letter of apology, but...

339
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,835
Sakama-san.

340
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:27,073
The harasser and victim
legally can't work together.

341
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,010
If the worker's comp is on
and the accusation stands,

342
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,545
as long as Yamagishi is here,

343
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,482
it means you can't
work here anymore.

344
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,151
It means your life
will get derailed.

345
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,788
I'll work at the shop and climb
my way up.

346
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,324
Listen.

347
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,961
You won't climb back
up again, for good.

348
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,263
I'll cross that bridge...

349
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,131
when I get there.

350
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,334
You're going to quit?

351
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,906
Why don't you go
to trial instead?

352
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,241
Trial?

353
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,376
Against Yamagishi?

354
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,651
I'm alive.
That's good enough for me.

355
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,619
Well...

356
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,655
you were thought dead.
Somebody died on train tracks.

357
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,594
Let's wait and see what
his next move is.

358
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,697
I'll keep this for you.

359
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,007
I want something light.

360
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,243
I knew that was you,
Yama-chan.

361
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:41,314
Hey... Yama-chan.

362
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,082
Hey. On your way
home from work?

363
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,585
Confirming your order:
2 lemon sours...

364
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,487
Let me pitch in.

365
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,988
H-hey...

366
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:52,125
-Is he your friend?
-N-no... he's just a street barker.

367
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,927
You know, he barks to get
customers into the pub.

368
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:54,861
Is he with you?

369
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,196
He's not, can't you tell?
We're being harrassed.

370
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,733
So that's 2 lemon sours and the
karaage. Will that be all?

371
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,169
Thank you.

372
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,239
Sorry to barge in.

373
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,241
Enjoy.

374
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,449
Woops, excuse me.

375
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,617
Akane-chan?

376
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,787
So you're here at the
shop sometimes.

377
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,960
Nobody here knows we're
seeing each other.

378
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,495
Don't tell anyone.

379
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,399
What was that all about?

380
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,835
What? Sorry about that.

381
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,204
- The karaage are ready.
- Sakama-kun, Sakama-kun!

382
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,873
Welcome.

383
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,011
You know, Sakama-kun...

384
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,946
you're like Sakana-kun.

385
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,216
Gyo-gyo!

386
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,884
You're in good mood.

387
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:55,555
Yamaji-sensei. is there bullying
in your class?

388
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,823
Not yet.

389
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:57,991
I see.

390
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,793
But we have minor squabbles
all the time.

391
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,731
You're quite a bystander.
You must have lots of patience.

392
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,569
The kids tend to solve their
own problems, so...

393
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,803
Thank you for waiting.

394
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,439
Do you speak to the parents?

395
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,609
I sometimes send
them short notices.

396
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,045
I've read about methods to
stop classroom bullying...

397
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,381
T-toilet!

398
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,083
-But if there is bullying...
-Master, the dinner platter.

399
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,385
Got it.

400
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,788
Kids in class 2 of the 4th grade
are good kids for sure.

401
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:32,859
But I can tell they're stressed,
and they're all different.

402
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,194
Maybe some will be assailants,
and some will be their victims.

403
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:38,464
I think such cases should be
conceptually considered.

404
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,733
- Even if the effort proves futile.
- But...

405
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,469
- What?
- I'm just glad...

406
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,238
...that it wasn't an actual case of
bullying this time.

407
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,607
Wait a second...

408
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,942
what are you saying?

409
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,444
You want to assert
that you were right?

410
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:55,148
No, it's important to be wary...

411
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,649
but it's also important
to have trust.

412
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,951
You didn't trust those kids.

413
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,788
You didn't even notice
until she pointed it out.

414
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,856
Don't get self righteous!

415
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,627
What was that for?

416
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:12,231
Your conversation is stupid,
that's what I think.

417
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,167
H-hey...

418
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,403
Isn't it time for a strip tease?

419
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:22,342
Stop yammering stuff you don't
mean and speak the truth.

420
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,344
Otherwise it's a waste of
time and booze.

421
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,580
What's your problem?

422
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:31,417
Now now. Were we a little
too loud? Sorry.

423
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,419
Hey, I know...

424
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,621
you all were talking loudly so
everybody could hear you.

425
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,258
You want everyone to know that
people in public service

426
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,527
talk about education even when
they're out drinking booze.

427
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,464
We hear you loud and clear...

428
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:48,167
good job, everyone!

429
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:51,337
Step outside, now!

430
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,673
Hey, calm down.

431
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,608
What do you mean by
"speak the truth"?

432
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,044
What do you mean by
"speak the truth"?

433
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:03,816
Example: why are you always
om Yama-chan's case?

434
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:09,088
Are you attacking Yama-chan to
cover up something?

435
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,022
For example.

436
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:13,126
And you and you. You're
interested in this college grad,

437
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,362
but don't know what to do.
Yet, you don't want to leave,

438
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:17,897
so you just keep drinking.

439
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,632
Don't be ridiculous.

440
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,803
That chubby woman there and the
grey-hair comb-over...

441
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,739
are only interested
in the karaage.

442
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,609
And Yama-chan, he just can't wait
to be alone with you.

443
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,611
And you're not averse to that
idea either.

444
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,080
But bushy eyebrows there,
and the thin man here,

445
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,314
don't like that fact.

446
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:39,819
That's why I'm saying, start
the strip tease.

447
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,954
You bastard!

448
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,422
That's enough!

449
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:44,690
Sorry, everybody!

450
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:51,164
- Are you all right?
- I was being friendly, that's all.

451
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,199
Did you kick me?

452
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,536
I'm not trying to get anywhere
with Sakura-sensei.

453
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,605
I mean...

454
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,374
well...

455
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:04,010
you are the first intern I've
ever trained, and...

456
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,313
I was excited. It was a fresh,
new experience for me.

457
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,750
So I look forward to going to
school everyday.

458
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:15,388
I know I'm stuffy to someone
as young as you are.

459
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,523
You might have thought of me
as overbearing.

460
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,259
- Not at all...
- But the children genuinely...

461
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,296
love you.

462
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,966
I cannot win over that,
nor betray them.

463
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,036
So I want you to love those
kids back too.

464
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,605
I don't want you to view them
as "assailants" and "victims"...

465
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:37,677
I realize that yours is only a one
month internship, but still...

466
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:40,580
to those kids...

467
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,784
it could be a month that'll impact
the rest of their lives.

468
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,656
For that precious month, I didn't
want answers from the internet...

469
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,425
What I want to say is...

470
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,965
Never mind becoming
a good teacher.

471
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,501
Become a good human being.

472
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,909
Come on, say something.

473
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:12,845
Yes.

474
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:16,649
- You should've said something.
- I don't know him that well yet.

475
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:20,086
He's my age and he's still a
virgin. Can you believe it?

476
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,989
I believe it. And there he is,
flagging a taxi.

477
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,325
- He flagged it.
- He did.

478
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,628
- And you, sensei?
- Oh my.

479
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,230
I'm walking home.

480
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,366
Some how...

481
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,071
the things you said made
me glad.

482
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,273
Huh?

483
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,176
I feel I was reprimanded fairly.

484
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,581
You're right, I have
to be more aware.

485
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,785
Because this month will also
impact the rest of my life.

486
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,590
That's our Yamaji-kun.

487
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,125
Is that so?

488
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,732
Huh?

489
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,568
Look!

490
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,804
What was that?

491
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,608
I guess Akane-chan's
advice was effective.

492
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,576
I spoke to her as I
would to an adult.

493
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,545
And be sweet when appropriate.

494
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,981
That was her advice
to you, huh?

495
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,650
How much longer...

496
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:30,089
- Is the internship? Training?
- A little over two weeks more.

497
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:33,759
- No nudity till then, eh?
- Stop it, will you?

498
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,594
I partially appreciate
what you did, but...

499
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,697
I also partially despise you
for what you did.

500
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,799
- Oh my.
- Not "oh my".

501
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,536
Cheers.

502
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,574
- What's up?
- I was just thinking...

503
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,444
What you did was exactly what I
did to Yamagishi.

504
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,080
I feel I was reprimanded fairly.

505
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:58,217
I feel I was reprimanded fairly.

506
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,554
Maybe it's a
generation-gap thing.

507
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:06,492
We were once reprimanded,
now <i>we</i> do the reprimanding.

508
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,095
But I got accused of
power harassment.

509
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,298
Power harassment?

510
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,232
That's scary.

511
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,902
Sakama-san is in the midst of
a dispute with a subordinate.

512
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,304
Seriously?

513
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,372
What's going on?

514
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,674
- I'll do him in!
- That's a little hasty, Maribu-kun.

515
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:22,942
All right then...

516
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,345
I'll get a law degree and
be your lawyer.

517
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,279
There's not enough
time for that.

518
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:30,249
In that case, I'll just do him in.
Then he'll shut up for good.

519
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,051
You should shut up for good.

520
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,194
What's with the "Akane-chan"?

521
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,196
Huh?

522
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,032
You said "Akane-chan".

523
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,036
Yamaji-kun, you mentioned her
by her first name.

524
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,172
You saw her only once and
you call her "Akane-chan"?

525
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,207
Oh...

526
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,243
I guess so.

527
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,111
Huh?

528
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,614
So that's all there is to it?

529
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,783
Well...

530
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,720
Yeah. Sorry about that.

531
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,991
That was a weird reaction.

532
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,192
Who is this, "Akane-chan"?

533
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,827
That's why, "Akane-chan"...

534
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,631
You guys! You're not
staying the night here.

535
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,622
Good job.

536
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,260
Thanks to you the
trial was cancelled.

537
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,030
As it should. Besides, how
could a weakling like you

538
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,998
power-harass anybody?

539
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,069
So you can officially go back
to work now?

540
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,606
The compensation suit wasn't
expensive, and...

541
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:05,377
the penalty is 50,000 yen,
and you're laid off for one week.

542
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:08,080
That's the company's decision
concerning your case.

543
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:11,784
Yes. And Yamagishi will take
my place starting today.

544
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,620
Mornin'...

545
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,424
I bet I'm flooded with emails.

546
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,027
What a hassle.

547
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,496
Hey, senpai.

548
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,866
Good job.

549
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:29,635
Good morning.

550
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,208
I see...

551
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,878
If that's the case,
I'll take your place,

552
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,147
and whip this guy into shape.

553
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,616
You better go easy on him.

554
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,618
Besides...

555
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,987
It won't count as power
harassment if I did it.

556
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,555
- Um, Nogami-san.
- This is really good.

557
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,625
This wasn't meant for you.

558
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,295
I see...

559
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,634
you persevered through this
ordeal, Sakama-san.

560
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,202
I know it's improper
for me to say this...

561
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,705
but I have your son to thank.

562
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,909
I think he'd be
happy to hear that.

563
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,678
But then again...

564
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,881
why would he be?
He didn't know you.

565
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,385
Yes, but I feel like
I know him.

566
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,688
Look.

567
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,590
I want you to see something.

568
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,458
This came from the company.

569
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,963
"Due to neglience of the
communicant's obligations,

570
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:35,301
"a consolation of 25 million yen
shall be paid.

571
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,169
"As to the funeral expenses..."

572
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,045
They said it'll go to trial if I'm
dissatisfied with this.

573
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,885
Who's to say if this
money is appropriate or not?

574
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,593
Luckily for you the suit
was settled at 50,000 yen.

575
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,128
Yes.

576
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,570
Is this wine your family's?

577
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,838
Yes, it is.

578
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,740
It's so nice.

579
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,543
Maybe I'll drink some now.

580
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,044
- Right now?
- Yeah.

581
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,583
I feel dissatisfied.

582
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,585
Me too.

583
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,555
Even if his power-harassment
accusation got dropped...

584
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,991
it still feels like a lost match.

585
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,526
Is he feeling down?

586
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:38,197
I haven't spoken with
him so I don't know.

587
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,666
Oh well.

588
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,235
If I called now I
might get a proposal.

589
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,206
Laid off for one week?

590
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,241
Why?

591
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,844
I heard he's disciplined for power
harassment, don't tell anyone.

592
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,446
I'm sorry. So I'll be working
the grill today.

593
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,950
- Cancel.
- But I taught Sakama how to grill.

594
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,285
Listen.

595
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,922
I don't come here because I want
to eat Yakitori.

596
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:07,693
Stop acting tipsy.

597
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,995
I'm out of breath.

598
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,898
You know, I...

599
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,500
- Hey, Yama-chan.
- Hey, Maribu-kun.

600
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,835
Did you hear? Sakama-kun
got disciplined.

601
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:17,970
Oh...

602
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,872
Thank you very much.

603
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:24,443
That pisses me off. I should've
done him in.

604
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,612
Hey, ugly!

605
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,615
You're an important person
aren't you? Do something.

606
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,816
What did you just call me?

607
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,385
- I called you ugly.
- Stop it, please.

608
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,822
Oh! She's Akane-chan?

609
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,860
This?

610
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,129
He meant to say "her".

611
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:50,336
Why are you wearing shades?

612
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,504
- I lifted them up.
- That's not the point.

613
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:55,007
It's impolite to wear shades
when speaking to people.

614
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,408
I see.

615
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,010
Good morning.

616
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:02,548
There he is. The
disciplined man.

617
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,717
Shut up. How long must you
sleep in, anyway?

618
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,952
It's Saturday, who cares?

619
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,622
- Where's mom?
- I dunno.

620
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,161
- Get it.
- You get it.

621
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:22,701
How many interviews did you do
before you got hired?

622
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,604
Seven or eight, I think.

623
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,841
Crap, I've already exceeded that.

624
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,445
I was told prospects were grim
after the Lehman scandal.

625
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:38,484
Like you, I had no goals.
I was unnoticeable.

626
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,786
So it didn't bother me when I
got rejected.

627
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:46,759
In the interview for my current
job, a woman was ahead of me.

628
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,294
She self-promoted herself with
great confidence, and then,

629
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,630
she started crying
at the interview.

630
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,800
I was like, "oh please".

631
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,737
On my turn, the interviewer
didn't hear a word I said.

632
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,774
So I winged it and went
"blah blah blah"...

633
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:05,611
and got accepted. That woman and I
were the only ones who did.

634
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,914
It was Akane-chan.

635
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,819
Did I already tell you all this?

636
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,122
Maybe it won't work out.

637
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,626
What's the matter?

638
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,695
Maybe...

639
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:27,466
- it won't work out for me.
- Are you crying?

640
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,068
I won't get hired anywhere.

641
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,205
Maybe I'm useless.

642
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,108
Don't say that. You're doing
your best.

643
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,178
I went to a coffee shop yesterday...

644
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,247
there was a girl my age
working there, happily.

645
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,551
She was smiling, and sparkling.

646
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,221
She was talking about Macchiato
and stuff...

647
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,991
she looked super happy to be
working at that shop.

648
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,962
I was envious.

649
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,832
Will I smile like her someday?

650
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:04,203
You will. Besides, she probably
wasn't smiling for real.

651
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,672
Probably.
You know, it's for show.

652
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,441
You know, putting on an
smiley face for customers.

653
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,845
- I can't take it anymore.
- Don't give up!

654
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,316
I don't know how many interviews
you've had, but don't give up.

655
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,751
For crying out loud...

656
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,122
Hello, Sakama Distillery.

657
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,593
- I'm so sorry...
- What's the matter?

658
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,628
They want a tour of our
liquor distillery.

659
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,497
- You saw our home page?
- That's right.

660
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,700
- I'm sorry, it's out of date.
- Oh my.

661
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,536
What? Yutori-chan, why are
you crying?

662
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,571
It's nothing.

663
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,607
I'm so sorry, but we stopped
the distillery tours

664
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:44,243
at the end of March.

665
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,411
Mom!

666
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,114
She's all right, Midori-san!

667
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,651
Anyway, I'm sorry, we got no
tour for you.

668
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,586
Ah...

669
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,688
but we're already here.

670
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

671
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,031
Well... our Sakama Distillery

672
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,735
has been around 151 years, since
the first year of the Keio period.

673
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,570
I am the sixth generation
distiller.

674
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,406
I will explain the
distillation process.

675
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,509
Thanks.

676
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:23,148
Sorry to barge in
on you like this.

677
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:26,318
I said let's not, but those guys
wouldn't back down.

678
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,154
At the end of the tour, you
can sample our wine.

679
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,124
It's okay. Just a little
surprised, that's all.

680
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,859
Ah...

681
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,628
Let me introduce her.

682
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:40,465
This is Miyashita Akane-san,
the area manager.

683
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,200
Don't you mean, "girlfriend"?

684
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,671
Well, yes, but...
This is my sister-in-law.

685
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,739
Nice to meet you.
I am Masakazu's mother.

686
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,541
I appreciate your coming
to visit us.

687
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,278
Should I give her my
business card or is that weird?

688
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,615
Why are you acting
so awkwardly?

689
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,584
- This is your first time?
- That's right.

690
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,319
That's why I didn't
want to do this.

691
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,622
What I mean by that is...

692
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,858
I wanted to meet you under
more formally settings.

693
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:10,329
What a lovely lady. Isn't she?

694
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,798
I'm Yutori, his younger sister.

695
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,132
Um...

696
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,701
should I continue?

697
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:16,835
Oh. Sorry to interrupt.

698
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,370
I'm his older brother.

699
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,573
The filtered wine matures
in this barrel.

700
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,178
It's filled with wine.

701
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,081
It's full!

702
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,082
Wow.

703
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,750
That's different from
your usual.

704
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,719
It's filled with it.

705
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,622
Now let us begin sampling.

706
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,992
First, note the color.
Then the fragrance.

707
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,660
And then the taste.

708
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,996
Never mind all that,
just let me drink.

709
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,497
This is the sampling cup.

710
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,200
Do you see the blue
double-circles inside?

711
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,469
You gauge the transparency
with respect to the circles.

712
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,403
Pour it, old hag.

713
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,672
He didn't mean to say that.

714
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,910
Second is fragrance, and
third is taste.

715
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,179
You breathe with
your mouth first...

716
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,716
and exhale through the nose...

717
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,485
then you spit it out.

718
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,919
But I already swallowed it.

719
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,655
Sure you can drink it, but

720
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,658
you spit it out because taste
buds numb if you're tipsy.

721
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,292
Oh...

722
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,136
I swallowed it again.

723
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,804
Crap...

724
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,240
Sensei, may I sit next to you?

725
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,741
They all taste so good,
so I drank too much.

726
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,044
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

727
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,481
It sure feels good.

728
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,417
Are we still in Tokyo?

729
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,585
It's still Tokyo, though it's
at the very edge of it.

730
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,821
Where are you from,
Miyashita-san?

731
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,692
- I'm from Saga.
- What do your folks do?

732
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,327
How many siblings do you have?
What number in line are you?

733
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:53,165
Say, Moms. You have to be more
natural about stuff like that.

734
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,367
Masakazu.

735
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,337
Hey Maribu-kun, where'd
you get that?

736
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,339
I got it from the fridge.
Want some?

737
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,240
Aw man...

738
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,076
We got a gift from
Miyashita-san.

739
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,511
You should go to the hot springs.

740
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,613
Is it co-ed bathing?

741
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,382
It's only a 10 minute
walk from here.

742
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:13,318
Onii-chan, you should
drive them there...

743
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,153
Oh, he's drinking.

744
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:18,356
It's actually drinkable!

745
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,825
It sure is.

746
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,993
What's going on?

747
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:25,130
This was my brother's home-made
beer. It was utterly horrible.

748
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,799
It tasted like dishwater
wrung from a rag.

749
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,635
Maybe you drank it
before it matured.

750
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:33,772
Right?

751
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,341
Yup.

752
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:01,233
I thought you'd be feeling low
because you got disciplined...

753
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,802
but it seems I didn't
have to worry.

754
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,470
I did feel low at first.

755
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,175
Living in a distillery
near a hot spring,...

756
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,410
you've got nothing
to complain about.

757
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,280
It's not that simple.
Besides, I can't drink rice wine.

758
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,817
But your mom is kind...

759
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,153
and your little sister is cute...

760
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:27,926
Your brother and his wife run the
biz. What more can you wish?

761
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,028
There are lots of things.

762
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:32,364
Oh boy.

763
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:36,067
I haven't spent time with friends
on a day off in years.

764
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,235
Friends?

765
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,605
- Are we friends now?
- I wasn't talking about you.

766
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,607
Friends would be
more thoughtful.

767
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:46,878
That's right. They won't call you
on a weekend to trouble you.

768
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,215
Or worry that you'd have to make
excuses for them turning down.

769
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,485
In the end, we just keep in
contact through Facebook,

770
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,253
and actually never
meet up for years.

771
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:56,822
But we meet each other
3 or 4 times a week.

772
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,523
We're not friends.

773
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,326
- But 3 or 4 weeks...
- We're not friends.

774
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,634
What shall we do after this?

775
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:13,171
- My Mom's making dinner.
- What shall we do after that?

776
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,407
How about you, Yama-chan?

777
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,843
What am I doing?
I'm going home.

778
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:21,546
You should spend the night
someplace around here.

779
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,217
- I can't do that.
- But this is your chance.

780
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,218
No...

781
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,887
She still has two
weeks to go.

782
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,157
So what? Is she going to change
two weeks from now?

783
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,760
Is she going to shed her skin
or something? No, she won't.

784
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,429
So the time is now.

785
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,065
Just be quiet afterward for 2 weeks,
then you'll have the same result.

786
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,868
Come to my rescue
here, Sakama-kun.

787
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,837
Hey, did you power-harass?

788
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,506
What?

789
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:50,342
Did you say
inappropriate things

790
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:53,612
to your subordinate, put him down
and drive him to despair?

791
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,481
You didn't, right?

792
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:00,418
So why did you pay a penalty
and get disciplined?

793
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,054
Your subordinate seems to be
doing just fine.

794
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,625
Well...

795
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,526
it was the company's decision.

796
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:11,162
But you and your subordinate...

797
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:12,697
are both a part of the company.

798
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,201
Maybe you should be
more assertive.

799
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,605
Woops, sorry.

800
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,607
Well, we're not friends,

801
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,543
so I just gave you a
piece of my mind.

802
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,317
Ouch! Ouch!

803
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,318
Ouch...

804
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:34,953
Are you okay?

805
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,589
What was that for,
Akane-chan?

806
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,126
That really hurt!

807
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,161
Got you!

808
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,697
Are you okay?

809
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,333
I just can't keep up physically.

810
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,869
Keep up physically?

811
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:00,111
Incredible.

812
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:04,783
You can drink it now.

813
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:21,399
Thank you.

814
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:23,735
Guess I'll be going.

815
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,839
Hey! Riff raff. Wake up!

816
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,742
- We're leaving.
- I'll see you to the station.

817
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,510
We'll go too.

818
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,878
Oh man...

819
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:35,547
We're doing this for you.

820
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,649
No, please don't.

821
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,453
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you for everything.

822
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:44,589
- Please come again.
- Yeah.

823
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:46,925
Congrats for returning
to your job.

824
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,794
You weren't in the wrong.

825
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:50,762
Welcome.

826
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,030
The usual for me.

827
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,799
- Wait, make it a beer instead.
- Beer.

828
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,334
You should drink with us.

829
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,903
- It's a celebration.
- Thank you very much.

830
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:01,272
- Beer?
- The famous home-made brew.

831
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,275
Wow. Really?

832
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,114
"Sakama's Premium
Draft Beer"?

833
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,483
My older brother didn't heed the
instructions...

834
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:14,719
he had to let it sit a month before
cracking it open.

835
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,256
Thank you.

836
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,026
It's not that good, but if it's
chilled really cold it's drinkable.

837
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,961
Got it.

838
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:27,665
But you know, it's strange...

839
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:30,035
that my son and you

840
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,836
have become such
good friends.

841
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,338
We're not friends.

842
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,941
- Miyashita-kun.
- Yes?

843
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:40,545
Tell Sakama-kun to
pay a visit to the main office.

844
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:42,947
You two are dating,
aren't you?

845
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:45,884
- What?
- Was I wrong?

846
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,153
I heard you're
getting married...

847
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,994
Where did you hear that?

848
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:59,631
I don't remember...

849
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,276
What?

850
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:14,913
You go straight through here,

851
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,415
-then turn right at the first light.
-I see. Thank you.

852
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:30,929
Excuse me, sensei.

853
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:32,664
Which "sensei"?

854
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:35,033
Yamaji-sensei. No,
Sakura-sensei.

855
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,701
But first, Yamaji-sensei.

856
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,536
- "First"?
- Nevermind, come here.

857
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:39,604
Be quiet!

858
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:42,440
Be quiet!

859
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,743
Hey, are you "Yamamichi"?

860
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,750
- Yes.
- Listen to me you old geezer.

861
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:53,718
You been messing
with my woman.

862
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,954
G-geezer?

863
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,291
A change of plans?

864
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,128
Yamamichi equals virgin.

865
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,429
I'm out of luck.

866
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:05,830
Are you jealous?

867
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,633
Get out of here, scumbag.

868
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,701
You know him?

869
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,569
I want to change.
