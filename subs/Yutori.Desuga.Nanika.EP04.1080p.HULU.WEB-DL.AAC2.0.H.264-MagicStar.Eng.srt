1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,636
Is Yamamichi here?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,171
Answer me.

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,773
Where's the teach'
called Yamamichi?

4
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,074
"Teach"?

5
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,075
"Teacher", you mean?

6
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,112
Don't give me that crap.
Bring Yamamichi here.

7
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,646
Yes! Yes!

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,887
Sensei, please.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,489
Who are you?

10
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,257
No one without permission
is allowed in.

11
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,259
I got no business with you
guys. Where's the principal?

12
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,994
In the principal's office.

13
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,397
Hurry, hurry.

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,464
Who's the dean?

15
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,633
I am. What do you want?

16
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:35,436
My girlfriend is cheating on me...

17
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:39,006
with a teach' in this school
called Yamamichi.

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,476
They went to the hot springs
on Saturday.

19
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,445
What's going on?

20
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,514
Hey. Are you Yamamichi?

21
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,520
- Yes.
- Don't "yes" me, you geezer.

22
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,321
You laid a hand
on my woman...

23
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,157
G-geezer?

24
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,726
Shizuma.

25
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,130
You know him?

26
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,799
Be seated, please.

27
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,009
Why are you sitting next
to Yamamichi?

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,547
The name is written as
"Yama-michi", ...

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,714
but it's read as "Yamaji"!

30
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:21,882
Yes. I am Yamaji.

31
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,150
Why didn't you say so
sooner?

32
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,385
So you read my texts.

33
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,086
I read them. I saw them.

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,322
I have a right to read them.

35
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,326
Calm down. Come on.

36
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,228
What's your name?

37
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,364
Kogure Shizuma.

38
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,566
How old are you?

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,034
Nineteen.

40
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,136
He's a junior from my college.

41
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,573
In that case you should mind your
manners, Kogure-san.

42
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,341
No matter what the situation.

43
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,009
Who goes to his girlfriend's

44
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,078
- place of work and...
- What do you care?

45
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,014
I have to confront her in front of
this Yamaji bastard.

46
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,050
Or else she'll pretend to
not know what I'm saying.

47
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,952
When did you read them?

48
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,987
When did you look at
my cell phone?

49
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,822
While you were...

50
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,657
- taking a dump at the cafe.
- Stop that.

51
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,326
Shut up, virgin!

52
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,027
Shut up, virgin!

53
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,863
Shut up, virgin!

54
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,766
Shut up, virgin!
Shut up, virgin!

55
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,507
Did you hear me?

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,108
Shut up, virgin!

57
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:46,600
We're Millennials. Got a Problem?

58
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,005
Wait a second.

59
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,007
How does her younger
boyfriend

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,175
know that you're a virgin?

61
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,677
I'll explain it sooner
or later.

62
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,547
The only one who could have told
him is Etsuko-sensei, right?

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,282
So who was it that

64
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,983
told Etsuko-sensei, and when?

65
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,986
Can I, later?

66
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,521
Anyway,

67
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,490
according to Shizuma-kun,

68
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,092
while Etsuko-sensei went to
the powder room...

69
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,900
He unlocked the cell.

70
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,338
From '0000'?

71
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,776
He's an idiot, but he's obsessed
with her cell phone.

72
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,781
Etsuko-sensei was aware of
Shizuma-kun's jealousy.

73
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,784
That's why she changed
the lock code frequently, but...

74
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,652
on top of that...

75
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,221
she even deleted

76
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,024
all our texts to each other
frequently.

77
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,161
"Yamamichi"?

78
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,800
"I like... you, sensei."

79
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,736
Using the word prediction?

80
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,088
Thanks for waiting.

81
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,657
He restored her texts,

82
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,692
- one sentence at a time.
- Oh my, that's scary.

83
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,595
I can hear the theme song of
Mission Impossible.

84
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,365
It's incredible. I think only an
idiot could go that far.

85
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,467
While she slept, or while
she wasn't watching,

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,003
he'd repeatedly restore her
deleted text messages.

87
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:33,073
Then he reached a conclusion
that: "Yamamichi = virgin".

88
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,908
He's got abilities that are
comparable with an archeologist.

89
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,644
That would be more difficult than
decoding ancient tablets.

90
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,179
And yet why can't he read
the words 'Yamaji' correctly?

91
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,016
Because he's an idiot.

92
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,784
Anyway, Shizuma-kun

93
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,285
sat there till the end of school.

94
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,155
You can show me if you've
got nothing to hide, right?

95
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,890
Show me your cellphone.

96
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,926
You went to the hot springs
with her, didn't you?

97
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,863
We didn't go to the hot springs.
Our friend's home is a distillery.

98
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,698
- We all...
- Did you do it? With my woman?

99
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,033
Huh? Virgin teacher?

100
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,702
Whether he did it or not?
Is that the only possibility?

101
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,137
There's no other possibility.

102
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,638
What else could there be?

103
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,474
And if...

104
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,742
I did do her, then what?

105
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,077
Then it's obvious.

106
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,578
I'll make you sorry
you done did do it.

107
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,347
Your grammar is incorrect!

108
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,053
Let me say this...

109
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,522
I had no idea...

110
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,891
that you were in her life.

111
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,764
"You really don't mind?"

112
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,033
"No, I'm actually proud of you."

113
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,536
"I'm glad, I thought you might
think it was gross."

114
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,004
"I wouldn't, because I..."

115
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,772
- "What?"
- "I don't have experience either."

116
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,140
Huh?

117
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,142
You have no experience?
How could you say that?

118
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,977
Stop it.

119
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,679
She's experienced. She's
experienced plenty with me.

120
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:46,680
That's enough!

121
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,516
Do you understand now?

122
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,386
That means that Yamaji-sensei

123
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,021
did not lay his hands on
Sakura-sensei...

124
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,522
according to your words.

125
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,690
I guess so.

126
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,358
Then apologize.

127
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,428
You're on sacred ground: an
elementary school's faculty office.

128
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,731
You have profaned it with your

129
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,966
inferior emotional outbursts...

130
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,535
You've raised a fuss,
with utmost disrespect.

131
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,471
Apologize.

132
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,006
I am very...

133
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,675
sorry.

134
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,276
Etsuko-sensei.

135
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,112
Come on, bow your head.

136
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,447
Good job, Yamaji.
I'm proud of you.

137
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,348
You endured well.

138
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,016
Nah, nah.

139
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,352
Thanks. Thanks just the same.

140
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,389
But the dean scolded me
terribly after all that.

141
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,358
I never guessed you would come
out and tell her you're a virgin.

142
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,093
I figured I'd tell her first.

143
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,196
I thought I'd feel easier
if I did.

144
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,032
I wasn't ashamed of the
fact either, so...

145
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,567
The outcomes was
unexpected, though.

146
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,203
And it got announced to
the entire school.

147
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,006
Anyway, the word 'virgin' will
get trendy

148
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,942
in class 2 of fourth grade.

149
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,444
No doubt about that.

150
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,148
The kids might ask:
"Dad. What's a 'virgin'?"

151
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,150
How will parents answer them?

152
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,051
My dad said he's not
a virgin.

153
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,053
My mom's not a virgin either.

154
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,055
I heard it means you're not
fully grown up.

155
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,425
You can buy a movie ticket for
1,000 yen if you're a virgin.

156
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,559
Seriously?

157
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,494
That's awesome.

158
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,398
Okay everybody, be seated.

159
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,035
I think you all know,

160
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,271
but we in the 4th grade will
put on a play

161
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,506
at the Autumn Arts Festival.

162
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,742
So before we practice
for the preview,

163
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,011
we will announce the play

164
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:28,048
during Friday's parent-observation.

165
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,018
Okay, quiet.

166
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,187
Next, I shouldn't say this.

167
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,655
Huh?

168
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,323
Oh, yes.

169
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,692
Um...

170
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,661
What was I going to say?

171
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,963
I am in charge

172
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,532
of Sakura-sensei's
goodbye party.

173
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,203
Are you quitting, Sakura-sensei?

174
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,104
My promise was for
four weeks.

175
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,841
Stay one more week!

176
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,776
If I want to be a real teacher,

177
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,145
I have to first graduate
from college.

178
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,647
So I will go back to
college for a while.

179
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:01,715
Now...

180
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,051
regarding the play we'll
be announcing...

181
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,786
what would you like it to be?

182
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,421
- Star Wars.
- Death Note.

183
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,722
"Dangerous Cop".

184
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,857
We should do a play
kids can act in.

185
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,192
Then how about "Big Daddy"?

186
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,728
Quiet, everyone.

187
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,363
How about "Wizard of Oz"?

188
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,899
You want to play Dorothy,
don't you, Etsuko-sensei?

189
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,634
I will be in charge of the
musical accompaniment.

190
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,369
What about Yamaji?

191
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,738
The witch. You play the
witch because you're a virgin.

192
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,441
That's good.

193
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,077
Our relationship is out of the bag.

194
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,115
You know...

195
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,018
I'm interviewing with
Kotobuki Company.

196
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,219
Am I wrong?

197
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,755
I heard you were
getting married.

198
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,689
Yamagishi said that?

199
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,758
I think he's telling everybody.

200
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,197
That's when it was...

201
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,298
You sound glad. Why?

202
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,432
No, no.

203
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,433
This is a bad situation.

204
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,136
But I never had it under wraps
in the first place.

205
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,672
I think I've said it before,
but I'll say it again.

206
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,909
I want work and private matters
to be separate.

207
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,845
Sakama's girlfriend, Miyaji's
boyfriend, and so on...

208
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,848
I don't want to know such things
to bias my views of colleagues.

209
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,317
I don't want to know about
my weakness.

210
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,253
Weakness? Huh?
You mean to say that your

211
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,657
going out with me is a
weakness? Is it?

212
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,025
That's why!

213
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:23,597
If the store manager doesn't have
ambition, workers won't either!

214
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,898
Isn't that so, Murai-san?

215
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,900
Yes, I agree.

216
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,469
You have to show some
personality.

217
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,238
Or you'll never beat
your competition.

218
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,508
The number of stars in food blogs
aren't everything, but...

219
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:38,178
you need service that'll make
customers say:

220
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,514
- Koenji Tori-no-tami is different.
- I completely agree.

221
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,617
For example, ...

222
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,119
so customers will remember
our faces and names,

223
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,989
we could wear tags with nicknames
and individual message.

224
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,325
Like "Eternal work
leader: Murai".

225
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,060
"I can play the guitar."
Stuff like that.

226
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,530
Murai-san, please bring
Nakamori-kun here.

227
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,597
Oh. Yes.

228
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,133
Nakamori!

229
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,770
Anyway, let's let them think
we're just good friends.

230
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,006
What are we? Celebrities?

231
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,941
Is it more natural if we said
we've broken up?

232
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,010
Wait a second...

233
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,411
Thanks for waiting.

234
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,180
Sit! Sit!

235
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,115
What is it, area manager?

236
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,116
Are you frustrated?

237
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,351
Do you have a girlfriend,
Nakamori-kun?

238
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,519
Why are you asking me that,
store manager?

239
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,055
I'm not interested or anything,
I just...

240
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,157
We just broke up.

241
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,193
I see.

242
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,296
I said let's date over LINE, and
we were both excited, but

243
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,032
we had no time for each
other because of work.

244
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,601
Then she said:
"Let's break up" on LINE.

245
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,170
You haven't seen her since?

246
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,006
That's right.

247
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,408
You only dated on LINE?

248
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,343
Didn't you do "stuff" with her?

249
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,146
Oh. Yeah, we did
before we started dating.

250
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,949
"Stuff"...

251
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,384
You're funny.

252
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,451
Yikes!

253
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,686
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

254
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,388
- I...
- It's okay, really.

255
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,427
Give me the bill.

256
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,464
I've got a new job, I've
been so busy lately.

257
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,566
I've got to go to a meeting
now. See?

258
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,302
I'll leave a big tip; I won't be
here everyday anymore.

259
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,138
Is that so?

260
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,240
Will you miss me?

261
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,242
Not at all.

262
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,010
We had fun the other
day, didn't we?

263
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,548
How's your sister?

264
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,482
Store manager?

265
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,317
Same as you.

266
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,687
- Well, it's a girl's bar though.
- Huh?

267
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,656
But it's legit.

268
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,191
It's not a ripoff joint.

269
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,659
Come visit.

270
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,929
"Opening service:
40 minutes free of charge"

271
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,305
No way.

272
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,940
Welcome home.

273
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,910
You don't need to wave,
I know you're smoking.

274
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,011
You do?

275
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,449
Don't go in there.

276
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,684
Mother-in-law is depressed.

277
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,286
What, why?

278
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,388
She had a fight with
Yutori-chan.

279
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,858
The usual squabble; she says go to
interview and Yutori says no.

280
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,892
For goodness' sakes...

281
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:07,761
Hold it.

282
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,230
You can't go upstairs either.

283
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,965
Yutori-chan is crying up there.

284
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,574
Wait, wait, wait.

285
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,610
You can't go that way either.

286
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,511
What the heck?

287
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,513
My man is drunk.

288
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,484
He wanted to sell his
homemade beer...

289
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,519
but the workers weren't
interested.

290
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,422
He should've discussed it
with them first.

291
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:49,870
Hey.

292
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:51,938
Oh?

293
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,073
Thanks.

294
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,078
Are you in college?

295
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,513
I'm looking for work.

296
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,847
4th year in college?

297
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,116
Did you enjoy college?

298
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,051
So-so, I guess.

299
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,286
What about club activities?

300
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,989
I've been too busy
looking for work.

301
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,393
Do you have a boyfriend?

302
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,531
I've been swamped
looking for work...

303
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,431
so he dumped me.

304
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,533
I dunno...

305
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,570
sounds like you went to college
so you could go look for work.

306
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:28,175
Because what I asked you was:
How did you like college?

307
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,743
But all you talk about is
looking for work.

308
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,178
Everybody's like that.

309
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,812
That's only a part

310
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,514
of what goes on in college,

311
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,217
whereby if you don't look for
work, you won't find a job.

312
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,521
Anyway, thanks.

313
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,223
I'll wash this and
return it to you.

314
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,359
You're not crying.

315
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,397
I shouldn't have worried about you.
Go downstairs and apologize to her.

316
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,937
That man, Maribu; which college
does he go to?

317
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,805
Who is that guy?

318
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,307
Who is that guy...

319
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:01,942
a student on hiatus?

320
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:02,842
Seriously?

321
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,444
He said he's going to become a
doctor or a lawyer.

322
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,046
Although he's just a
storefront barker.

323
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,447
What? That's funny.

324
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,015
...and with child.

325
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,984
I forgot to say that.

326
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,356
Whatever the case, I think he's
had quite an impact on my sister.

327
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,227
Anyway, what's with
our area manager?

328
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,428
But you see...

329
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,131
isn't it more thrilling to see each
other covertly?

330
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,100
But the way she so thoroughly
keeps us a secret...

331
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,268
it makes me think:

332
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,671
"What am I to you? Am I
an embarassment to you?"

333
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,807
I'm not even sure we're
actually going out.

334
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,008
We don't have any
hobbies in common.

335
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,309
When we're together she plays
cellphone games,

336
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,410
and I'm watching videos.

337
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,779
People of Yutori's generation...

338
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,114
are lousy at dating.

339
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,515
She tells me not to
expect too much.

340
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,850
That's why, you see...

341
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,620
I don't feel like I'll lose to her.

342
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,787
What? Are you in
competition with her?

343
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,889
Of course I am.

344
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,260
My generation doesn't give up.
We're passionate.

345
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,227
You see...

346
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,397
my wife was seeing
another man.

347
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,201
He was the same age as you...
Yutori's generation.

348
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,303
And she told me that
he said to her:

349
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:07,941
"Let's wait till I get my accounting
license, to get married."

350
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,111
Now since I'm of the
passionate generation,

351
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,013
I took that opportunity

352
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,615
to use my money and time,

353
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,717
to get her back; so I went
all out.

354
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,786
Bouquets of roses.

355
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,824
A diamond ring hidden in
the bouquet.

356
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,662
A day trip to go eat
Shanghai crab.

357
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,599
It was one surprise
after another.

358
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,802
I got on my knees to her,
in the rain.

359
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,405
Wailed to her.

360
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,976
As a result, by the time the guy
would get his license...

361
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,245
she and I were with child.

362
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:53,019
If only Yamaji-kun had 1/100th
of your passion...

363
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,421
Speaking of...

364
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,524
it's a reservation from
Yamaji-san.

365
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,193
What, 4 hours?

366
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,864
- Yamaji-sensei.
- Sorry, I was checking something.

367
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,268
Regarding the choice of the
candidate to play Dorothy...

368
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,603
who made the decision?

369
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,272
I did.

370
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,307
I figured lots of kids
would want to play her.

371
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,776
Of course, it's the starring role.

372
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,911
Oh, don't get me wrong.

373
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,513
I'm not saying this because
my daughter wasn't chosen.

374
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,182
I told her myself.

375
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,184
To steal the spot light even
though you're playing side role.

376
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,485
But still...

377
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:29,522
How come the only part left for
her to play is the witch?

378
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,990
That's right.

379
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,594
She could have tried for the
fairy godmother role instead.

380
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,731
Why was Elen-chan
chosen for the lead?

381
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,366
Because her name sounds
like she's half caucasian?

382
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,135
No, it was a majority vote
on the 3 candidates.

383
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,305
That was the day Yudai-kun and
Asuka-chan were sick and absent.

384
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,439
No way.

385
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,241
Not everybody wasn't
there for it?

386
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,311
Ayaka-chan lost because
of 2 votes.

387
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,846
Well, well...

388
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,983
I don't want to suggest that
you do it all over again...

389
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,019
But can you call the two absent
kids and ask their vote?

390
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,390
They both agreed that
Elen-chan would be good.

391
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,225
Can you please reconsider?

392
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,761
What shall we do?

393
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:14,367
You chose the part yourself,
but you're going to turn it down?

394
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:18,638
I think she doesn't want to
act with Mori-kun, the bricks.

395
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,341
Why is my son playing bricks?

396
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,009
He's chubby, not flat.

397
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,112
Is it because my husband
works at a steel mill?

398
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,280
No, of course not.

399
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,549
- How funny.
- That's not it.

400
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,018
The Lion is far more chubby.

401
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,854
It's okay if my son plays
the Lion.

402
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,992
But can you change the name of the
play to "Lion King"?

403
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,296
He had the starring
role last year.

404
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,299
It's hard for him to
get motivated.

405
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:50,069
How come fairy 3 has more
lines than fairy 4?

406
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,771
Why is that?

407
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,607
There is no
particular reason...

408
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,843
In that case the line: "Defeat
the witch of the west!"

409
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,244
should be said by fairy 3.

410
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,145
Yes.

411
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,949
While we're at it, change: "That's
right, that's right", to fairy 2.

412
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,285
Why are you just sitting there
spacing out?

413
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,486
- Take notes.
- Oh. Yes. Yes.

414
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,755
Oh no. I feel like we're
monster parents.

415
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,156
We're not monster parents.

416
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,026
Real monster parents
aren't like us.

417
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,227
Anyway,

418
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,430
Yamaji-sensei and Sakura-sensei,
please do as you like.

419
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,899
How are we supposed to
do as we like?

420
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,302
You're right,
you're right.

421
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,673
If they wouldn't gripe so much,
I wouldn't be so vested.

422
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,809
I don't care if there are three
or four Dorothys.

423
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,278
I don't care if it's "Lion King"
or "Rip van Winkle".

424
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm sorry about
the commotion.

425
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,682
Listen to me.

426
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,517
Their own child may look
the prettiest to them...

427
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,853
But objectively speaking, some of
them are downright ugly.

428
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,754
No, no, you can't say that.

429
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,057
- It's such a hassle.
- Here's your orange juice.

430
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,926
Why don't you play the witch
since you're like a witch?

431
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,596
Those monster parents...

432
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,197
Yamaji-san.
Yamaji-san.

433
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,433
Let's change the subject
of conversation.

434
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,069
How's it going with
Etsuko-san after all that?

435
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,404
For now...

436
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,608
her internship is over.

437
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,651
All right. Go
take the last order.

438
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:15,822
From who?

439
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,526
I wish somebody would come.
I don't care even if it's Maribu.

440
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,734
"Sakama"

441
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,643
Welcome.

442
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,484
Why?

443
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,519
Did I give you my number?

444
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,155
I found this in my older
brother's pocket.

445
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:54,761
Seriously?

446
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,463
What the...?

447
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,532
Did I throw it away?

448
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,803
Can I shut off
the stove now?

449
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,405
Um...

450
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,510
Please do.

451
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,511
Welcome.

452
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,147
Such terrible timing.
Is it Maribu?

453
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,214
Welcome.

454
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,316
Hey there.

455
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,550
We're a party of four,
is that okay?

456
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,153
- We close at 11:00 PM.
- That's okay.

457
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,355
Sorry about this. We
were in the neighborhood.

458
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,893
I thought it'd be better to spend at
our own store rather than another.

459
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,329
We'll seat ourselves.

460
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,296
Welcome.

461
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,132
This is awkward.

462
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,133
He's the power-harasser?

463
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,201
Quiet, he'll hear you.

464
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,236
Let's just have a few
and leave.

465
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,643
Does your brother know
about this?

466
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,512
- No.
- Then you can't do this. Go home.

467
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,222
Do you have a resume?

468
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:02,261
Of course you have a resume.
You're looking for work.

469
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,198
Family background...

470
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,099
I know about that.

471
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,034
What you seek to accomplish...

472
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,203
"I aspire to contribute to the

473
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:15,074
new services and plans of
your company."

474
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,477
Thank you very much.

475
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,014
But you haven't made
any contributions yet.

476
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,348
What are you thinking?

477
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,516
I want to change.

478
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,450
At a girl's bar?

479
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,519
My pride...

480
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,087
my self-consciousness...

481
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,390
I have all kinds of people
telling me...

482
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,258
that I have no value
whatsoever in society.

483
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,327
I've lost my self confidence.

484
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,597
I want to put myself in a harsher
situation, and gain experience.

485
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,066
But just as you say,
Michigami-san...

486
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,468
all I've done the past 4
years is look for work.

487
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,738
Looking for work to work, then
get married, then have kids...

488
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,807
to live a life that is clearly
spelled out.

489
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,476
But I'm not even at the
starting line.

490
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,912
Even though I'm trying so hard.

491
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,181
Nobody gives me the
opportunity to work.

492
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,116
What kind of society
do we live in?

493
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,485
If I can't work, that means
they're telling me to die.

494
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,487
What gives them
the right?

495
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,991
All they did too was do internship
and get hired.

496
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,859
Whether that can determine if
they can function in society

497
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,528
Or whether they are
valuable human beings...

498
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,530
is a separate matter, isn't it?

499
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,067
Rather than having nothing,

500
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,936
exposing my chest
at a girls' bar

501
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,173
would be far cooler,
more valuable, and exciting.

502
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,178
I must say...

503
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,613
I don't get it.

504
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:30,016
But you're cute.
Of that there's no doubt.

505
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,530
Oh man, this is too much...

506
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,799
You're my friend's
younger sister so...

507
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,535
I should turn you down, but...

508
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,706
But Sakama-kun...

509
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,275
is not...

510
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,877
my friend...

511
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:02,215
therefore...

512
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,951
And bring me karaage.

513
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:08,121
Sorry, but that was the
last order just now.

514
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,155
Huh?

515
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,590
No one told me.

516
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,058
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,694
This is the last call
for alcohol too.

518
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,296
Why didn't you just
say that at the beginning?

519
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,066
I did say that we're
closing at 11:00 PM.

520
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:23,536
- Sorry about this.
- It's not your fault store manager.

521
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,672
Such bad attitudes nowadays.
How long's he been around?

522
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,242
I wanted to eat karaage.

523
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,278
He thinks he's rented the place
for his private party.

524
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,047
You can make stuff that don't
require a flame, like salad.

525
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:36,649
No... we can't.

526
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,152
Hey. We're having a private
party here.

527
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,153
I can't take it anymore.

528
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,855
Please. I'm really sorry.

529
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,031
Here's the check.

530
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,600
He's got something up
his sleeve.

531
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:59,038
The food was satisfying;
since it's from our company.

532
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,141
Thank you very much.

533
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,143
However,

534
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,112
you customer service...
needs improvement.

535
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,015
- Who the hell do you think...
- Thank you very much!

536
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:31,437
"Where are you now?"

537
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:46,819
Oh.

538
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,167
You're harsh.

539
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,938
Hey, thanks.

540
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,041
Oh...

541
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,312
- What's going on?
- Sorry, I just noticed the message.

542
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,881
I just saw that,
and texted you back.

543
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,482
I just saw it.

544
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:21,754
So you do it huh? Rock...
Rock...

545
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,823
Rock climbing.

546
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,691
- You haven't heard?
- I haven't.

547
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,827
- I didn't tell him.
- I see.

548
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,896
The height here is great.

549
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,999
Yes, the height here is great.

550
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,001
I never knew you did this.

551
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,870
Sure you wouldn't.

552
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,239
- But isn't it strange?
- What is?

553
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,108
You know...

554
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,743
weren't you with Aso-san?

555
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,746
Yeah, till 9:00. I wanted to
get some exercise, though.

556
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,115
That's right. So we just decided
to rock climb, right?

557
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,651
That's right, right?

558
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,085
That's what's strange!

559
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,125
Hey. Don't you think
it's strange?

560
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,394
Gosh you're stubborn.

561
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,129
That means you were seeing him
without letting me know.

562
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,831
- I wasn't hiding it from you.
- She just didn't tell you.

563
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:10,002
You've been exposed, but you
don't seem to care at all.

564
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,038
Want some?

565
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,707
Aren't you two being too friendly!

566
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,909
There's enough water
in there for two.

567
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,112
Huh? Huh?

568
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,982
Are you jealous or something?

569
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,685
No, no, no way.

570
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,653
Yamaji is out of the question.

571
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,923
Akane-chan is out of the question.

572
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,693
You can talk to me that way,
but aren't you being rude? Hey!

573
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:39,165
All I did was dicuss school matters
and my love interest, with her.

574
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,501
You can talk to Aso-san
directly about those things.

575
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,837
No, she is too radiant for me.

576
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,107
I get you! I too can talk
about anything if it's Yamaji.

577
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,445
Me too. I'm connected to
Akane-chan by friendship.

578
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,314
And Yamaji has a
feminine side to him.

579
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,351
Yet he's not female.
That's what's good about him.

580
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:02,321
Akane-chan you too. You're
masculine, but you're not male.

581
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,623
We could even take a bath
together without worries.

582
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:07,193
But that would be...

583
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,494
an unknown till we try.

584
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,064
I like you, Yamaji!

585
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:16,402
Are you two now beyond the
male-female distinction,

586
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,237
and best buddies that can talk
heart to heart?

587
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:21,974
You have a nice relationship now,
is that it?

588
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,311
What are we, celebrities?

589
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,247
"Witch of the west?"

590
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,449
"That's right. The
witch of the west."

591
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,451
"Defeat the witch of the west."

592
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:34,086
"That's right, that's right."

593
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,255
"I'll get you, Dorothy!"

594
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,189
"Who are you?"

595
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,626
Okay, rehearsal over. Get
ready for class.

596
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,031
- Let's do it after school again.
- Okay.

597
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,034
Studying switch: ON!

598
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,069
You're Yamaji's lackey.

599
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,707
As a person involved with
management...

600
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,045
I felt responsible to go see how
the shop was being managed.

601
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,148
As a supervisor...

602
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,152
I wanted to see how our business
is being run...

603
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:10,423
But that's the area manager's job.

604
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,959
- I'm sorry.
- You can't do whatever you want.

605
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,295
Yamagishi-kun.

606
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:20,599
I commend your initiative.
But let's stick to your own job.

607
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,203
You know, you had taken time off
because of you-know-what...

608
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,905
Were you planning on making
accusations again?

609
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,673
That's okay, Miyashita-kun.

610
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,075
You can get away with your
behavior

611
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,612
if you've proven yourself a valuable
employee; you haven't yet.

612
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,882
- Was that power harassment?
- No, a correct assessment.

613
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,350
That is all.

614
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,020
Get back to work.

615
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,727
Why don't you go and apologize
some time tonight?

616
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,197
Yes.

617
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,032
Welcome.

618
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,237
Did people at your office
talk to him?

619
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,238
I'm sorry.

620
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,641
- Can I kick him out?
- Please don't. I'm sorry.

621
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,443
Hey, Sakama-san.

622
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,213
Nogami-san.

623
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,048
This is a nice joint.

624
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:12,985
I invited him. He said he
wanted to come say hello.

625
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:18,524
Yamagishi-kun says he felt too
awkward to come here alone.

626
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:19,992
About yesterday...

627
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,228
I apologize.

628
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,964
Party of two, please.

629
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,370
Party of two!

630
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:35,407
I ... didn't...

631
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,444
What?

632
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,778
I ...

633
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:43,382
...didn't...

634
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,951
Sorry, I can't hear you
over the sewing machine.

635
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,253
Since that incident,

636
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:51,423
I haven't been in contact with him.

637
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,460
Oh. I see.

638
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,397
This once-in-a-lifetime
teaching internship...

639
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,500
I didn't want to let that turn it
into an unpleasant memory.

640
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,503
But it's too late.

641
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,441
I don't mind at all.

642
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:14,580
Even now, I like...

643
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,018
I'm glad you decided to be a teacher
and that I'm became a teacher.

644
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,488
I'm glad from the bottom
of my heart.

645
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,790
I'm sorry I deceived you.

646
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:31,463
I will not contact him until
my internship is over.

647
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,700
I don't know if I'll keep on
seeing him...

648
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,735
I'll think it over after the
internship.

649
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,254
Welcome. Party of two?

650
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,726
Party of two!
M-Maribu?

651
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,362
I'm going outside for a while.

652
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,031
She's a good girl,

653
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,033
so make sure she gets
on the last train home.

654
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,569
See you.

655
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,374
In a single night...

656
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,377
What?

657
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,279
I got sevice worth
500,000 yen.

658
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,616
Are you serious? That's
crazy amazing.

659
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,252
He's quite different from
yesterday.

660
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,821
Perhaps he's behaving himself
because he's with a client.

661
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:32,658
Or perhaps the area manager
chewed him out.

662
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,128
What do you say,
Sakama-san?

663
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,031
- Can you drink at work?
- Erm no...

664
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,168
- Just one cup.
- Atta boy.

665
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,737
Sorry. Thanks.

666
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,340
I was worried about you for a
while there...

667
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,042
thought you got fired
or something...

668
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,378
but you're doing splendid,
store manager.

669
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,980
- Thank you.
- Okay.

670
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,919
I don't know about the human
resources of a big organization.

671
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,455
But when you're drinking with me,
it's personal.

672
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,862
Sakama-san. About
Yamagishi-kun...

673
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,231
he is...

674
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,099
starting to understand
how it all works.

675
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,935
He wants approval, that's all.

676
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,039
We were that way too once,
weren't we?

677
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:27,713
But then again, you and I are
many years apart.

678
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,187
Only...

679
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,990
praising isn't the same as
giving approval.

680
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,893
You slap 'em.

681
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,862
You scold them. You
yell at them.

682
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:47,399
You punch 'em out. You make
them cry.

683
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:52,571
You apologize. You pick up their
check. You punch 'em out.

684
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,940
You lick their cheek.

685
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,212
All those things...

686
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,415
are part and parcel of
approving someone.

687
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:04,983
Isn't that how it is?

688
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,418
Yes.

689
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,755
I approve of him.

690
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:10,856
Leave him to me.

691
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,192
Hey there.

692
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,227
Give us another bottle.

693
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:18,163
One more bottle!

694
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:21,033
Can our store manager
drink rice wine?

695
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,435
- Yamagishi-kun.
- Yes. Yes.

696
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,404
- Has the last train left?
- The last train has gone.

697
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,705
- I see.
- No more trains.

698
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,906
Then I don't need my train pass.

699
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,041
We don't need the train pass.

700
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,377
Oh, I think we can get on that cab.

701
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,881
Excuse me.

702
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,583
Hey. It's gone.

703
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,017
Yamagishi-kun.

704
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,086
I can't find my shoe.

705
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,688
- Shoe?
- Yeah.

706
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,356
Thank you very much.

707
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,558
Got rid of that
old bastard.

708
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,060
Give me a freshly squeezed
lemon sour.

709
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:52,398
That guy went on and on
with his preaching.

710
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,236
What's your problem?

711
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,439
- Huh?
- Where you shown in?

712
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,574
To this seat?

713
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,377
You're supposed to sit down...

714
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,579
after you've been shown
to the seat.

715
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,915
And you place your order...

716
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,083
after they ask you
for your order.

717
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,451
Oh, Maribu-san,
he's a coworker, and...

718
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,019
You scumbag!

719
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:17,623
The world doesn't revolve
around your ego!

720
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,025
This shop is this man's
establishment.

721
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,061
There is such a thing as
social propriety.

722
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,566
Store manager!

723
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,569
Shimoyama-san.

724
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,172
Hello.

725
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,874
Sorry about today.

726
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,643
Don't mention it.

727
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,912
Yamaji-sensei.

728
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:44,316
A call from Inoue-san's mom;
absent due to a stomach ache.

729
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,586
What? Wait just a second...

730
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:50,923
Inoue-san...

731
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:51,924
- she was...
- A fairy.

732
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:54,660
Oh yes. The one with
increased dialogue.

733
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,562
- I need someone to take her part.
- Yamaji-sensei.

734
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,496
It's Saotome-san's mother.

735
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:01,033
I'm sorry, the doctor diagnosed
my daughter with a stomach ache.

736
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,000
What?

737
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,669
The witch? The witch
of the west has a stomach ache?

738
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,104
Goodbye, teacher.

739
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,975
We can't find somebody now,
there are too many lines.

740
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,110
Oh. I'm sorry.

741
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,779
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no.

742
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,314
I'm the one who
should apologize.

743
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,083
I heard a friend of mine
was rough with you yesterday.

744
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,619
- Was that guy your friend?
- My friend?

745
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,821
Friend. Yeah.

746
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,923
Yeah. He's a friend.

747
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,725
You'll sue me if
he's my friend?

748
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,127
You won't sue me?
You won't, for real?

749
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,629
I won't sue you.

750
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:31,830
Really?

751
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,565
Gosh, Yamagishi.

752
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,367
Your distancing is really off.

753
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,737
I want you to come with me.

754
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,953
I am Dorothy. I live with
uncle Henry

755
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,121
in Kansas in America...

756
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:59,024
Why did it start already?
Where's the witch?

757
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:02,194
Sensei. It's too late to
change anything now.

758
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,464
Tanoguchi

759
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,599
- Whose home is this?
- Whose home?

760
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,834
My mother's.

761
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,435
But the family name
is different.

762
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,038
- Then maybe she's your mother?
- Please don't kid around.

763
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,608
Her son dove onto the train
tracks and killed himself.

764
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,777
It was the morning you
ditched work.

765
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,045
What?

766
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,281
This isn't funny.

767
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,715
Yes.

768
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,289
It's this guy.
He's Yamagishi.

769
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,294
- Come in.
- What?

770
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,228
Come on.

771
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,529
We have come to see

772
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:41,266
the Wizard of Oz because we
want him to help us.

773
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,771
Please help me get back
to Kansas.

774
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,808
Please give me brains.

775
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,810
Please give me a heart.

776
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:53,946
Please give me courage.

777
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,415
Please make everyone's wish
come true.

778
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,084
All right, I will.

779
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:03,188
If you defeat the wicked,
wicked, witch of the west...

780
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,991
I shall grant you your wishes.

781
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,194
The witch of the west?

782
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,562
Woof!

783
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,197
That's right.

784
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,766
The witch of the west.

785
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,835
Defeat the witch of the west!

786
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,570
That's right, that's right!

787
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,778
It's the witch of the west.

788
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,919
Why you, Dorothy!

789
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:39,024
Give me your silver slippers.

790
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,829
That's the wicked,
wicked witch of the west.

791
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,897
She's a wicked witch who
bullies everybody.

792
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:49,835
Calling me 'wicked' is
to praise me.

793
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:58,143
I know! The witch can't
stand water!

794
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,879
Splash her with water!

795
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,581
Woops.

796
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,016
You're really going to...

797
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,206
I am glad...

798
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,442
that you are a good person,
Yamagishi-san.

799
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:37,616
Okay. Now I approve of you too.

800
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,686
What do you mean?

801
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,688
I don't understand.

802
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,289
It's nothing.

803
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,691
Let's go.

804
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,027
Come on. Eat something first.

805
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:51,663
Thank you.

806
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:55,033
- I'll help out too.
- Thank you.

807
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,868
Let's see...

808
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,604
Here's your apron.

809
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,240
I have a lot of food.

810
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:41,413
Okay, Dorothy.

811
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,483
Click the heels of your silver
slippers 3 times.

812
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,686
You will be able to go home
if you do.

813
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,664
Yes, so that's it.

814
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:04,102
The entirety of your internship
has now concluded.

815
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,237
Yes.

816
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,340
As of today...

817
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,409
we will say goodbye...

818
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:12,410
to Sakura Etsuko sensei.

819
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,246
All rise.

820
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,584
Ready...

821
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,087
One-two...

822
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:25,690
Sakura Etsuko sensei...

823
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:31,863
thank you for the month that
you had spent with us.

824
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,035
Thank you.

825
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,105
I'll take a look.

826
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,947
Thank you, everybody.

827
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:53,952
I promise to attend the
Autumn Arts Festival.

828
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,923
Until then, we will guard
Yamaji's virginity.

829
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,626
Okay, thanks. Thanks.

830
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,061
Yamaji-sensei.

831
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,897
I'm sorry I wasn't of
much assistance to you.

832
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,867
No, no, no.

833
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,540
I was truly lucky to have interned
in your class, sensei.

834
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,643
I look forward to working
together with you.

835
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,616
Well...

836
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,653
everybody in 4th grade,
class 2...

837
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:33,124
It's really goodbye to you all now.

838
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,196
What do you think
she meant by that?

839
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,533
She just meant she looks forward
to keeping professional distance.

840
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,035
But she said nothing about
professional distance.

841
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,404
How would I know?

842
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,006
Why don't you just phone her?

843
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,876
Shizuma-kun will get mad
and come to school.

844
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:53,812
In that case, forget about her.
Next!

845
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,853
Hey, what is this?
Are you crying?

846
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,622
I'm not crying.

847
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,257
You're crying.

848
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,626
I'm not. I'm...

849
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:10,362
No, no, no... it was chalk.

850
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,364
Chalk got in my eyes.

851
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,039
What am I going to do with
Ma-chan?

852
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,457
What?

853
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,060
Yutori came home later than
you last night, didn't she?

854
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,229
So what? Is that so?

855
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:47,866
It's been every night.
I hope she's all right.

856
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,435
Leave her be, she's not a kid.

857
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,238
Maybe I scolded her too much.

858
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,173
Maybe I put too much
pressure on her.

859
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,310
What? Is she asleep right now?

860
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,312
She's awake, you know.

861
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,480
Sister. Taste this for me.

862
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,215
Okay.

863
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,452
Yutori is helping with the house
chores; it's unheard of.

864
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,957
It's proof that she's lying to me.

865
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,061
This place is 7 yen
more expensive.

866
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,630
Let's buy from that other place.

867
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,003
Are you hungry?

868
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:45,824
No, no, no ...
what a lowly...

869
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:51,496
What college does Maribu go to?

870
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,031
Who is he?

871
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,405
Using the word prediction?

872
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:02,040
College...

873
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,409
College...

874
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,324
Beer.

875
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,461
- Welcome.
- I'll have the usual, with salt.

876
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,898
How's your sister?

877
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:27,899
That's funny.

878
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:30,235
Your sister is cute...

879
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:31,836
Thank you for waiting.

880
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,498
Excuse me!

881
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,074
Oh yeah... I don't have it.

882
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:11,543
What?

883
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,530
Thank you.

884
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,004
Good job.

885
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,524
She's got a part-time job!
A part-time job!

886
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:00,859
You're super funny.

887
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,660
She's a good actor.

888
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:03,661
All answers
are correct.

889
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,396
Is she pretty?

890
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,031
That shop won't last long.

891
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:08,233
I've been seeing her.

892
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,169
I've been quiet about it because
I'm still uncertaint.

893
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,570
Maybe we should
break up.
