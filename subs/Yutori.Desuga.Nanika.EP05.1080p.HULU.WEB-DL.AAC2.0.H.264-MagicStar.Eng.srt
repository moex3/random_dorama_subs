1
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,110
What?

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,911
Good job today.

3
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,158
- What is it?
- Nothing!

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,928
- I'm going.
- Have a nice day.

5
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,098
- Isn't Yutori in a good mood?
- What?

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,634
- You think so?
- She got to the second interview...

7
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,403
at the travel agency she applied to.

8
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,437
Hey, Midori.

9
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,305
What is it?

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,341
Wrap this.
I'm thinking of eating it tonight.

11
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,976
Then you've just said so:

12
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,444
"Wrap this for me."

13
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,347
I hear the ferility situation
isn't going smoothly.

14
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,985
Say...

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,952
Is that all?

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,591
Is that all you know about
Yutori's good mood?

17
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,894
- You know something I don't?
- Well, no.

18
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,495
But you know...

19
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,863
she came home late last
night too.

20
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,099
- Maybe she has a boyfriend.
- What?

21
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,568
I know you're concerned
as her older brother, ...

22
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,271
but don't worry.
After all, she's already 21.

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,772
If it could be a trigger
for her to get hired,

24
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,242
even if not by a first-rate
company; it would be great.

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,812
I wonder what kind of man he is?

26
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,614
What? Does she really have
a boyfriend?

27
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,517
I don't know. Oh,
I'm going out tonight,

28
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,119
to Korokke's dinner show.

29
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,189
So if you want to talk behind
my back, tonight's your chance.

30
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,263
Whoopsy-daisy.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,468
Okay.

32
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,450
- You want to stop?
- What, why?

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,451
I dunno, you know.

34
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,754
Maybe you've reached the goal
of your climb for today.

35
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,756
- It's okay if you want to leave.
- But going back...

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,392
just because we were
seen together is also...

37
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,696
- Huh?
- Ouch!

38
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,065
-Stop it.
-What?

39
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,200
You're misunderstanding me.

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,769
You misunderstood me,
I said.

41
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:19,306
I didn't... Okay...
Akane-chan...

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,241
You win, Akane-chan.

43
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,677
Oh, store manager.

44
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,981
I was just speaking with someone
from the main office.

45
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,617
I heard that you and the area
manager...

46
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,685
We've already broken up!

47
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,490
I was going to say, "are peers
from the same year".

48
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,094
Welcome, I'll show
you to your table.

49
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,729
Of course I want to see her.

50
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,198
But her contact number
was deleted...

51
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,367
right before me by her
younger boyfriend.

52
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,802
I have it.

53
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,907
- Etsuko-sensei's? Seriously?
- Yeah, we exchanged numbers.

54
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,475
That was when we went to
Ma-chin's home.

55
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,144
- Here.
- Erm...

56
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:58,812
It's okay.

57
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,682
- Then shall I text on your behalf?
-No, no.

58
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:03,450
No.

59
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,721
- Then I'll send her your LINE ID.
- No, seriously.

60
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,822
Please don't bother yourself.

61
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,859
I'll just...

62
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,563
take her number down for now.

63
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,269
Of course, I'm not going
to call her.

64
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,838
It's just that I won't recognize
the number if it's not saved.

65
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,775
Welcome.

66
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,880
- Draft.
- Coming right up.

67
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,782
You're getting the hang of it,
store manager.

68
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,119
- You think so?
- Your preparations are perfect.

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,156
You skewer the meat exactly
2 seconds prior...

70
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,024
to the customers
taking their seats.

71
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,859
But actually, you're
not supposed to.

72
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,263
- We grill after taking their order.
- I'm sorry.

73
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,533
I'm just saying you've got talent.
How many months has it been?

74
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,435
It'll be 2 months soon.

75
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,303
You've got talent.

76
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,972
- He's got it, right, Sujimori?
- I'm Nakamori.

77
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,141
We even have each other's
business phone numbers.

78
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,843
It's because of the superior
and subordinate thing.

79
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,278
Even if we broke up, my cellphone

80
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,514
will simple convert from
private to business-only.

81
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,217
- Are you breaking up with him?
- If I did, do you want to go out?

82
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,156
Oh, don't go all quiet on me.

83
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,593
I'm not interested in
virgins anyway.

84
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,918
That new place on the
name card you gave me...

85
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,322
I've was thinking
of going there...

86
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,593
You've got numbers in here of
people you'll never see again.

87
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:54,662
That's true.

88
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,964
You guys hold on to these
meaningless connections...

89
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,199
that's why you feel no
sense of danger.

90
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,737
That's true.

91
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,210
I've been saying "That's true"
quite a lot, haven't I?

92
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,880
Why did I suddenly
become effeminate?

93
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,215
- What, you're 38?
- Right.

94
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
You don't look it.

95
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,053
You look no older than 36.

96
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,422
Let's not go there today.

97
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,029
Why is that?

98
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:32,700
Um... there's a lot of traffic
out there...

99
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,637
It's kind of far from here.
Besides, it's not that much fun.

100
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,377
- Alright, let's go.
- No, forget it.

101
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,948
The address book should have a
function of automatically

102
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,718
deleting all contacts of men who
have no will to marry.

103
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,786
You want to get married?

104
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,091
Who said I didn't want to?

105
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,295
- Sorry.
- Look, look!

106
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,796
I got a call!

107
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,889
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

108
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,926
That's amazing.

109
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,362
Your virgin spirit has
evoked a response.

110
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,030
What am I going to do?
What do I do?

111
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,867
You have to answer it,
"Yamamichi"!

112
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,971
I don't wanna.

113
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,239
Okay, I'll answer.

114
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,574
"Etsuko-sensei"

115
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,943
Don't you dare answer
calls from her.

116
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,780
Idiot. "Yamamichi".

117
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,047
Virgin idiot.

118
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,050
- I'm sorry.
- What?

119
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,486
You thought it was Etsuko calling,
didn't you?

120
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,992
Too bad! Because
she is...

121
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,095
taking a bath right now.

122
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,165
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

123
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,633
You're a teacher, aren't you?

124
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,203
Don't you have any
common sense? Virgin.

125
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,240
Yes...

126
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,909
Yes...

127
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,610
What happened?

128
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,150
She's taking a bath.

129
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,654
I heard she's taking
a bath.

130
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,556
A bath?

131
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,942
- I'm home.
- You're late!

132
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,010
It's not midnight yet.

133
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,445
Is midnight your curfew?

134
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,614
I don't have a curfew.

135
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,815
Wait a second.

136
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,384
- What were you doing out so late?
- Visiting alumni members.

137
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,485
Alumni?

138
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,188
Y-you've been drinking!

139
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,958
- Kidding. It was a drinking party.
- Then say so in the first place.

140
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,194
- Mom said it was okay.
- Is that so? Is that so?

141
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,964
She told me to let loose once in
a while; she gave me 5,000 yen.

142
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,332
That's what I've heard.

143
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,467
But... but still...

144
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,135
Right, bro?

145
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,975
- Sit down.
- Sit!

146
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,253
Yutori.

147
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,626
It's been 3 months since
father died.

148
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,197
Mother is putting up a
cheerful front, but...

149
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,634
I think the last 3 months
were tough on her.

150
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,337
She looks young,
but she's over 60.

151
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,374
- She's a senior citizen now.
- What's this about?

152
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,643
- Be quiet and listen.
- You need to grow up.

153
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,144
Each and every one of us.

154
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,114
Our Sakama family now...

155
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,850
no longer has a navigator,
who was our father.

156
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,519
And yet we must plunge into
a chaotic world.

157
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,989
Yutori, your difficulty
in finding work.

158
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,759
Midori, your difficulty in
gaining fertility.

159
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,594
And Masakazu's...

160
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,301
just... chaos.

161
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,136
- What is this about?
- Be quiet and listen.

162
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,737
You guys, ...

163
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,739
just because I'm the oldest,

164
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,975
you all simply assumed...

165
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,677
that I'd automatically
become the heir.

166
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,612
We've never even
discussed it.

167
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,714
Are you sure you want me
to be father's successor?

168
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,150
I'll be the heir, sure...

169
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,687
The second oldest can be heir
too. But I'll do it though...

170
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,222
You could at least offer
to take my place.

171
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,224
- Although I won't let you.
- It's bedtime.

172
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,961
Hey, wait a second.
Masakazu...

173
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,065
So, in the end I have to
turn to the Rental Uncle.

174
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,768
- You're pretty.
- Stop it.

175
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,104
I see.

176
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,607
I can't discuss it with my family,
my girlfriend, my friends...

177
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,876
but I could with you, Aso-san.
Because I pay you,

178
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,846
you're not related,
and you give me a response.

179
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,082
Like I'm playing catch
by myself against a wall.

180
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,251
I get calm when I talk to you.

181
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,988
Your sister...

182
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,857
she works at my son's
bar, doesn't she?

183
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,960
So you and I are not
completely unrelated.

184
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,863
He takes my money, he
gets involved with your sister...

185
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,266
- "Gets involved with?"
- Oh, he didn't?

186
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,471
Huh?

187
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,507
"I love you"

188
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,976
- What?
- I dunno...

189
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,179
I feel guilty for having peeked
at my sister's cellphone.

190
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,483
I loathe myself for suspecting,
but also for hitting the mark.

191
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,386
but more corncerning yet,
are my sister's actions...

192
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,424
Oh, yeah...

193
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,026
- you must be worried.
- Yes.

194
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,629
Do you want me to check the
situation out for you?

195
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:06,166
- No, no...
- She doesn't know me.

196
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,468
Of course, it'll be a secret,

197
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,437
that you and I have met.

198
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,173
Sometimes I do receive

199
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,976
and accept such request.
To do detective work.

200
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,980
So describe her to me.

201
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,349
My sister?

202
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,918
I dunno... well...

203
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,922
She has a gloomy look.

204
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,727
- Gloomy?
- She's actually not gloomy.

205
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,629
I don't have a pic...

206
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,300
Well, there's a texting emoji
that looks like her, though.

207
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,336
Should I send it to you?

208
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,740
- Does she look like that?
- No, not like that.

209
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,476
Welcome. Welcome.

210
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,178
Where can I sit?

211
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,013
Welcome.

212
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,048
Welcome.

213
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,817
Good evening.

214
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,085
- You're Moe-chan?
- I'm Moe.

215
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,886
- You're cute.
- Thank you.

216
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,588
Oh, pardon me.

217
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,708
Good evening.

218
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:22,642
Good evening.

219
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,678
- I can explain our system, right?
- "Right"?

220
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,280
The 2,000 yen drink-all-you-want
course is for 40 minutes.

221
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,749
It's 1,000 yen for every 15 minute
time extension.

222
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,185
But it's better value than ordering
a glass at a time. Is that okay?

223
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,722
- Well, let me see...
- What drink would you like first?

224
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:39,059
A drink? Let's see, what
should I have...

225
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,894
I already opened a beer.

226
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,933
So is it curry flavored garbage,

227
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,102
or garbage flavored curry.

228
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,905
Isn't that the same thing?

229
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,342
Then how about...

230
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,878
garbage flavored garbage?

231
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:58,979
Then that would be...

232
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,481
nothing but garbage.

233
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,251
I've never gotten along well
with older people...

234
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,188
but I could totally get along
with you, Aso-san.

235
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,225
Oh, how cute. You're blushing!

236
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,395
Why are you smirking like that?

237
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,898
How was my sister doing?

238
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,602
Well, her shift is twice a week.

239
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:26,273
She works from opening till
10:30 for 1,200 yen per hour.

240
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,141
And her nickname is...

241
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,210
here it is.

242
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,679
It's "Milla".

243
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,051
I wonder if it's Milla,
as in Milla Jovovich.

244
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,755
Why...

245
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,523
What made her so sad?

246
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,424
"Milla"

247
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,393
Sad enough to work at a
place like that?

248
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,527
About that...

249
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,865
It seems, it was her
own wish to do so.

250
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,401
In this world, there are people who
die unnoticed...

251
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,835
There are lots of
things you can't do,

252
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,439
places you can't go,
people you can't meet.

253
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,708
You and I are in the same boat.

254
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,612
We have infinite choices, but we
chose to be here at this time.

255
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,847
That is why I want to take
pride and

256
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,317
responsibility for the
choices I made.

257
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,986
I want to take pride and
responsibility

258
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,756
in working for a company I chose;
a company that in turn chose me.

259
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,360
I don't want clients who chose that
company to have regrets either.

260
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,796
Out of the many travel agencies...

261
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,631
I want them to be glad
they chose us,

262
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,000
and to make it a trip
they'd never forget.

263
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,470
I did it! Mother!
I passed the second interview!

264
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,340
I'm so glad. I'm so glad.

265
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,775
Let's go tell your father.
We must inform him.

266
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,149
Hurry.

267
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,457
That's awesome.

268
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,425
Congrats.

269
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,727
Huh?

270
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,962
I'm not doing anything special.

271
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,898
I have you to thank,
store manager.

272
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,500
That's why...

273
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,770
to congratulate me,
please go out on a date with me.

274
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,971
What?

275
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:06,840
Me?

276
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:10,777
Yes. I feel that if you did, I'd be
energized for my final interview.

277
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,212
Well...

278
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,381
Is that okay?

279
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,216
I think it's okay.

280
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,884
Then, tell you what.

281
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,388
Only after you talk
to your brother,

282
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,023
and tell him you're
working at my bar.

283
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,294
I see him every day, you know.

284
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,796
But I just can't bring myself
to tell him.

285
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,899
- He's here. I'll tell him now.
- Seriously?

286
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,511
- Who was that?
- Just a friend.

287
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,782
I'm taking a bath.

288
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,956
Wakayama Daigo-kun.

289
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,593
He has moved here because of
his mother's job.

290
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,195
Starting today,

291
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,698
he will be studying with all of you.

292
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,965
Be a friend to him.

293
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,401
Applause.

294
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,772
I want him to take classes in
the same classroom as his peers.

295
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:13,974
Well...

296
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,343
if he did that...

297
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,546
it would help to clear the kids'
misunderstandings

298
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,514
on learning disabilities, but...

299
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,386
How was he at the
previous school?

300
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,420
Yes.

301
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,357
He couldn't keep up with his
classmates in math.

302
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,259
So he received private lessons
in a separate classroom.

303
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,963
However, it made him
feel alienated.

304
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,932
He became slightly adverse
on attending school...

305
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,567
Our textbooks are different!

306
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,435
No kidding.

307
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,305
Let me see.
Let me see.

308
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,741
Wow! It's completely
different!

309
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,309
I understand.

310
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,779
In that case, he should
study along with the class.

311
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,148
I'm glad.

312
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,850
Well, we makes arrangements

313
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,853
to help him keep up,
like giving him extra lessons.

314
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,187
Thank you very much.

315
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,656
It is nice to meet you.

316
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,725
When did the cancel notice
come in?

317
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,861
Friday last week.

318
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,430
- It was Wednesday.
- Which was it?

319
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:11,965
It was Wednesday.

320
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,902
Which ever the case, you
should've reported immediately!

321
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,504
Why didn't you
tell me till now?

322
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,374
Something told me...

323
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,209
that the timing wasn't right.

324
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:27,480
I don't care about timing! Do you
know how much reception costs?

325
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,349
Oh, senpai.

326
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,350
Are you power
harassing?

327
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,852
No, no. Please,
give me a break.

328
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,222
Oh, senpai.

329
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,059
I can relate now to how
you must feel.

330
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:43,530
I have no idea what these
entitled monsters are thinking.

331
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,733
If only I had confirmed...

332
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,735
You think crying will solve
the problem?

333
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,171
That works only in the first year.

334
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,773
Hey. Hey.

335
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,210
I think you have gotten the hang
of working at the shop.

336
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,045
Yes, thanks to your support.

337
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,917
I hear sales have gone up.
You were fit for the task.

338
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,585
Nah.

339
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,855
Well, it would be nice for you

340
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:12,559
to come back to the office and
apply your energies here, but...

341
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,427
can you wait just a
little while longer?

342
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,464
Um...

343
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,899
Yes.

344
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,902
Are you disappointed?

345
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,737
No, no.

346
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:30,310
I'm so sorry, but Suginami,
Setagaya is starting to take off.

347
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,546
You know, the area manager
is going to change too so...

348
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,983
- What?
- Huh?

349
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,553
Didn't she tell you? Miyashita-kun
will probably get moved.

350
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,024
Sorry about that.

351
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,728
Oh, as your peer, she
probably found it hard to tell you.

352
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:49,963
Um...

353
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,732
There's a plan underway
to install a branch

354
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,934
at the giant shopping mall
in Sendai.

355
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,938
And Miyashita-kun has
been picked for a post

356
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,840
to be in-charge of the development.

357
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,843
They wanted to integrate women's
perspectives;

358
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,347
she'll be supervisor of the
Sendai branch.

359
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,948
It's definitely a promotion.

360
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,654
- Where's Daigo?
- In the school infirmary.

361
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,690
He raised his hand to answer a
division problem, so I picked him.

362
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,693
Then he slumped down in
front of the blackboard.

363
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,229
I see. I'm sorry
for the trouble.

364
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,531
It's okay.

365
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,967
I hope I didn't
overwhelm him.

366
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,302
Let's hurry.

367
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,004
Don't walk...

368
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,139
- The shoes..
- Oh no, I mean, don't run.

369
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,611
4... 9...

370
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,651
Could the answer be 6?
Think carefully.

371
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,818
Okay...

372
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,356
try it again on this paper.
Take your time.

373
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,696
Do your best.

374
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,898
So close!

375
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,735
Don't tell him.

376
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,239
Daigo-kun, you can do it!

377
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,574
Do your best!

378
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:12,979
Okay...

379
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,948
you answered every
question correctly.

380
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:21,187
You did it!
You did it!

381
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,923
Congratulations!

382
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,894
That's amazing!

383
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,098
Well done!

384
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,467
Oh no, please...

385
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,439
- His mom comes to school daily?
- Not daily.

386
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,140
Only for math class.

387
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,842
Learning disability, eh?

388
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,711
Did kids have that when we
were in school?

389
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,446
Nobody noticed, that's all.

390
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,948
It's an educational awareness
of the millennial generation.

391
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,251
People realized that effort
alone is sometimes not enough.

392
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,687
It's not bad being a
millennial, I must say.

393
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,755
And...

394
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,057
is she pretty, his mother?

395
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,893
Huh? What's that got to
do with anything?

396
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,130
Because Daigo-kun is all you've
talked about today.

397
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,466
You know...

398
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,102
she's a single mother, right?
Sounds perfect.

399
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,336
Come on...

400
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,006
I'm not a teacher so I
can find marriage prospects.

401
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,375
We've got parents from college
students to more senior guardians.

402
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,977
- A broad range is good.
- Don't be silly.

403
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:21,047
You're late, Akane-chan.

404
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,683
- Aren't you working?
- I here to try it out.

405
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,691
Hey.

406
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,260
Hey, hey, you can't just
crawl your way up there.

407
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,561
That's right.

408
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,730
You have to follow
the colors.

409
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,133
If you choose green, you
keep following the green.

410
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,300
Follow the color!

411
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,169
- Which one?
- To your right.

412
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,338
- Which one? This one?
- On the right.

413
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,342
You were warned.

414
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,917
Welcome.

415
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,385
Welcome.

416
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,653
What?

417
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:01,654
Store manager?

418
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,624
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- You're not all right.

419
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,694
He tore his Achilles' heel.

420
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:12,298
It's not torn. Not torn completely.
If it were, it'd be far worse.

421
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,133
I'll be fully recovered in a month.

422
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,135
Store manager,
what are you doing?

423
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,938
Here's your first order.
With sauce, right?

424
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,406
Oh.

425
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,109
Here's your salted order,
thank you for waiting.

426
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,811
Okay, one order of skins.

427
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,112
One order of skins.

428
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,880
And rice vinegar too.

429
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,515
- Hey, Nakamori-kun.
- Yes.

430
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,751
Clear table 2's pitcher and
take their refill order.

431
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,586
- Yes.
- Amazing, not a waste a moment.

432
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,554
Same order, okay.

433
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,489
I've got skewers too for
table 5.

434
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,623
All right.

435
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,394
The area manager is a
charimatic worker.

436
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,362
It's ready to go, Nakamori.

437
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,464
Okay, sorry.

438
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,998
Please take a seated at
the back table.

439
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,467
Welcome.

440
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,968
- Good job.
- Good job.

441
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,970
- Good job.
- Good job.

442
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,847
What are you doing?

443
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,149
What do you want to do?

444
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,519
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,756
I told you, there's nothing going on
with me and Yama-chan.

446
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,691
We're friends.

447
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:15,228
We climb, come down, talk.
That's all we do.

448
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,363
- That's a lot of things.
- You think so?

449
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,968
Don't you go 3 or 4 times a week?
Is it so much fun, this

450
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,770
- Ro-ro-ro....
- Rock climbing.

451
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,837
Rock climbing.

452
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,607
You don't even look at me
when I talk to you.

453
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,208
Because we're at the workplace.

454
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:32,044
But you go immediately after work
to that ro-ro-ro...

455
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,147
- Ro-ro-ro-....
- Rock climbing

456
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,549
- I can do it too!
- And you got injured, remember?

457
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,718
Even I have things I want to
talk to you about!

458
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,154
- What about?
- Never mind.

459
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,926
That's the part about you...

460
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,862
about people going out...
a presumptuousness?

461
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,332
I don't need that in my
life right now.

462
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:57,503
You got things you want to talk
about? Then talk!

463
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,673
"Never mind"?
What are you, a child?

464
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,842
You should've realized before
you tore your Achilles' heel.

465
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,779
That kind of...

466
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,682
egocentrical hubris.
Yama-chan isn't like way.

467
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,820
He's my friend. I can talk to him
about anything, with ease.

468
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,091
But look at you.

469
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:24,797
You're less than a lover. Less than
a friend. Just a subordinate.

470
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,969
I heard you got hurt.

471
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,805
Sorry. I should've let you know
I was coming.

472
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,473
It's fine, fine.

473
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,476
We're almost done.
Wait outside.

474
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,183
Hey...

475
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,190
Did the main office
call you in today?

476
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,294
- What?
- You're going to the Sendai branch.

477
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,130
That's awesome. You're going
higher up the corporate ladder.

478
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,901
Which pushes our marriage
further and further away.

479
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,106
I've been quiet because
I'm still uncertain.

480
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,140
What about Yamaji?

481
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,045
I told him.
Because we're friends.

482
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,817
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to be frank.

483
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,322
I would've gone to Sendai
if I weren't seeing you.

484
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,424
In fact, I want to go.

485
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,261
It's my chance to
test my abilities.

486
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,765
But I also think it's time for me
to draw a line.

487
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:37,603
and I also wonder if I'm too
dedicated to the job.

488
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,639
Also, it's going to get harder
and harder to quit it.

489
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,841
Not to mention my parents...

490
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:44,877
never mind that part.

491
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,049
Anyway, if there's a reason
why I wouldn't go...

492
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,720
it's could only be you.

493
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:10,303
In that case...

494
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,941
Just a sec.
Just a sec.

495
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,509
I think I already know
what you're going to say, but...

496
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,019
Go ahead.

497
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,425
Should we break up?

498
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,364
So that was it.

499
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,733
Huh?

500
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,106
Sure.
Okay.

501
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,476
Understood.
Let's break up.

502
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,656
Oh well.

503
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,461
Everything is finished.

504
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,509
You mustn't break up,
Masakazu-kun.

505
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:31,944
Definitely not.

506
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:36,482
- You keep saying that.
- I don't break up relationships.

507
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,050
Go outside for a while.

508
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,885
I can't, the baby will cry.

509
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,187
I'm sorry, ma'am.

510
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,688
Maybe she wanted...

511
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,024
me to ask her to marry me.

512
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,592
Maybe she was just
feeling pent up.

513
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:47,560
She's moving to another job.

514
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,564
She talks as if I'm an obstacle
to her promotion.

515
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,766
She didn't say it
like that to me.

516
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,403
Maybe the baby is hungry.

517
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:58,904
Baby just ate.

518
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,106
She said it was her work...

519
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:02,942
that was the obstacle to
marriage.

520
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,610
Which is it?

521
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,112
Both are truth.

522
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,046
Don't interrupt.

523
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,615
All the men
are mistaken.

524
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,485
Women do not want
men to make all decisions.

525
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,688
Marriage, work: she will
make her own decisions.

526
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,590
Men do not
need to decide for her.

527
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,426
Men must make women
happy, that is all.

528
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,363
When she puts it like that,
I have no choice but to be quiet.

529
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,499
She's talking about a
global standard.

530
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:27,633
How long has missus
lived in Japan?

531
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,935
She's Japanese.

532
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,270
No, seriously.

533
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,271
Her name is Yuka.

534
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,774
In other words, if I am
unsure I can make her happy,

535
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,175
I should not ask
her to marry me?

536
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,145
That goes...

537
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,679
without saying.

538
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:43,349
You pronounced that wrong.

539
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,384
This guy is preying on your sister.

540
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,319
This guy is preying on your sister.

541
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,555
-Wh-what did she say?
-I dunno.

542
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:52,291
He is preying on your sister,
so be careful.

543
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,860
He is preying on your sister,
so be careful.

544
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,462
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yes.

545
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,597
Like I said, ask me anytime.

546
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,500
It'll cost over 10,000 yen
to ride a taxi home.

547
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,269
The first train
will depart shortly.

548
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,604
Okay then.

549
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:10,209
You know... I know
the timing is weird, but...

550
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,778
how's your sister?

551
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,048
Why?

552
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,683
Just wondering.

553
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,458
Why doesn't he tell me?

554
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,962
Oh... nothing.

555
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,199
Please take good
care of her as usual.

556
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,502
Miyashita-san says she
can talk to you about anything.

557
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,470
Like I said, you can't.

558
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,977
Please. Climb the rocks,
come down, and talk.

559
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,012
That's all you have to do.

560
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,180
All right.

561
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:53,319
Hey, are you going
to be okay?

562
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,193
Masakazu-kun.

563
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,965
But I'm not capable of making
Akane-chan happy.

564
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,002
Because the person able
to make her happy is...

565
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,817
Excuse me, sir.

566
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:27,319
Please don't disturb
the other customers.

567
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,388
I'm sorry.

568
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,071
Sir. Sir.

569
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,540
Um... what is
the matter?

570
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,042
I'm sorry.

571
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,879
I'll take a taxi home.
I'm sorry.

572
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:59,752
This might sound strange, but...
thanks to Daigo-kun,

573
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,554
the class has become
unified as one.

574
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,291
That would be nice.

575
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,861
So you needn't
worry about him anymore.

576
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:10,596
What?

577
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,431
Am I a bother?

578
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:16,068
No, absolutely not.
I'm glad you're here.

579
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,069
I thought you had to work.

580
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,438
I work at night, so
it's all right.

581
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,307
I see.

582
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,642
By night, I mean...

583
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:29,815
something perhaps a little different
from what you are imagining.

584
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,086
Somebody is coming.

585
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,221
Yikes.

586
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,957
Etsuko-sensei!

587
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,964
She was an internship teacher.

588
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,666
She's so popular.

589
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,002
I missed you all,
so I dropped in.

590
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,604
Is everybody doing great?

591
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,140
Yes!

592
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,710
Oh yes, the DVD.
"The Wizard of Oz".

593
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,945
I burned a copy for you.
One moment please.

594
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,647
Sure.

595
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,683
He went away.

596
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,419
Murai-san, check please.

597
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:10,255
- Thank you very much.
- Table number 4 please.

598
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,959
Did I say 'sauce'?
I meant 'salt'.

599
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,228
- Just a second, it's almost done.
- I appreciate it.

600
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,466
- Did they break up?
- Were they really going out?

601
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,502
It's unclear, so it makes
things awkward.

602
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,070
Welcome.

603
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,109
I'm taking the place of an
injured subordinate.

604
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,345
- Have you been well?
- Yes, thanks for asking.

605
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,584
I'm sorry you always have
to dress up so strangely.

606
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,319
- Huh?
- At the bar.

607
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,522
- Not at all.
- Where shall we go eat?

608
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,625
Anything other than yakitori.

609
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,861
All right!

610
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,063
Oh yeah.

611
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:56,001
Here. Thanks.
It's been washed, too.

612
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,004
I see that.

613
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,673
We did it.

614
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:04,710
- You sure did.
- We sure did.

615
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,178
That was so funny.

616
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,646
It was funny.

617
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,749
I'll take the empty glasses.

618
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,085
This one's so cute.

619
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,853
This one wearing the root.

620
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,688
Thanks.

621
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,861
Muto-kun is so good.

622
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,233
I think I'm not going to
be a teacher anymore.

623
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:34,239
I'll get my certificate, but I'm not
taking the employment exam.

624
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,977
I wanted to tell you the truth,
Yamaji-sensei.

625
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:42,381
Even though you had counseled
me well. I am sorry.

626
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,988
- Why?
- My one-month internship...

627
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,124
was very meaningful.

628
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,961
Every day was fun, laughing
and crying with the kids.

629
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,063
However...

630
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,099
it's true that it was also tough.

631
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,770
I slept less so I could study.

632
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,441
But it still didn't go well. So I
cried. Self-reflected.

633
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,377
I didn't know what was
correct anymore.

634
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,215
I thought to myself: Will it
go on like this the rest of my life?

635
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,016
When I thought that
I came to realize...

636
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,720
that I couldn't do it.

637
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,590
Thank you very much.

638
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,960
It doesn't excite me anymore.

639
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,530
I think I burned out.

640
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,333
An unreachable place...

641
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,804
As your teacher, I...

642
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,173
don't think I was very good...

643
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,108
I broke up with my boyfriend.

644
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,416
He raised such a fuss, but he
cheated on me without a hitch.

645
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,687
That wasn't the only reason,
though.

646
00:35:56,588 --> 00:36:00,259
He was younger
and he was childish.

647
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,566
I've been doing all the talking.

648
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,102
I'm sorry.

649
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:15,340
Here.

650
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,009
Thank you very much.

651
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,511
I don't get excited either.

652
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:20,512
What?

653
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,015
About what you were saying.

654
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,352
Every day I think I can't
do it anymore.

655
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,988
There are students I like,
and students I don't.

656
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,225
There are obnoxious colleagues
and parents, I can tell you.

657
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,295
There are people I'd rather not see.
But I still go on teaching.

658
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,863
Even a guy like me.

659
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,898
I spent 4 hours doing division
with Daigo-kun,

660
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:43,302
the learning-disability boy.
I get so frustrated I want to cry.

661
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:46,171
A lifetime of it is impossible.
A single day a best.

662
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,306
But I still go on.

663
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,184
Why are you so quiet?

664
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,555
Why don't you fight back?

665
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,596
You fought back, remember?

666
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,499
When you were interning. When I
disagreed, you cried and left.

667
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,002
Gosh you were goofy.

668
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,106
- I'm sorry.
- It's not a matter of sorry.

669
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,749
Uh...

670
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,920
I too am sorry.

671
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,056
I'm drunk.

672
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,166
But I sure wanted you to become a
good teacher, Etsuko-sensei.

673
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,270
Please don't call me 'sensei'.
I'm no longer a sensei.

674
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,740
Nope, you're sensei. I call
you that even if you quit.

675
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,174
The rest of my life...

676
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,476
Along with all the children...

677
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,779
I felt like I was one of your
students too.

678
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,382
They all said today:
"Etsuko-sensei!"

679
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:07,486
I wanted to run toward you too,
with the children.

680
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,488
I wanted to embrace you.

681
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,226
You can.

682
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,863
That's not what I mean.
What I meant was...

683
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,636
And? Did you hug her?

684
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,072
Of course I did...

685
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:28,840
No you didn't.

686
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,777
I was watching. I stopped the
ventilator and watched.

687
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,891
After all that hesitation...

688
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,593
He shook her hand.

689
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,962
And then patted her head.

690
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:54,166
That's gross, Yamamichi.
Gross.

691
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,736
I could tell you're a virgin
even through the ventilator.

692
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,939
Hey, don't talk that way to a
customer. And how did you know?

693
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,543
The youth today are a joke.

694
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,046
"Burned out" after a
one-month internship?

695
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,815
What a joke!

696
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,317
I agree. But there
are many like her.

697
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:16,588
A teaching certificate is
advantageous to finding employment.

698
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,524
But the one teaching
is doing it seriously.

699
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:20,792
Even the kids...

700
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:23,795
want their teachers to become
good teachers.

701
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,197
I dunno...

702
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,800
I just couldn't keep quiet.

703
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,236
You weren't wrong.
You weren't wrong.

704
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:34,306
Store manager, can you stop
the ventilator now?

705
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,608
Oh, you can't reach it?

706
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:50,989
What's the matter?

707
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,824
Maribu-kun.

708
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,194
He didn't come today.

709
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,897
When's it coming off?

710
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,199
- Huh?
- The cast.

711
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,635
I was told one month.

712
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,406
Hey, um...

713
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,808
What?

714
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,982
<i>M-R Grand Prix Buffet's
Kotoge had an electrifying wedding.</i>

715
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,651
Seriously?

716
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,620
Don't, we're watching.

717
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,689
<i>His partner, a regular woman,
according to a blog,</i>

718
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,359
<i>is four-months with child.</i>

719
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:30,862
<i>Many congratulatory comments
were made.</i>

720
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:34,566
Midori-san, this tofu is delicious.
I love it.

721
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,568
It's the one we always
buy at the co-op.

722
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:41,039
Munetaka. What happened to...
you know, the bank thing...

723
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,208
I'm done eating.

724
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:51,249
Why don't you just act normal?
You make her self-conscious.

725
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,518
Ridiculous. They talk of
some regular woman,

726
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,620
but everybody knows she's
not a regular woman.

727
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,389
You can't fool the public.

728
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,857
You make me sick!

729
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,427
- Yutori!
- You're the worst!

730
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,396
I'll kill you if you touch my
cellphone ever again!

731
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,332
- You stop right there, Yutori!
- What's the matter?

732
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:10,902
She confessed. Finally confessed!
She has a part-time job!

733
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,571
A part-time job? Where?

734
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,539
- Well...
- What kind of part-time job?

735
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,808
Well, I don't know the details.

736
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,678
- What are you talking about?
- But that's not all!

737
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,781
- She's... with a guy at the job...
- Are they dating?

738
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,616
I don't know the details, but...

739
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:28,353
She's not a child. She can do
what she wants.

740
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,057
- But she's job hunting...
- She's getting inspired.

741
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,025
That's why she passed
the interview.

742
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,396
Don't spoil my morning with
with such petty concerns.

743
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,606
Okay... okay...

744
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,247
Sorry, I haven't had the
time lately.

745
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,052
I forgot to tell you. I severed
half my Achilles' heel.

746
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,992
It's healing well, I was told
it won't take a month.

747
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,967
I went...
I went to...

748
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,936
see him.

749
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,105
What, Aso-san?

750
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,374
- Stop it.
- Did Sakama send you here

751
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:24,142
to snoop on me? Huh?

752
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,411
- No, that's not it.
- Hey!

753
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:30,148
Because if that's the case,
you're too late.

754
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:31,983
Wh-what do you mean?

755
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,556
She quit.

756
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:40,659
Yutori-chan.

757
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,528
And I fired her.

758
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,766
I see.

759
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,035
I'm glad.

760
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,306
She's my woman...

761
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,009
I'd never let her work
at a place like that.

762
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:01,780
What?

763
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:09,487
We're seeing each other.

764
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,325
I know he's my son, but...

765
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,827
I'm ashamed of him.

766
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,366
- Wait just a second.
- I'm sorry.

767
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,202
Does my sister...

768
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,238
know...

769
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,107
That he has a baby?

770
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,977
Well, if you, Sakama-san...

771
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,845
He's having an illicit relationship!

772
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,981
I am truly sorry!

773
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:39,317
It's not for you to apologize,
Aso-san.

774
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,020
I want to punch him!

775
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:45,156
My leg... No, but...

776
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,726
- I want to punch him!
- Yes, yes. I understand.

777
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:50,862
You punch him for me. You're
his father, aren't you?

778
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,998
You got no business telling
me what to do.

779
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:54,599
Please let go.

780
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,602
- Please let go. Ouch. Ouch.
- I'm related to you, aren't I?

781
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,771
- Wow.
- What's up?

782
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,575
Exactly one-hundred
service tickets.

783
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:04,976
They're Maribu's.

784
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,313
He used exactly one-hundred
tickets.

785
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,582
Maybe he won't ever
come back.

786
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,785
You see...

787
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:17,555
I divorced my former wife...

788
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,359
because of my
illicit relationships.

789
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,730
It was when my son was studying
for college entrance exams.

790
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:28,266
His family had already fallen
apart on him once before.

791
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,135
My ex-wife also...

792
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,270
because he's our only son...

793
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:35,373
- put a lot of pressure on me...
- No, no, no.

794
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:38,309
No, that's irrelevant!

795
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,079
That is absolutely irrelevant
to my sister.

796
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,782
That's your problem, not mine.

797
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,785
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-I can't handle this.

798
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:50,155
- I'm sorry.
- Why did she trust a guy like that?

799
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,723
I'm sorry.

800
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,458
- Was it me?
- No, no, no.

801
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,194
- Is it my fault this happened?
- No, it wasn't.

802
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,065
How noisy. Who is it?

803
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,134
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. Sakama.

804
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:05,637
Maribu is not home yet.

805
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:06,938
I see.

806
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,741
Um, sorry to visit at such
a late hour.

807
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,676
Did that guy do something?

808
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,578
- No, well...
- Is it a woman?

809
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,847
- It's a woman, isn't it?
- No, well...

810
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,315
It's a woman, right?

811
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,052
He did it again, that idiot!

812
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,822
I have not introduced
myself, I am...

813
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:26,324
He must be just like
his father.

814
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,426
A pathetic man!

815
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:31,396
I hear his father
is a womanizer.

816
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:35,033
That is why he is also
that way.

817
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,203
But I told you, Sakama.

818
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:41,272
- To be careful.
- You told me that?

819
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,974
"He is preying on your sister."

820
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:46,144
"He is preying on your sister,
so be careful."

821
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:48,980
So that's what you were saying.
I didn't know.

822
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,348
Welcome home.

823
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:54,786
Welcome.

824
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,725
What? What do you know
about common sense?

825
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,994
I just want to protect my sister.

826
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:05,930
There are some millennials
who are like that.

827
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,766
I thought being a millennial
teacher is a fine idea.

828
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,034
- Spent the night?
- Yeah.

829
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,871
- I am Miyashita Akane's father.
- What?
