1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,870
You're dating my sister?

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,677
Are you?

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,644
Hey.

4
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:11,979
Are you?

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,649
Yikes, sorry.

6
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:16,951
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,026
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:34,068
It's messy, but come in.

9
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,937
I'll introduce you.

10
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,007
That's my wife.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,145
I can't talk with you here.
Can you go outside?

12
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,313
No, please stay here.

13
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,150
If you don't mind, that is.

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,952
Oh...

15
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,090
You want me to serve you drinks?
If so, go and buy it yourself!

16
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,363
Actually, I hadn't thought I'd
done anything wrong.

17
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,065
Besides, she was the one
who asked me out.

18
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,034
You'd go wouldn't you? If a meal
was laid before you, you eat.

19
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,839
She must've felt a little bad
for you.

20
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,574
And she did hesitate
momentarily.

21
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,811
What does your wife think?

22
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,046
I haven't given her
divorce papers yet.

23
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,148
That's where you and I differ.

24
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,117
Not filing for divorce...

25
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,152
is nothing to brag about.

26
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:28,022
You've done it so many times,
you've got no right to preach to me.

27
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,657
Hey.

28
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:33,227
Let's start from the beginning.
It was the distillery tour...

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,695
What about club activities?

30
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,698
I'm busy trying to
find employment.

31
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,935
I thought she was
aloof at first.

32
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,369
There was no vibe
between us.

33
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,139
She was dark and boring.

34
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,243
I asked her if she was millennial,
like her name implied.

35
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,213
It's like you went to college just
to look for employment.

36
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,781
- Huh?
- Because...

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:57,351
I was asking you about
college, but...

38
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,886
you just talk about finding
employment.

39
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,987
Everybody's like that.

40
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,022
And you, are a college
student on hiatus!

41
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,758
At your age, I don't care if you're
trying for Todai or Kyodai,

42
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,660
but don't act so proud when
you haven't even gotten in!

43
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,031
- She contacted me first.
- How?

44
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,434
- Remember the business card?
- Store manager?

45
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,735
Just like you.

46
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,303
It's a girls bar though...

47
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,672
- I found it in my brother's pocket.
- Seriously?

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,609
Your security is a little
too lax, isn't it?

49
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,910
Shut up!

50
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,811
Sorry.

51
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,647
Anyway...

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,781
She did the job interview.

53
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,717
- I want to change.
- At a girls bar?

54
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,052
Not worth a thing in society;
all I do is look for employment.

55
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,327
I didn't understand a word
of what she was talking about.

56
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,229
But she was totally cute.

57
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,365
She's the most popular too.

58
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,733
So...

59
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,870
- Did you lay a hand on her?
- Don't rush it, geezer.

60
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,874
There's an order to things.

61
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,042
Hey.

62
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:58,746
I laid a hand on her.

63
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,673
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

64
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,111
Sorry, I was just kidding.

65
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,315
But think about it,
Yutori-chan.

66
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,317
You just went to the university
that accepted you...

67
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,086
then just hope to get employed;
is that all you want?

68
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,591
In this world, there are people
who die unnoticed...

69
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,992
There are lots of
things you can't do,

70
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,061
places you can't go,
people you can't meet.

71
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,196
There are so lots and lots!

72
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,699
You and I are that way too.

73
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,235
Out of limitless choices, we
chose to be here, at this time.

74
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,237
That is why I want to have pride

75
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,707
and a sense of responsibility with
regard to the choice I've made.

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,811
I don't want my customers to
regret choosing to come in.

77
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,880
Out of all the pubs
they could've gone to...

78
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,149
I want customers to be glad
they chose our travel agency,

79
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:13,187
out of countless agencies; that
their trip was unforgettable.

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,788
That is the kind of service I
want to give the customers.

81
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,757
I think about it all the time.

82
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,729
Maribu-san.

83
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,031
You're an unexpectedly
serious person.

84
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,466
You are not a serious person!

85
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,670
I'm ashamed that she worked
at this guy's establishment.

87
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,862
So you apologize... you're
being strangely meek...

88
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,964
I betrayed you, Sakama.

89
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,333
Didn't you feel bad toward
your wife and child?

90
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,268
She's not my wife.

91
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,872
She expected me to cheat,
from the get go.

92
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,741
You said it's my disease, that
it was genetically passed on.

93
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,476
You do what you want.

94
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,979
Don't you think of wanting
to break up?

95
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,381
Mind your own business
you geezer!

96
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,617
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,652
Let go, ouch...

98
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,423
My visa has expired, I cannot go
to a government office anyway.

99
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,492
I came here on a tourist visa.

100
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,161
We have to keep quiet,
there's no choice.

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,735
You...

102
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,371
have you no common sense?

103
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,074
I don't. What the heck is
"common sense"?

104
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,108
Hey.

105
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,544
I'm a millennial, so I was never
taught about such things.

106
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:47,081
Is it common sense to marry
and divorce repeatedly?

107
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,816
Is it?

108
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,618
You airhead!

109
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,755
It depends on how
many times.

110
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,790
Um... four or five times.

111
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,625
Ouch...

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
You have an older half-brother?

113
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,165
He's four years older;
he's an attorney.

114
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:10,604
I followed in my older brother's
academical footsteps.

115
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,272
He was top of the class.

116
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,408
My mother was furious...

117
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,877
and she put a lot of
pressure on me.

118
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,147
She's not related to my brother,
so she got competitive;

119
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,915
she wanted me to win.

120
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,585
This guy here was also considered
a prodigy back in the day.

121
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,322
- My bro passed entrance exams.
- He had the highest scores.

122
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,524
I thought he'd been negligent.

123
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,693
Just when I thought things were
finally turning my way,

124
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,029
this guy here gets involved with
a subordinate at work...

125
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,333
She wasn't a subordinate. She
was just a part-time worker.

126
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:43,036
Shut up, who's asking you to
interrupt with your prattle?

127
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,872
I haven't talked about
your illicit affair yet.

128
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,073
Never mind.

129
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,077
- I've learned what I need to know.
- What's that?

130
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,480
At your age, you're acting like
boy who hasn't grown up.

131
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,983
- I am?
- Aren't you?

132
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,987
You blamed all of your goofups
on your parents.

133
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,858
So you got compared to your fine
brother; your mom pressured you...

134
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,627
your father had illicit affairs.

135
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,796
Those things are irrelevant.

136
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,998
There's plenty people like that.

137
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,767
Those things don't mean you
can lay a hand on my sister.

138
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,437
I'm here to talk about my sister.

139
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,741
I want to protect my sister,
that's all.

140
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,746
She doesn't know you
have wife and child.

141
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,485
- Go outside.
- Please stay.

142
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,622
What are you going to do?

143
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,872
- I'll break up.
- Darn right you will.

144
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,240
It goes without saying.

145
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,742
How will you do it?

146
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,448
- I'll say I have a wife and...
- Don't ever tell her that.

147
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:05,919
Don't tell that to my sister, my
mother, or others; it stays here.

148
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,355
It's a secret between the
four of us here.

149
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,025
Nobody else must know. Yamaji-kun,
Miyashita-san, Etsuko-sensei...

150
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,231
- I got it.
- You sure?

151
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,167
I won't do anything with
Yutori-chan anymore.

152
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,401
Sorry, I mean to say...

153
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,071
I'll never see her again.

154
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,478
However,

155
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,282
it's a very delicate time for her.

156
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,620
I don't want her to feel she's been
dumped, while she's seeking work.

157
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,993
So...

158
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,396
I want you to encourage her.

159
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,831
- I can meet her?
- Without meeting her.

160
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,466
By texting, or by phone.

161
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,068
I see.

162
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,507
- Good morning.
- Masakazu did you know?

163
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,443
Do you know about Yutori's
boyfriend?

164
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,113
Oh... you sure he's real?

165
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,882
He's real all right;
not 2-D, but 3-D!

166
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,451
You should bring him
here some time.

167
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,519
Sure...

168
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,257
It might come out later, but...

169
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,227
I want to tell you the truth...

170
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:25,499
I'm brushing my teeth now,
so wait a while.

171
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,200
Wait. Wait, wait.

172
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,208
Our oldest brother is
committing adultery.

173
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,145
What is wrong with everybody?

174
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,747
Don't worry. It looks like
it won't go any further.

175
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,983
- What's this?
- Yikes!

176
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,786
Let's have a look at the browsing
history. Look at all that!

177
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,287
The cat's out of the bag.

178
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,989
This is, um...

179
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,257
I was just browsing a little.

180
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,026
Of course. I'm working
on my fertility.

181
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,530
- Adultery is the worst.
- And today's my birthday.

182
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,065
I'm leaving now.

183
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,566
Oh boy...

184
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,368
What a terrible day!

185
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,370
"Kapibara Dumpling"

186
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,943
Uh... maybe you prefer tea?

187
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,745
"Kapibara Dumpling"
- Oh, it's okay.

188
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,246
Thank you.

189
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,987
I'll explain in detail when the
division chief arrives.

190
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,491
But Nogami-san...

191
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,127
is in somewhat of trouble.

192
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,163
- Nogami-san?
- Yes. Please have a look at this.

193
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:35,402
The inventory we've been
supplying was cancelled.

194
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,506
Maybe he'll go out of business.

195
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,508
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

196
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,243
- Is your leg okay now?
- Yes.

197
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,947
What? What happened
to your leg?

198
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:50,217
But in essence transactions
have not cancelled?

199
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,420
- Yes.
- But sales was rising till March.

200
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,923
- Yes.
- No. The meats listed here...

201
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,859
are our main products.

202
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,496
The orders have been cancelled!

203
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,798
This month, two boxes of bean
sprouts, spaghetti salad...

204
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,167
Those minor items are still
in circulation.

205
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,036
- And the payments?

206
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,606
- They've creepily, easily...
- gone to another supplier.

207
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,075
- What?
- It's obvious.

208
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,143
We've been cut off.

209
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,080
Wait a second...
give me a break.

210
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,816
You should've known better.

211
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,686
Sorry... I...

212
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,924
thought I just needed to
hold down the dam...

213
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,860
I tried to do it alone...

214
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,632
I thought too highly of myself!

215
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,402
Your crying isn't going to
help our situation.

216
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,404
That's way I say you...

217
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,041
- What?
- Nothing.

218
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,978
I don't envy you, Sakama-san.

219
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,082
You're injured and you have
to deal with that subordinate.

220
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,151
So, how is Yamagishi?

221
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,855
He's working hard, with a renewed
attitude; lovable too.

222
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,324
He helps me when I'm swamped.

223
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,861
I see. The reason I ask is...

224
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,998
You've cancelled orders past
May; were you dissatisfied...

225
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,602
The season that follows May is
better for fish, rather than meat.

226
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,772
Especially the older generation,
they don't do well with fried foods.

227
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,742
Nogami-san, today's main order
was fried chicken cutlets right?

228
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:23,977
Yeah...

229
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,915
I'm not the chairman here, so...

230
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,985
I take orders from up top
sometimes.

231
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,621
But Nogami-san, you once said...

232
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,957
that you're a person-to-person
guy, not a company guy.

233
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,726
Did I say that?

234
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,296
I talk big when I'm drunk.

235
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,267
What?

236
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,702
Are you fault finding
or something?

237
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,204
No, it's just that you've been
our client for twenty years...

238
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,007
Don't assume you're entitled.

239
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,277
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,813
We make our decisions based on
tastes and prices.

241
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,749
Those are the
deciding factors.

242
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,656
- Ours tastes better.
- Ours tastes way better.

243
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,692
- Maybe they're cheaper.
- To purchase their inventory?

244
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,229
No. The difference is
probably negligible.

245
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,665
If it's neither taste nor
price, then...

246
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,334
Maybe it's customer service.

247
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,839
I had to go all over town
with the guy.

248
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,074
On company time?

249
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:32,779
He's crude when he's drunk,
despite his looks.

250
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,148
But he does look like that.

251
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,984
Depending on point of view.

252
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:43,423
He parlays from one
pub to the next...

253
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,660
Scandinavian pubs,
South American pubs...

254
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,995
and when we finally went
where they spoke Japanese...

255
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,798
we'd be at a buckwheat noodles
shop at 5:00 in the morning.

256
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,569
He'd be so drunk he'd talk to the
cook behind the counter,

257
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,238
trying to seduce her, telling her
she looks like Angelina Jolie.

258
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,507
Augh...

259
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,976
Makes me angry
just thinking about it.

260
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,881
I'll go there and act
sarcastically lovable.

261
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,417
It's grunt work. The kind of
work you don't like.

262
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,653
It's better than the grunt
work of customer-service.

263
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:19,192
I heard Miyashita-san's
promotion has been determined.

264
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,029
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

265
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,034
If she's going to Sendai, it'll
be a long distance relationship.

266
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,603
We broke up.

267
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,505
What? Seriously?

268
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,242
You can spread the word for me.

269
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,944
Because of the shock of
breaking up...

270
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,946
I severed my Achilles' heel.

271
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,621
Mmm...

272
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,156
So this is what it tastes like.

273
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,626
Is there filling?

274
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,828
- Please take one.
- Yamaji-sensei.

275
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,229
Got a minute?

276
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,163
"Kapibara Dumpling"

277
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,199
That's a gift.

278
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,500
From who?

279
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,602
From me.

280
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,309
So this is what
Kapibara tastes like.

281
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,878
Don't say such gross things.

282
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,583
- You went to Izu?
- Yeah, to the cactus park.

283
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,286
- You spent the night?
- Yeah, one night.

284
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,921
Who did you go with?

285
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,255
A friend.

286
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,291
- Somebody I know?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,528
- I only know one person.
- Yamaji.

288
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,664
We have 3 complaints

289
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,799
on accomodating the
learning disorder student.

290
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,502
We just got a call saying...

291
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,505
their child's falling grades,
could be Daigo-kun's fault.

292
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,174
- That's not the case.
- Of course, they're just excuses.

293
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,809
They're parents afterall.

294
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,078
The kids in class are happy to
accomodate, but...

295
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,450
the parents anticipating junior-high
entrance exams are getting nervous.

296
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,119
Daigo has been concerned about
that as well.

297
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,989
He's worried he's holding his
classmates behind.

298
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,828
I've been telling him
it's not the case...

299
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,165
The class is proceeding at the
same pace as other classes.

300
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:09,736
Perhaps we should switch back
to separate tutoring.

301
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,442
I just don't know how to
explain it to Daigo.

302
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,280
May I speak to the students
about this?

303
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,382
- Don't you think that's strange?
- Please.

304
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,617
It's okay, but don't you think
it's strange?

305
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,854
A man and a woman staying in
the same room at an inn.

306
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,156
- Yamaji is my friend.
- How about the bath?

307
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,991
It was separate, right?
Not mixed bath, right?

308
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,127
The room had a shower,
so I don't know about the bath.

309
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:38,365
- You went in together...
- Be quiet.

310
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,001
I wasn't told about this
trip, Akane...

311
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,673
Area manager, neither you nor
Yamaji-kun told me.

312
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,742
Why must we tell you?

313
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,078
Because they're friends.

314
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,117
- What if I went on such a trip?
- With whom?

315
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,755
- I'm just saying, what if.
- Wait a second, with whom?

316
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,792
Okay, read out loud.
One-two...

317
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,229
"Millennium education"

318
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,831
Has anyone heard of this?

319
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,268
Nobody has?

320
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:21,975
It's not about cramming your head
with stuff to score high on a test.

321
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,712
It's about taking initiative to
learn what personally interests you.

322
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,149
It's about increasing time to
experience more things.

323
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,817
That's the concept of it.

324
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,421
I'm proud to say...

325
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,924
I was one of the 1st students who
received millennial education.

326
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,726
They call us "first generation
millennials."

327
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,695
For example...

328
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,665
All of you don't have school
on Saturday and Sunday, right?

329
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,935
However, adults older than me...

330
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,672
had to go to school...

331
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,941
even on Saturdays.

332
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,111
What!
Those poor people!

333
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,879
Okay, okay...

334
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,082
What do you think happened to the
children on millennial education?

335
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,617
They became stupid.

336
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,153
You are right.

337
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,025
Their academic abilities plummeted,
it became a societal problem.

338
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,727
After they became grownups...

339
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:18,965
they were incompetent; they were
apathetic; they were gutless...

340
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,203
they'd only do what they were told.
They had no sense of rivalry.

341
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,406
They could not sense danger, they
had no focus.

342
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,977
They were unable to respond
to unexpected things.

343
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,714
But those are all just excuses.

344
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:40,487
At their own convenience, they
made Saturday a no-school day,

345
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,991
and made textbooks thin, then
treat us like we're broken.

346
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,962
However, even the generation
of millennials...

347
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,798
has their good aspects.

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,169
They don't get in the way
of others.

349
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,240
They strive for what's best without
being influenced.

350
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,877
They revere individuality.

351
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,448
- Daigo-kun, stand up.
- Yes.

352
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,352
As you all know...

353
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,355
Daigo-kun is not good at math.

354
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,792
But he's good at everything else.
He got 100 in kanji, that's awesome.

355
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,462
However...

356
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,798
he has trouble calculating.

357
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,669
Who thinks their studies will get
negatively affected if they

358
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,905
were in the same class
as Daigo-kun?

359
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,374
Be honest and raise your hand.

360
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,314
Okay.

361
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,583
In that case...

362
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,019
What if we ignored Daigo,

363
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,123
- and proceeded without him?
- I'd feel sorry for Daigo.

364
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,493
Who agrees with him?

365
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,729
Okay, thank you.

366
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:58,998
Okay then...

367
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,601
- What should we do?
- Yes.

368
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,005
I think only Daigo should be allowed
to use an electronic calculator.

369
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,541
What? But that's not fair.

370
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,278
But kids who don't see well
wear glasses.

371
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,715
- So if a kid's not smart...
- You're wrong about that.

372
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,150
Daigo just has...

373
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,954
trouble calculating divisions,
that's all.

374
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,691
But I think yours is a good idea.

375
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,359
Glasses, calculators...

376
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,963
are tools necessary for all of us
to learn together.

377
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,199
However...

378
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,401
what if Daigo's grades go up...

379
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,404
and he surpasses all of you?

380
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,742
- That would make me mad.
- You'd be mad, then what?

381
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,978
I'll use a calculator too.

382
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,046
Okay, okay.

383
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,019
What do you say, Daigo?

384
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,121
What do you want to do?

385
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,292
I... want to learn along
with everybody.

386
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,961
Why is that?

387
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,664
Because when I get an
answer correct...

388
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,066
everybody is glad for me.

389
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,735
Which makes me even gladder.

390
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,204
I see.

391
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,909
- Do you like everybody?
- Yes.

392
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,712
Does everybody like him too?

393
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,814
Yes.

394
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,118
Thank you everybody. Thank you
Daigo. You may sit.

395
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,124
So, starting tomorrow,
Daigo-kun will

396
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,793
take only the math class
separately,

397
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,162
in the study room.

398
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,831
What? Why?

399
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,101
It's not what you think.
Listen.

400
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,770
I'm not doing this

401
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,205
so Daigo-kun will get left
behind; nor because

402
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,441
I want Daigo-kun to do
better than Mori-kun.

403
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,545
It is a necessary,
special measure...

404
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,882
so that he can learn along
with everybody...

405
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,884
so that he can become a
productive grownup,

406
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,285
together with you all.

407
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,957
A time will come when Daigo
is allowed to use a calculator.

408
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,361
That is true equality.

409
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,998
I believe that...

410
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,867
that is the true
millennial education.

411
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,939
Okay, and that...

412
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:21,941
wraps it up.

413
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,543
Get ready for class.

414
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,211
"Millennial"

415
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,827
I'm so sorry...

416
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,528
I couldn't quite reach a
good conclusion.

417
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,363
Not at all.

418
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:47,166
You spoke the words of a teacher.

419
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,670
- Even I was moved to tears.
- No, please.

420
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,004
Honestly...

421
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:54,841
when I first heard you were the
homeroom teacher,

422
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,543
I thought, "he's too young",
"he's a millennial",

423
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,146
"he's a virgin"!
Those were my thoughts.

424
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,316
- I'm sorry.
- Nah, nah... huh?

425
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,486
But after hearing you speak
today...

426
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,989
I thought, "this millennial
teacher is not bad".

427
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,993
- I appreciate all you do.
- Likewise, thank you.

428
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,633
How did she know?

429
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,502
Who told her? Akane-chan?
Sakama-kun?

430
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:25,705
I've never met that mother
in the first place.

431
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:29,175
The whole school knows about it,
no sense trying to hide it.

432
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:33,579
Oh yeah! Thank you
for the gift.

433
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,082
The one from Izu's
cactus garden.

434
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,717
You're still mad?

435
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,419
So anyway...

436
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,954
- listen, Akane-chan.
- She's working right now.

437
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,625
The supplementary study session
went on till 7:00 today.

438
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,361
His mother had to go to work
during the session.

439
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,830
So I had to take Daigo-kun
home, but...

440
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,333
the night job his mother was
talking about...

441
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,002
what do you think it was?

442
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,004
Something "adult"?

443
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,074
I'm sorry, sensei.

444
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,977
No, same here, sorry
to bother you at work.

445
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,713
What do you want to do?
Do you want to go home first?

446
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,583
I have the early night-shift so
I still have an hour more.

447
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:11,984
I'll study for tomorrow.

448
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:17,790
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

449
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,061
She was an angel in
a white robe.

450
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,330
Nobody's listening?

451
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,501
She got divorced
three years ago...

452
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,670
she's having a tough time with
alimony for education only.

453
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,040
She's an outstanding parent...
she's with her son all day.

454
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,042
Your phone's ringing.

455
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,291
- Hello.
- Like I said...

456
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,194
Don't answer this number,
virgin "Yamamichi".

457
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,831
So that you'll never answer
this call again...

458
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,667
Shall I cut off your lips and
ears and set fire to them?

459
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,603
Huh? Salt or sauce?

460
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,538
Salt...

461
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,940
Etsuko-sensei

462
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,144
It's Yamaji, what do you want?

463
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,281
- I'm sorry. I'll hang up.
- No, no, I'm sorry about that.

464
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,583
What? Where are you?

465
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,686
Oh... just a second.

466
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,756
I guess Yamaji's finally
getting popular.

467
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,994
I'm one of those prospects
too, right?

468
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,198
Welcome.

469
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,569
Here's your draft beer.

470
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,771
I don't have a service
coupon so...

471
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,774
- I'll have green tea.
- But I already poured this.

472
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,076
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,445
What's he sorry about?

474
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,748
He just said "I'm sorry."

475
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,122
I was with some friends...
I thought you might be here...

476
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,957
Oh, I see.

477
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,992
Oh yeah, Maribu-kun
just showed up.

478
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,160
I see.

479
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:02,828
Huh?

480
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,175
Is Yutori-chan's interview with
the chairperson tomorrow?

481
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,411
- You're speaking to me politely?
- Well...

482
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,446
may I reply to her text?

483
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,882
Just act naturally. People will
suspect something's off.

484
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,918
Welcome.

485
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,587
Please come on in.

486
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,258
- Big brother!
- We met coincidentally downstairs.

487
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,161
I was in the neighbourhood, so...

488
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,563
Don't lie. You're never in
this neighbourhood.

489
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,732
Thanks for caring for my little
brother all the time.

490
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,000
They look alike.

491
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,570
- Maribu-kun.
- Oh, you're right.

492
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,706
You're one of the
members from that day.

493
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,442
You haven't told them
anything, right?

494
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,310
Huh? Oh...

495
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,079
I haven't.

496
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,482
Please sit at the private booth.

497
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,119
- You can't butter me up.
- No, I mean it.

498
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,654
Thank you very much.

499
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,122
Thank you very much.

500
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,790
You're stopping right there?

501
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,026
Come on over here.

502
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,961
Thank you very much.

503
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:12,631
- They're number one and three.
- I see.

504
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:15,501
- I want to see numer two too.
- We will, next time.

505
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,169
We'll go to one more pub...

506
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,271
I want to go somewhere
more, you know...

507
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,174
- somewhere rougher.
- Rougher? What do you mean?

508
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,610
These two are this year's
new products.

509
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,279
"Demon Bride's Tears"
dry taste and

510
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,082
"Little Sister-in-Law,"
sweet taste.

511
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,519
- Please try them cold first.
- Thank you.

512
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,256
Oh. It's got a clean finish.

513
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,758
My brother.

514
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,526
May I please respond
in this manner?

515
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,232
Take out the "I love you"
at the end.

516
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,200
You're right. I'm sorry.

517
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,769
You're calling me "my brother"?

518
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,004
This sake is good hot too.

519
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,939
- It's smooth.
- Thank you very much.

520
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,875
How much is each bottle?

521
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,414
What is this?

522
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,083
What does "thanks for the meal
yesterday" mean?

523
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,518
Well...

524
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,586
I told you not to see her.

525
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,423
Never to see her again,
Michigami Maribu-san.

526
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,957
It was just for dinner,
just for dinner.

527
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,459
You sure it was just dinner?

528
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,994
Look me in the
eyes and say it.

529
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,131
- I can't say it.
- You...

530
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,367
What the heck is
wrong with you...

531
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,002
- Store manager.
- What?

532
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,438
Oh...

533
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,274
I thought we could serving
this to the customers

534
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,942
and check their response.

535
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:34,447
But we've got a fixed supplier;
and this is a franchise.

536
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,248
Of course, I understand.

537
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,418
I'll leave the bottles here.
If you're pleased with the wines...

538
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:40,920
please let me know.

539
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,289
Even if it's an order of one or
two bottles, I'd appreciate it.

540
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,624
- Please think about it.
- Understood.

541
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,960
I will take them back to the
office for an assessment.

542
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:59,572
I was told to not return till
I could get an order.

543
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,742
Mother? Sister-in-law?

544
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,713
Both of them.

545
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,884
I get rejected everywhere I go.

546
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,353
And I've never been in sales.

547
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,423
I've never even bowed
my head to anyone.

548
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,627
I was thinking of quitting outright.

549
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,629
Then I remembered you.

550
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,566
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,436
No, no.

552
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,838
I know things are
tough for you.

553
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,610
It's tough all right, like being
in a pressure cooker.

554
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:42,948
I thought it would work if
I just did it. I was too naive.

555
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,853
Are you talking about fertility?

556
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,523
I have to be grateful.

557
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,759
About the fact that you were
born into this world.

558
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,728
You're overthinking things.

559
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,665
You've heard of gifts
from heaven.

560
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,501
- They come even when you forget.
- I won't ever forget.

561
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:06,505
Always...

562
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,407
I keep thinking.

563
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,044
So what's wrong that I surfed
the net for "adult" contents?

564
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,579
Well, that's another story...

565
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:16,715
I don't know about that.

566
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:19,919
Excuse me.

567
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,458
My name is Sakama Yutori.

568
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,360
Nice to meet all of you.

569
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,834
Looking good.

570
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,603
No, no.

571
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,475
Here.

572
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,810
Well, good seeing you.

573
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,779
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

574
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,247
- You've got style.
- Nah.

575
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,782
- Let's have coffee.
- Sounds good.

576
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:50,983
It's instant coffee, but...

577
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,351
Just as I...

578
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,819
thought.

579
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,588
Nogami-san was...

580
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,823
firmly locked on to Aiai Foods.

581
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,059
Aiai? The biggest
in the business?

582
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,126
Yes.

583
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,661
He's belittling us.

584
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,464
However...
there's no way we

585
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,832
can beat the competition.

586
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:07,866
So...

587
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,002
we should bow out
with dignity...

588
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,337
No.

589
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,939
I'll call you back in 5 minutes.

590
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,275
If you don't mind,

591
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,444
I know another place that
has good wine.

592
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,645
Wine, huh?

593
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,247
I'm not in the mood for wine.

594
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,148
Care to come in?

595
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,650
If it's not wine you want...

596
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,518
maybe you want something
more exciting.

597
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,436
It's not much, but here.

598
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,581
Nakamori-kun.
Bring me a draft beer.

599
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,484
One order of draft beer!

600
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,688
From my client...

601
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,556
I got...

602
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,925
a 6 month contract extension!

603
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,061
Make an immediate
delivery, please!

604
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,635
He thinks he's a hero now.

605
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,971
I hope payments won't
be a problem.

606
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,708
Nogami-san gets carried away,
we have to be careful.

607
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,147
So anyway, here.

608
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:32,618
It's unusual for you to use a
supplier like this.

609
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,221
Because I can't let Miyashita-san
always outperform me.

610
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,725
Oh... you're talking about
the Sendai thing?

611
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,593
It's currently pending.

612
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,362
What?

613
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,698
She said she wants to
think about it.

614
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,233
Well, she's getting
to be that age...

615
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,476
I finished. May I go play now?

616
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,079
You can, but did you double
check your answers?

617
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,982
I did, but the ones I don't
know, I just don't know.

618
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,119
- Hey.
- Me too.

619
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,554
Me too.

620
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,055
Hey, hey, wait a second.

621
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,156
We're going to play.

622
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,826
Are you guys serious? Hey!

623
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,428
- Are you really serious?
- It's okay.

624
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:19,865
Daigo.

625
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,066
Do your best, Daigo.

626
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,268
Hey, he's still studying.

627
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,938
Daigo!

628
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,573
This isn't correct, Daigo.

629
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,907
This one's correct.

630
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,976
Daigo, let's play soccer.
Hurry up.

631
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,779
Sensei, play soccer with us too.

632
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,947
Let's play, let's play.

633
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,249
Be careful.

634
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,318
Don't run in the hall!

635
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,221
Watch out, slow down.

636
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,655
Don't run.

637
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:47,259
Gosh...

638
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,863
I guess there was no point
in putting him in a separate room.

639
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,598
Truly...

640
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,466
it's all thanks to you,
Yamaji-sensei.

641
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,868
No, no...

642
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,308
Huh?

643
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,243
Yeah...

644
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,616
Huh?

645
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,020
Oh...

646
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,395
Did you see that?

647
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,030
Did I stare that much?

648
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,499
You're wearing turtle neck,
you're fully covered.

649
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,668
Yama-chan, you're looking
for excitement, aren't you?

650
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,871
I think that sometimes too.

651
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:33,972
What?

652
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,741
What are you afraid of,
Yama-chan?

653
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,976
Women are not scary.

654
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,179
Maybe you need to be
a little afraid.

655
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,815
Well, you know, when you fall
in love it's like that...

656
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,751
It's just the natural
progression of things.

657
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:46,952
In my case, it so happens

658
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,188
that the one has not yet
appeared.

659
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,223
But it has not affected my life.

660
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,225
In fact, I'm not short on
female friends...

661
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,128
I have a good relationship
with all of them.

662
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,696
It sounds like a comment
made by an actor.

663
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,865
But I know they're
doing it for sure.

664
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,733
But you see...

665
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,471
I know you'll think I'm stupid
for saying this, but...

666
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,738
I already think that
so go ahead.

667
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,709
Women change after
their first time.

668
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:12,311
Yeah.

669
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,946
I'm sensitive to those things.

670
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,181
Because I've been an observer
for 29 years.

671
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,183
So I can tell who's doing it
with who.

672
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,618
I'm usually right.

673
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,819
And women's attitudes change.

674
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,221
They take advantage.
They become arrogant.

675
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,722
They become greedy.
They become moody.

676
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:24,790
They become happy.

677
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,893
I don't want the person
I really like...

678
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,229
to change right in front
of everyone.

679
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,164
On top of that, I'll change too,

680
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,198
just after doing it once.

681
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,867
There's no way to go back
after that.

682
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,070
You don't change.

683
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,105
I dunno...

684
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,607
You won't change that much.

685
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,742
If you do it once,
you'd want to do it again.

686
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:46,411
You do it again, you want
to do it with others. That's all.

687
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,247
You guys are on
different levels.

688
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:49,648
- Right?
- Yeah.

689
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,617
- You understand?
- Right?

690
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,286
-Right?
-That's right.

691
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,523
I feel like I want to try
all kinds of things...

692
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,393
but it's impossible to go out with
every woman in the world.

693
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,829
To choose one...

694
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,564
implies you reject all others.

695
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,099
If that's the case...

696
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,101
if I don't choose a single one...

697
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,336
I reject no one. No one's
feelings are hurt.

698
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,871
I won't get hurt either.

699
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:14,907
Am I wrong?

700
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,208
I...

701
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,544
want to go out...

702
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,946
with every woman in the world.

703
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,316
- Did you talk like that with Akane?
- We did.

704
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,690
What did she say?

705
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,359
- Bring it on!
- Huh?

706
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,064
I'll show you how we change.

707
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,499
- So come here!
- No, no.

708
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,934
You got me all wrong.

709
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,936
About what?

710
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,804
You want to change too,
don't you?

711
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:47,439
No, you're drunk.

712
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,907
And I don't want to hurt
Masakazu-kun.

713
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,376
He won't know if we
keep quiet about it.

714
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:52,878
Besides, we separated.

715
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,781
That's why I took this trip,
to allay my broken heart.

716
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,116
I understand, but...

717
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:00,852
But you see...

718
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:02,821
that's got nothing to do with...

719
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,441
- You're pathetic.
- Huh?

720
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,577
I thought you had more guts
than that.

721
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,613
No, no, don't get me wrong.

722
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:28,914
Well you see...

723
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,016
No, huh? Huh?

724
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:32,651
Huh?

725
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,894
You'll never become happy if
you're scared

726
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,730
to get your heart broken.

727
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,369
Guys who can never break

728
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,603
your heart...

729
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,974
can never make anybody happy.

730
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,015
You're talking about
Masakazu-kun.

731
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,891
Oh boy...

732
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,909
No...

733
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,310
No, that's not it.

734
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,012
This. You see.

735
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,248
Y-your foot was bare...

736
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,350
sticking outside
your gown...

737
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,318
You see...

738
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,021
Um, seriously...

739
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:54,700
Are you asleep?

740
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,805
Are you crying?

741
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:08,113
I didn't want to break up!

742
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,086
I realised it only after
breaking up.

743
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:16,621
That...

744
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,325
there were several
precarious times...

745
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,729
because...

746
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,430
he never made an effort.

747
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:27,899
He was awkward.

748
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,501
He's a millennial.

749
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,169
So...

750
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,806
I thought I'd ruin him if
we kept going out.

751
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,446
But...

752
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,284
I've never been asked by a man

753
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,420
to go separate ways.

754
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:50,956
Is that so?

755
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,125
That is so.

756
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:54,893
I dunno...

757
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,597
I panicked hearing about her
promotion and stuff...

758
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,100
I thought I better change,
or else I'm no good.

759
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:05,937
I didn't care...

760
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,141
if Masakazu was no good.

761
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,979
It's not like he'd ever become
the company chairman,

762
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,480
no matter how hard he works.

763
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,084
He's not the type to climb the
corporate ladder

764
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,418
by changing jobs.

765
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,790
So I didn't care if he
didn't change.

766
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,727
He didn't have to aim for the top.

767
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,731
That's what I wanted
to tell him, but...

768
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,401
I was his superior, so I
couldn't say that to him.

769
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,436
I guess not.

770
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,572
He's obnoxious...

771
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,277
he's a blockhead...

772
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,581
He's wishy-washy...

773
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,686
He has no self-confidence...

774
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,722
But that's who Masakazu is.

775
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,792
It'd be no fun if he changed.

776
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,364
If I wanted him to change, it
could've been anybody else.

777
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,266
It can be Yamaji.

778
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,001
Yeah... huh?

779
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,109
I'm quitting my job.

780
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,948
I'm not going to Sendai.

781
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:29,221
I want to be with the
no-good Masakazu.

782
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:37,329
But I can't tell him that.

783
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:47,072
I'm a boring woman.

784
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:51,209
That's not true.

785
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,448
You're a fine woman,
Akane-chan.

786
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,750
You'd be wasted on me.

787
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,752
Hand me the towel.

788
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,158
So...

789
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:08,159
Are you doing it?

790
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,429
Or not?

791
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:14,199
Stop kidding around.
We're having a serious talk.

792
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,202
Gosh...

793
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,938
I told Masakazu-kun...

794
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,875
that although I can be your
conversational companion...

795
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,313
I'm incapable of making
you happy.

796
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,685
The only person who
can make you happy...

797
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,523
And that was all.

798
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,325
I dunno...

799
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,060
maybe it's because
Yamaji told the story...

800
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,995
I felt like crying and yet
I couldn't.

801
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,196
What's that supposed to mean?

802
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,733
He's crying.

803
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,669
You see...

804
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,203
I should've gone...

805
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:54,272
on that trip with her.

806
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,974
I thought that too.

807
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,443
But if you guys went, you'd
sleep together and it'd be all over.

808
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,378
I'll zip it.

809
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:04,950
So...

810
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:06,851
are you going to ask her back?

811
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:09,621
No...

812
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,124
after hearing what you'd said...

813
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,493
I definitely can't ask her.

814
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,862
- Why?
- Because I want to change.

815
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:19,564
If...

816
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:23,335
I can't change...

817
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:27,138
it'd be unbearable.

818
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:33,211
I'm so glad, Yutori
got hired.

819
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,813
Ta-da.

820
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,816
Oh.

821
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,250
"Oh"? Is that all?

822
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:41,586
That's right, we must celebrate.

823
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,322
Your boyfriend will celebrate it
for you, won't he?

824
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,693
I got an order from
Masakazu's shop...

825
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,429
for "Demon Bride's
Tears" and

826
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:55,233
"Little Sister-in-Law", officially.

827
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,535
Oh. I see.

828
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,237
Sorry about the terrible names.

829
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:01,539
Here's the extra order of
"Little Sister-in-Law".

830
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,974
Thank you very much.

831
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,076
I think he's finally
getting serious.

832
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,911
I'll go lend a hand.

833
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,280
Come on, let's go eat.

834
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:14,953
You got hired?

835
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,154
Congratulations.

836
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,156
We should celebrate.

837
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,725
Yeah... that's true.

838
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:21,993
Yeah.

839
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:23,995
I'll fade out slowly.

840
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,197
Huh? Yeah.

841
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,500
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,901
Right away, yes.

843
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,036
We'll break up right away.

844
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,038
Sorry, I'm at work now.
Let's talk later.

845
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,209
- Was it crowded?
- Not at all.

846
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,578
- It's a weekday.
- True.

847
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,580
It's kind of noisy here.

848
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,783
There's been a little problem.

849
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,620
- Sorry to interrupt...
- What?

850
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,990
Miyashita-san. Thank you,
regarding the rice wine.

851
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:55,493
Oh, sure. They decided the wines
give personality to the shops.

852
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,829
Where are you crutches?

853
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,764
Oh no. I forgot them.

854
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,332
Anyway...

855
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,701
go to Nogami-san's,
right away.

856
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:05,437
- Huh?
- He has food poisoning.

857
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,371
Huh?

858
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:10,942
Out of all the customers who
ate the shipped bento...

859
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,311
30 people were taken sick
to a nearby hospital.

860
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:15,980
According to investigation...

861
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,649
Isn't that Masakazu's...

862
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,017
client?

863
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,251
What?

864
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,054
They were expired?

865
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:25,690
They repackaged expired
bentos and sold them.

866
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:27,725
Sounds like something
Nogami-san would do.

867
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:28,993
Where's Yamagishi?

868
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,395
I cannot reach him.

869
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,930
That guy again...

870
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,832
Division chief Hayakawa is
there already.

871
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:34,933
You go there now too.

872
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,769
- Yes.
- But before you go...

873
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,170
I know the timing is odd, but...

874
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:41,406
This man here...

875
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:45,477
Yes.

876
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,812
- He's my father.
- What?

877
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,247
That's him?

878
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,783
Well now...

879
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:53,918
I am Miyashita Akane's father.

880
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:56,020
I have arrived from Saga,
just today.

881
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:01,059
- We are sorry.
- This is food poisoning.

882
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,861
Office workers are in a battle.

883
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,929
You have to be more ashamed.

884
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:05,897
You and me both.

885
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,932
Yamaji's here.

886
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,000
A gardener?

887
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,935
I do love Akane-san.

888
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,837
But I do not like her father.
