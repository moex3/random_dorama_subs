1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,471
Yesterday at the opening of an
event in the city,

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:08,275
30 visitors reported nausea after
eating catered bento.

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,811
They were taken to a nearby
hospital.

4
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:14,482
The salmonella bacteria was
detected in the patients.

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:19,854
The cause was expired frozen meat
used by the bento packager...

6
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,222
Hayakawa-san.

7
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,091
You're alone? Where's Yamagishi?

8
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,060
I haven't been able to reach him.

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,631
Figures; millennials
just don't grow up.

10
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,636
Take the badge off.

11
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,006
- Is Nogami-san at his office?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,577
Oh! Hey!

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,922
If somebody dies we're both
done for; do you realize that?

14
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:56,757
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,194
We couldn't find the person
in charge, so the former...

16
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:04,632
Did Min Min market frozen meat
and side dishes only this month?

17
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,203
There's also flavor-flakes...

18
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,638
We're talking about the
food poisoning case;

19
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,072
so flavor-flakes don't count.

20
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,507
The issue here is, was the cause...

21
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,278
your company's shumai
or Min Min's chicken wings?

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,448
Both were supposedly included
in the bento yesterday.

23
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,349
Chicken wings?

24
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,786
If so, those were used before
the expiration date.

25
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,222
Huh? What are you saying, then?

26
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,859
You're saying it was our shumai?

27
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,928
This is what happened,
Sakama-san...

28
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:38,966
they didn't all fit in the freezer,
so they naturally thawed out.

29
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,035
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

30
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,271
We ordered too much, double
the amount of food.

31
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,739
How long's this been going on?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,275
I don't know, let's see...

33
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,610
Hey!
Get your act together old man!

34
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,013
Why did you sell food that didn't
fit in the freezer?

35
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:57,651
Because I couldn't sever ties
with either company.

36
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,854
Ai Ai and Min Min are both
faithful companies...

37
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,388
You were getting
buttered up.

38
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:06,093
I heard Min Min would take you to
"naughty" places.

39
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,533
Well, there's no point in raising a
fuss. What's done is done.

40
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,768
Let's talk about the future instead.

41
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,406
First we must make public apology,
explain how it happened,

42
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,475
and respond to the media.

43
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:26,814
So far it's clear that the cause was
careless food maintenance.

44
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,283
The media will be all over that.

45
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:33,254
Your relationship to Min Min
goes back quite a long way.

46
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,223
Yes. It goes back to the
inception of the business, so...

47
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,325
it's been 23 years.

48
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,729
Our company's relationship to
you is short in comparison.

49
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,431
My relationship with you
started just this year;

50
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,569
I heard you forced
a contract on us.

51
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,906
We are merely newcomers.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,442
What is it you're trying to say?

53
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,712
To be clear...

54
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:05,119
our request to you is to not
mention the name of our company.

55
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,520
He's direct.

56
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:10,057
Excuse me, but we're a
major business.

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,325
We have an image to protect.

58
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,662
Of course, I'm not asking you
to do us this favor for free.

59
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,630
Nogami-san.

60
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,300
How much do you currently
owe us?

61
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:23,671
How much? Well... I haven't
even made a single payment yet.

62
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,339
Approximately 3 million yen.

63
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:31,011
Our company will not bill you
a penny of it.

64
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:39,053
Your lawsuit and compensations
to victims will be quite heavy.

65
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:43,657
It's best if you cut as many
corners as you can.

66
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,061
Shouldn't we find out first if the
culprit was the wing or shumai?

67
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,662
It wasn't us!

68
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,431
We didn't deliver a supply.

69
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,004
Oh man...

70
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,908
this is so soothing...

71
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:27,034
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

72
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,338
"What are you going to do?"
he asked. That young punk!

73
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,008
He jumped ship real fast.

74
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,112
3 million must be a drop in the
bucket for a major corporation.

75
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,947
How much were <i>we</i> owed?

76
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,282
-Let's see...
- It doesn't matter!

77
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,018
We can't afford to
waive debts owed to us.

78
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,452
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,824
Come with me.

80
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,326
Yes.

81
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,568
All right, all right.

82
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,971
Come and get it.

83
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,173
Okay.

84
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,176
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

85
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,812
Oh. I'm sorry.

86
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,785
Hey! There!

88
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,222
Argh!

89
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,392
Don't mess with me!

90
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,527
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,662
- Don't mess with me!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

92
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,431
Okay.

93
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,433
Don't mess with me.

94
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,370
Damn it!

95
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,557
I feel better now.

96
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,558
Really?

97
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,026
Of course not!

98
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,260
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,399
That Nogami-san...

100
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,235
what'll he do after
losing his connections?

101
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,438
Under normal circumstances he'd
take the blame and get fired.

102
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,339
Huh?

103
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:17,010
The penalty is severe on
the mishandling of food.

104
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,115
His excuse was the supply thawed
because it didn't fit the freezer.

105
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,516
Sounds like my wife.

106
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,452
I sort of...

107
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,856
feel responsible.

108
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,025
That time...

109
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,895
had I listened to Yamagishi
and pulled us out...

110
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,631
"...this wouldn't have happened";
is that what you're saying?

111
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,634
I didn't want to let them
usurp our business...

112
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,970
and I, personally...

113
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,006
wanted a feather in my cap before
returning to business management.

114
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,741
Then my girlfriend got transferred,

115
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,843
There were so many things
happening...

116
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,646
I panicked and did things
I'd usually never do.

117
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,849
As a result I've hurt not only

118
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,218
Nogami-san, but also our
company's name.

119
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,325
Let's go the opposite direction.

120
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,393
Opposite direction?

121
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,430
You have trusted us...

122
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,599
no, no, no...

123
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,035
at this time...

124
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:19,773
although you had entrusted
in our company...

125
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:24,578
no, no... we were the grateful
recipients of your trust...

126
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,881
trust... uh... trust...

127
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,449
Our trusting customers...

128
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,653
we have betrayed them.

129
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,022
And of that we deeply express
our apology.

130
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,224
We are very...

131
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,595
very sorry.

132
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,930
Very...

133
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,077
We are paying a portion of the
lawsuit and compensation fees.

134
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,146
But we needn't.
We weren't in the wrong.

135
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,149
Paying though we weren't in the
wrong will improve our image.

136
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:06,220
Truly. This will guarantee an
exclusive contract with us alone.

137
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,655
Because Ai Ai Foods is
out the picture now.

138
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,090
But still ...

139
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,491
it's a sinking ship.

140
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,193
Nogami is in a desperate situation.

141
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,395
That's why we rescue him, and he
becomes indebted to us.

142
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,430
This isn't goodwill.

143
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,433
It's business. We need him
to recover or it's a bust.

144
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,035
Sakama! Keep a close
watch on Nogami.

145
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,004
His back's against the wall...

146
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,639
There's no telling what he'll do.

147
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,575
And about Yamagishi...

148
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,844
when you reach him, tell him
to write a letter of apology.

149
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,448
Awesome.

150
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,117
I've never seen Hayakawa-san
in-action before.

151
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,020
He's a legendary businessman
in spite of how he looks.

152
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,857
Compared to him I'm just...

153
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,226
slow witted...

154
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,161
all I ever do is
exercise hindsight...

155
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,231
At least you self-reflect, which
can't be said of Yamagishi.

156
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:58,238
Why is this the only
way I can talk?

157
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,406
What?

158
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,408
Oh, nothing.

159
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,014
What shall we do about my dad?

160
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,815
I am Miyashita Akane's father.

161
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,817
You haven't told him
we've broken up?

162
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,653
He wouldn't have come
if I had told him.

163
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,222
Can I bring him to the
restaurant at 7:00?

164
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,025
Yes.

165
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,226
Ouch!

166
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,028
Don't sigh!

167
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,934
Here's the special skewered
assortment of poultry.

168
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,903
- This is quite a good restaurant.
- Thank you very much.

169
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,906
Maybe they're still going out.

170
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,310
Who's the superior, the area
manager or the store manager?

171
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,278
Of course that would be
Miyashita-san.

172
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,013
In that case, area manager...

173
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,949
may I buy the store manager
another drink?

174
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,384
You don't have to ask my
permission.

175
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,019
Ah yes.

176
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,655
Go on, have a seat.

177
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,923
We don't have a glass. Hey...

178
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,091
He sat down.

179
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,193
He can't escape now.

180
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,029
Why does he speak to you
using polite ceremony?

181
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,433
Why does he call you
"Miyashita-san"?

182
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,237
I'm his superior. He can't call
me "Akane-chan", can he?

183
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,174
He has to use the honorific
"-san" even after marriage?

184
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,142
That's pathetic.

185
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,944
He kept grinning like a fool.

186
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,846
I have no idea what he's thinking.

187
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,549
You want to put on sweats?

188
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,017
It's Masakazu's but...

189
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,320
You lived together?

190
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,223
No. He lives far away, he stayed
when he missed the last train.

191
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,726
What the heck is that?

192
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,929
I don't like the way he
responds to my questions.

193
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,964
Are you the second son,
Masakazu-kun?

194
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,433
That is so. So, so, so.

195
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,736
"So, so, so, so."

196
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:36,636
Was he telling me to die?

197
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,339
He wasn't making a
pun about death.

198
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,307
He was nervous.

199
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,242
And then...

200
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,644
he fiddled with his cell phone
during our conversation.

201
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:49,483
If I have to be in Yurakucho at 10,
I should leave the apartment at 9.

202
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,819
A friend from my townhall days will
be at the local-products exhibit...

203
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,655
Get on the train to Ikebukuro
at 9:28,

204
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,424
then change to the JR at
Tokyo Station.

205
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,525
Oh, sure.

206
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,296
Wait, the Yurakucho Line from
Akasaka-mitsuke is 2 minutes faster.

207
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,931
Please board the rearmost car.

208
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,435
Wait, the Ginza Line comes
a minute later...

209
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:12,172
Wait, if you got off at Hibiya and
walked at 15km per hour...

210
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,742
I can't walk at 15km per hour.

211
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,245
Dad, are you lonesome,
on your own?

212
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,013
Me?

213
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,848
You talk a lot.

214
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,451
Don't you have friends to talk
to in Saga?

215
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,019
Of course I do.

216
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,856
Kazushi comes home
on weekends too.

217
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,427
Anyway...

218
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,896
no matter what you do...

219
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,865
it won't last long.

220
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,303
Sleep on the futon.

221
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,306
I have to drive the school
bus in the morning.

222
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,675
What? You're still
doing that?

223
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,077
You better quit.
It's dangerous.

224
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,945
Voicing your concern?

225
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,481
The elderly are sensitively aware of
when they're being treated as old.

226
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,950
Young people wouldn't understand.

227
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,052
We elderly get treated like so.

228
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,988
So all we ever say are
elderly stuff.

229
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,795
What are you doing there?

230
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,030
Oh...

231
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,032
"Grave of Tanoguchi household"

232
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,267
I called Tanoguchi-san.

233
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,236
I told her you might be going
there, so I asked her to call me.

234
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,840
She said she's thinking of
moving soon...

235
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,309
since the forty-nine days of
mourning have passed.

236
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,645
I see.

237
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,049
Time passed so fast.

238
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,025
I watched the press
conference on TV.

239
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,027
You should've been there
in person.

240
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,465
She scolded me.

241
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,702
I don't want you coming
here all the time.

242
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,906
Sure, I think of you like
a son, but...

243
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,643
you're not my son.

244
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,214
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,852
The way you habitually pout like
that, you're just like Hiroyuki.

246
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,588
You really should...

247
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,825
openly display your
shortcomings...

248
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,327
entrust yourself to the
people at the office.

249
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,732
The fish!

250
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,235
Well...

251
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,440
I really can't do that. I've already
given them an initial impression.

252
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,477
You disappeared twice on them,
think about it.

253
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,715
For you kids, "you can do it
if you try" is a myth.

254
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,018
You kids "can't do it
if you don't try."

255
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,590
So...

256
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,660
why didn't I say that...

257
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,662
to my son?

258
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,263
Um...

259
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:55,535
Can I have grated daikon
radish with this?

260
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,237
Thick-skinned.

261
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,473
Here.

262
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,008
Thank you.

263
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,213
I don't know why I can't
be normal.

264
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm either up or I'm down.

265
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,220
It's one or the other.

266
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,224
You just need more
humbling experiences.

267
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,226
You and me, both.

268
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,698
The logogram of 'shame' is comp-
osed of 'ear' and 'heart'...

269
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,799
Yes?

270
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,136
'Ear' and...

271
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,005
'heart.'

272
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,007
So?

273
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,476
Well...

274
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,778
I thought I'd think
of something, but...

275
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,947
nothing at all came to mind.

276
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,850
Very!

277
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:48,188
Very sorry!

278
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,422
I'm sorry!

279
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,691
Oh no... Masa-kun
hasn't done anything wrong,

280
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,327
yet he's bowing in apology.

281
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,229
<i>The number one cause is</i>

282
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,965
- <i>said to be the ingredients of...</i>
- Is that okay?

283
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,900
That necktie...

284
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,036
Look.

285
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,106
<i>The number of victims has
risen to 41...</i>

286
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,574
Oh my.

287
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,010
What...

288
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,284
This is where you start,
Nogami-san.

289
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,886
You have no choice but to
claw your way up.

290
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,688
Yes.

291
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:26,092
First, daycare facilities and pre-
schools on the client list...

292
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,528
you must go to schools and bus-
inesses, and endure the clamor.

293
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,063
Yamagishi will go with you.

294
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:35,902
We'll estimate the renumerations
to victim households...

295
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,774
fortunately there were no critically
cases; we must act swiftly.

296
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,009
Yes.

297
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,312
Don't get gloomy on me...

298
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,946
old man.

299
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,848
Show some excitement!

300
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:52,018
Like when you sang the Matsuyama
Chiaki song at karaoke.

301
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,987
- Yamagishi.
- It's all right.

302
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,023
I'm actually grateful.

303
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,893
But...

304
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,096
why are you so caring to me?

305
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,900
A guy like me. Just a...

306
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,035
bento caterering company's...

307
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,639
soon-to-retire site manager.

308
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,007
Because we accept you

309
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,643
for the man that you are.

310
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,146
That's why...

311
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,449
we're going to give
you the loan.

312
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,025
Thank you.

313
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm grateful!

314
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,702
Damn it!

315
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,216
Would you have preferred
a better hotel?

316
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,238
Or would you have preferred that
it wasn't a hotel at all?

317
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,441
Why do you ask?

318
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,243
Because you're so quiet.

319
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:28,314
My brother doesn't know
a thing about this.

320
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,488
But now that I've gotten hired...

321
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,426
I've been thinking of telling
him about us.

322
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,465
Now you're quiet.

323
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,267
No...

324
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,903
I've been thinking the same.

325
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,138
It's only right.

326
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,309
Next year about now, we'll be
worker and college student.

327
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,481
I've finally landed a job at an
office that would hire me.

328
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,017
I can't ask for more.

329
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,420
Bathroom.

330
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:30,143
"Rental Man: 1,000 yen per hour"

331
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,013
"Which rental man will
you play with?"

332
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,516
What?

333
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,486
I never thought I'd see you again.

334
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,154
Neither did I.

335
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,323
It's been a month since
I've been going out with him.

336
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,760
I thought things would be more
exciting after I got hired.

337
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,095
But they haven't been?

338
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:54,467
The proprietor's ideas are novel;
they're beyond dispute, but...

339
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:58,137
when I think about him, I see he's
just a college student on hiatus.

340
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:02,342
So we're just a college student and
hiatus-student couple.

341
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,812
Your older brother though,
he's stable.

342
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,680
Yes... huh?

343
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,651
Did I ever tell you I had
an older brother?

344
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,756
No... no, you see. Because
you're like a cute little sister.

345
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,826
So I thought you probably had
an older brother...

346
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,561
Amazing.

347
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,730
Because you see, Aso-san...

348
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:30,136
- My brother and Maribu are friends.
- What?

349
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,240
There's something thrilling
about that.

350
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,144
And if there was adultery involved,
it'd really get exciting.

351
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,616
Adultery?

352
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,719
Are you okay?

353
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,556
The meeting day...

354
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,723
Huh?

355
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,727
The meeting day. The second
Saturday of every month.

356
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,397
I don't think he'll come, but...

357
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,799
it's meeting day. What am
I going to do?

358
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,269
Meeting day... oh boy.

359
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,638
The father of the boy with
learning disability...

360
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,274
is in denial about the facts.

361
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,109
"It's impossible to be
born with it."

362
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,912
And that's why he's divorcing?

363
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,314
- No, it was because of adultery.
- I see.

364
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:19,552
Anyway, his coming is going to
test my mettle as a teacher.

365
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,487
He's not interested in
contrary opinions.

366
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,856
Does he even have the right?

367
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,093
He's an adulterer who
abandoned his wife and child.

368
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,829
I knew you'd get it wrong.

369
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,432
What? What's so funny?

370
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,367
The adulterer...

371
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,035
Huh?

372
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,537
...was the wife.

373
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,571
Oh, I see.

374
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,406
Not to mention,
her illicit partner was...

375
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,509
What? What?
What's so funny?

376
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,480
...was the previous school's
homeroom teacher.

377
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,449
I see.

378
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,818
I was serious.

379
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,755
You might think of me
as unfaithful, but...

380
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,058
he became a father-figure
to my son.

381
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,229
My husband and I were
already on the outs, so...

382
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:07,700
But he was young,
he was passionate...

383
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,602
I gave him my all.

384
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:13,339
In other words, Nanae
has a track record.

385
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:17,176
She doesn't regret having been in an
illicit relationship with a teacher.

386
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,115
She's outrageously naughty.
Naughtiness personified.

387
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,050
Yamaji-san, everyone
can hear you.

388
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,486
Anyway, what's it all about?

389
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,088
I've scored zero this
past 29 years.

390
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,157
So why does it suddenly go from
number 1 to number 2?

391
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,992
What do you mean by
"number 2"?

392
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,028
Yamaji-sensei.

393
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,801
It's too fast.

394
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,605
I am Harashima Daigo's father.

395
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,006
That was my old name.

396
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,176
This is Yamaji-sensei,
the homeroom teacher.

397
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,313
You're young.
Twenties?

398
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,981
Yes. I'm 29.

399
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,450
The homeroom teacher at the
former school was no good.

400
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,620
Because my son is fully capable
when he tries.

401
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,691
I'm counting on you, sensei.
Right?

402
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,693
Yes.

403
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,362
I will see you in class.

404
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,105
Do your best.

405
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,012
Are you going to be okay?

406
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,181
Maybe you should change the
study topic.

407
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,182
Good grief...

408
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,617
It's father's observation day. We
couldn't have told him not to come.

409
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,853
He's going to sit in on the
math class, of all things.

410
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,188
Actually, it was Daigo-kun

411
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,556
himself who told him to
come during math.

412
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,091
Isn't that so, Yamaji-sensei?

413
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,426
S-sorry...

414
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,895
my ears are ringing...

415
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,399
Yes. Yes. Yes.

416
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,601
Okay then, Mori-kun.

417
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,769
Yay. Yes.

418
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,572
Me! Me! Me!

419
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,240
All right, Tadokoro-kun.

420
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,775
All right.

421
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,745
Next, Tsutsui-san.

422
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,714
And Nozawa-san.

423
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,317
One more to go.

424
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,254
Me! Me! Me!

425
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,591
Okay then. Daigo-kun.

426
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,892
Yes.

427
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,176
Okay.

428
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:36,115
Don't sweat it, Daigo. What do you
do when you don't know the step?

429
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,785
You go in order, from 1.

430
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,219
And go on dividing like that.
Right?

431
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,100
And then? Subtraction.

432
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:03,943
You can do it.

433
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,278
You can do it, Daigo!

434
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,647
Daigo, you can do it!

435
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,348
D-a-i-go.

436
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:10,983
D-a-i-go.

437
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,652
D-a-i-go.

438
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,187
D-a-i-go.

439
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,822
D-a-i-go.

440
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,423
D-a-i-go.

441
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,025
D-a-i-go.

442
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,660
D-a-i-go.

443
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,261
D-a-i-go.

444
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:24,197
D-a-i-go.

445
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,232
Wrong!

446
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,634
It's "6".

447
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,436
Dad...

448
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,107
Don't go easy on him.

449
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,776
This is a waste of time.

450
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,979
Please stop.

451
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,284
Look Daigo, watch carefully.

452
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,452
You can't.

453
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,189
But the chime will go off.

454
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,691
And if it does, fine.

455
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:56,929
Okay, Daigo.

456
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,799
Let's multiply one more time.

457
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,238
D-a-i-go.

458
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,939
D-a-i-go.

459
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,641
D-a-i-go.

460
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,276
D-a-i-go.

461
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,011
D-a-i-go.

462
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,646
D-a-i-go.

463
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,381
D-a-i-go.

464
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,016
D-a-i-go.

465
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,184
D-a-i-go.

466
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,021
He was a locally prominent

467
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,756
government employee.

468
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,693
He totally aged after
my mother died.

469
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,296
The problem is...

470
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,266
he can't come to terms with it.

471
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,772
The light's turning, let's go back.

472
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:43,142
He was hired as a school-bus driver
after retirement.

473
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,012
But he got in an accident
last year.

474
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,514
It happened after dropping
off the kids.

475
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,850
It wasn't a serious accident but...

476
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,319
Ever since then...

477
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,354
he's been down in the dumps,

478
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,924
reflecting on the chasm between
how he views himself...

479
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,059
and his actual decrepitude.

480
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,428
That's worrisome.

481
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,631
He needs to openly embrace
his faults.

482
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,533
Like that, you know...

483
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,101
the learning disability boy.

484
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,536
You mean Daigo?

485
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,238
Like Daigo-kun.

486
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,240
Because after all...

487
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,444
he got everyone to accept him
even with his inabilities.

488
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,382
I think he has
tremendous courage.

489
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,552
That's true.

490
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,555
Huh?

491
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,259
Your thinking you can get popular
with ladies using kickbacks...

492
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,995
that's what makes me think
you're just an insignificant man.

493
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,931
- I'm sorry.
- When are you guys breaking up?

494
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,033
- Store manager?
- What can I cook for you?

495
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,601
My daughter...

496
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,303
has a boyfriend...

497
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:46,739
you know, that Insta...

498
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,308
- Instant... Instantmental...
- Instagram, you mean?

499
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,609
Turnips and...

500
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,812
Turnips and
when are you breaking up?

501
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,447
And also... cartilage.

502
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,849
With salt or with sauce?

503
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,451
She's not a foreigner, you know.

504
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,253
There were pics of her
hugging a man.

505
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,022
She posts them one
after another.

506
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,690
When are you guys breaking up?

507
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:07,226
- With salt.
- Oh, salt. Sometime this week?

508
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,729
- With salt, sometime this week.
- Huh?

509
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,431
And if that's the fruit of my
40 years of labor...

510
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:13,866
with the sweat of my brow...

511
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,268
it made me feel pathetic.

512
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,504
So I...

513
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,606
just wanted to cut loose.

514
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,341
- Understand?
- I don't understand.

515
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,977
My daughter too...

516
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,079
has fallen for a man.

517
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,014
Hey. Who are you?

518
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,482
Don't butt in.

519
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,350
Father, here is your shochu
with hot water.

520
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,618
"Father"?

521
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,188
- I am Miyashita Akane's father.
- What?

522
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,991
You are?

523
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,862
I better keep my trap shut.

524
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,263
Hey.

525
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:45,197
But Miyashita-san...

526
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,366
- Hasn't broken up!
- Welcome.

527
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,602
Let me ask you something...

528
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,270
to you guys...

529
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,906
the millennials generation,
our hard-nosed generation is...

530
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,007
repellent?

531
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,343
Excuse me, but I didn't
understand that last part.

532
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,146
Geezers like us that don't know

533
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,049
Wikipedia and gigabytes...
are we repellent?

534
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,452
All I know is "Wikipedia"
and "gigabytes".

535
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:07,553
We're repellent.

536
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,388
In other words, we're repulsive.

537
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,990
Hey.

538
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,158
You from Kyushu?

539
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,426
Yeah, from Kurume.

540
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,994
Wow.

541
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,662
I'm from Tosu of Saga.
We're neighbors.

542
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,730
Really?

543
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,298
Saga, huh?

544
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,800
What do you want to drink?

545
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,202
I'll get you shochu.
Potato liquor.

546
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,770
Delicious potato.

547
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,859
- Chest...
- That's enough.

548
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,027
Hey.

549
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,362
What's the idea?

550
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,665
This is a public place.

551
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,533
Yelling out loud...

552
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,002
"chest, chest"...

553
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,440
There are those who have
issues with that.

554
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:05,377
There are those who
are bothered by that.

555
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:06,579
Sorry.

556
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,847
Sorry.

557
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,348
Sorry.

558
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:18,324
I'm losing it...

559
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,008
I'm done for today.

560
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,443
Huh?

561
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,112
Okay.

562
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,251
Good job today.

563
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,689
They're here.

564
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,458
Mother.

565
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,692
Mother.

566
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,295
Hurry, hurry.

567
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,465
Well, well.

568
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,801
Thank you for coming
such long distance.

569
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,504
I am the father of
Miyashita Akane.

570
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,540
I am Sakama Masakazu's
mother.

571
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,641
I am Sakama...

572
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,376
- Masakazu's older brother.
- Please come in.

573
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,944
- Thank you.
- This way please.

574
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,480
This way.

575
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,187
Man, I overslept.

576
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,721
When were they coming?

577
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:23,756
Idiot.

578
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,058
That's my younger sister,
Yutori.

579
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,429
I didn't put on makeup yet,
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,832
"Condolences: Miyashita"

581
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,675
Oh my. I was holding my breath.

582
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,611
I know I shouldn't
be so tense.

583
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,646
How silly of me.

584
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,918
Are the older brother and wife

585
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,486
- in charge of the distillery now?
- Yes.

586
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,754
Not even half a year has
gone by since we took charge.

587
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:56,822
We're very busy.

588
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,524
The distillery...

589
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,228
is always the busiest
from October to March.

590
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,530
My husband was meticulous.

591
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,232
He thoroughly trained the
workers

592
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,500
to distill new wine.

593
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,170
And after that was done...

594
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,406
he passed away in March.

595
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,809
I see.

596
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:18,777
Yes.

597
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,518
Oh no. Silence again.

598
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,487
We should talk about
cheerful things.

599
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,723
I know. Why don't you
show him the storage room?

600
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:31,624
Oh yes.

601
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,192
A social science class is coming
at noon for a tour...

602
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,294
I didn't come here on a social-
science tour.

603
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,196
Dad. You're being rude.

604
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,499
My youngest daughter Yutori
from next year is...

605
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:43,602
I didn't come here for
frivolous banter either.

606
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,805
I apologize. This is
how he talks.

607
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,442
I think it was...

608
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,778
in January the year before last.

609
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,014
She told me she was

610
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,583
seeing a man she was
intending to marry.

611
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,685
It's been two-and-a-half
years since then.

612
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,154
She's of good age now
to get married, and yet...

613
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,056
she's been too busy with work,

614
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,091
and nothing further developed.

615
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:07,926
I was never introduced to him.

616
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,797
I'm from the old world.

617
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:15,100
Therefore I believe that
girls, when they marry,

618
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,735
I mean, "women"...

619
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,238
should become
part of a household.

620
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,042
This has nothing to do with job
superiors and subordinates.

621
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,843
Nothing to do with wages
being higher or lower.

622
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,378
Those are separate issues.

623
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,048
A man must shoulder
responsibility.

624
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,485
I hope Masakazu-kun
has the will to do so.

625
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,554
Well of course.

626
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,890
Isn't that so?
That's his intention.

627
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,394
Bro's ears are bright red.

628
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,530
Yutori-chan.

629
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:48,667
I'm not expecting
an immediate reply.

630
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:49,668
- Missus.
- Yes?

631
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,836
May I borrow a
brush-pen?

632
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,438
A brush-pen?

633
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,306
Brush-pen... brush-pen...

634
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,010
What are you up to?

635
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,878
Oh, I bought this

636
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,647
gift yesterday

637
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,948
at a department store.

638
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,883
It's a little too soon...

639
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:07,419
What do you mean?
It's not too soon.

640
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,555
Because, like you said...

641
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,423
he hasn't given
you a reply yet.

642
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,425
Oh yeah.

643
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,893
I'll take the brush-pen,

644
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,628
and write this and that
in the registry.

645
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,364
You can think about
it while I do that.

646
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,132
- Brush-pen.
- Yes.

647
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,667
Oh no, I gave it to him.

648
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,168
Hey, just a second.

649
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,337
Relax, dad.

650
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,972
You're jumping the gun.

651
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,942
Besides, the situation is
reversed to begin with.

652
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,344
The groom's family is
supposed to make the preparation.

653
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,679
- What?
- Yes.

654
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,648
This is all because you're
uncommitted...

655
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:39,151
That's right, Masakazu.

656
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,486
What are your thoughts?

657
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,322
Say something.

658
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,003
I do love...

659
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:00,639
Akane-san.

660
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,614
However...

661
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,683
I hate her father.

662
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,818
Idiot!

663
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,319
Because he...

664
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,988
barges in all of a sudden...

665
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,056
He asks about my family,
he asks about my siblings,

666
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,858
he asks about my work; but he
asks nothing about me.

667
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,627
What kind of person am I?

668
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,129
What are my thoughts? Those
things don't matter at all to you?

669
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,298
I'm the one getting married here.

670
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,333
My family, siblings, work,

671
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,968
my surroundings got
nothing to do with it.

672
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,770
Furthermore...

673
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,505
you don't ask about your
daughter's feelings...

674
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,107
what are her concerns?

675
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:38,043
Yet you tell her to choose work or
marriage, just because she's of age.

676
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,345
I don't get it.

677
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,548
But that, you see...

678
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,483
unless the both of you
get fully committed...

679
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,418
things won't move forward.

680
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,187
Of course it won't move forward.

681
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,291
Because we're not a couple.

682
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,593
What are you talking about?

683
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,362
I'm sorry.

684
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,600
We have broken up.

685
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,438
- Is that true?
- Yes.

686
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,507
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,376
What?

688
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:12,978
In that case...

689
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,279
what are we doing here?

690
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,248
We're no longer a couple
so I'll go ahead and say it...

691
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,151
Miyashita-san was given a
promotion and transfer.

692
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,520
She was at a loss because
I'm the way I am.

693
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,822
- That's not true.
- Let me talk.

694
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,226
I got to hate myself
eventually...

695
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,928
I severed my Achilles' heel...

696
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,130
and finally we decided to
break up for now.

697
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,734
Wrong. Totally wrong.

698
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,170
I didn't want to break up.

699
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,874
What are we doing here?

700
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,347
I wanted to marry you.

701
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,916
Whether I become a homemaker,

702
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,718
or choose to continue
my career...

703
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,220
I was putting the decision off
till later.

704
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:57,956
I wanted to marry first,

705
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,225
and become happy.

706
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,461
I wanted to become happy,

707
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,862
and...

708
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,466
"Oh no, we're broke.
Who'll go to work?"

709
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,902
That would have been
fine for me.

710
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:10,903
It's not that simple.

711
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:11,904
Why?

712
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,639
It's okay for us, but...

713
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,507
what about our surroundings?

714
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,776
I told you I don't care
about our surroundings.

715
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,044
But...

716
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,379
That's why...

717
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,848
that's what I'm talking about.

718
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,083
Forget it.

719
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,554
- Akane.
- Idiot!

720
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,928
Wow...

721
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,262
I had no idea this distillery

722
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,298
has such a reputable history.

723
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,966
Outstanding, outstanding.

724
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,468
When I was kid,

725
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,071
we'd play hide and seek here.
My dad yelled at us for that.

726
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,675
What a nice smell it has.

727
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,143
It could make you tipsy.

728
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,612
Um...

729
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,948
you have come such a long way...

730
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,149
Oh.

731
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,550
It's my fault;

732
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,185
I jumped the gun.

733
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,187
But anyway...

734
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,723
my daughter sure
is strong willed.

735
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,758
I wonder who she took after?

736
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,929
I was hoping she'd look after me
in my senior days...

737
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,197
but it doesn't seem likely.

738
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,433
My life span will shrink.

739
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,715
Oh well...

740
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,150
I'll be going back alone.

741
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,885
I will accompany you
to the station.

742
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,554
Don't bother,
that's all right.

743
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,190
I'd feel awkward,
just you and me.

744
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,526
I understand.
I'm sorry.

745
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,096
Masakazu-kun.

746
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,798
When you young folks see

747
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,300
old fogies like me,

748
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,068
do you think to yourselves:
"We've won"?

749
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:51,670
Huh?

750
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,139
You must feel superior to us.

751
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,542
Whenever we fogies see

752
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,478
young folks, we think

753
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,647
without rhyme or reason:
"We've lost"!

754
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,249
Although I know

755
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,752
you folks don't think in terms
of winning, but...

756
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:07,919
we, of our own accord...

757
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,855
feel inferior to you folks.

758
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,526
You folks don't know anything yet.

759
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,563
You don't fear what you
don't know either.

760
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:21,566
Fear...

761
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,068
it's a menacing thing.

762
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,437
We elderly folk call you
the millennial generation...

763
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,839
we make sweeping
generalizations

764
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,108
because we fear you;

765
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,444
we can't look you
straight in the face.

766
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,581
The logogram of
'shame' is...

767
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,384
written with 'ear'
and 'heart'.

768
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:42,587
Back in there...

769
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,924
when you were
expressing your ire to me...

770
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,694
I felt shame and anger.

771
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,096
My ears turned bright red.

772
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,933
But since I'm young, I have to
experience humbling things;

773
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,103
I have to turn my ears and heart
bright red, more and more.

774
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,773
I have to. Isn't that so?

775
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,376
Hm?

776
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:05,811
No, never mind.

777
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,790
In appointment of Ms.
Miyashita Akane

778
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,793
on the last day of June, 2016...

779
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,528
has been relieved of her
duties

780
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:26,031
of branch-management in the
Setagaya district...

781
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,065
and has been appointed

782
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,134
the leader of the project

783
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,002
of development of
the new Sendai branch.

784
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,805
- Thank you very much.
- Do your best.

785
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,011
In appointment of Mr.
Sakama Masakazu,

786
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,713
he has been relieved of
duties

787
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,381
of store manager
at "Tori no Tami"

788
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,150
and has been appointed

789
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,919
the general area manager of all
branches in the Setagaya district.

790
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,789
- I'm area manager?
- That's right.

791
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,958
Our business will revive.

792
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,960
Thank you very much.

793
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,165
Oh. Go to Koenji now.

794
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,606
Everybody from the main office
is a store manager.

795
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,008
But I don't know if I'll
call you that or not...

796
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,012
In any case, whenever we use
the term "store manager"...

797
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,648
we're actually making fun of them.

798
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,552
I look forward to working
with you.

799
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,756
I'm interviewing a part-timer at
4:00, so I'll train you till then.

800
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:26,892
Yes.

801
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,239
Isn't that your friend,
Yamaji-sensei?

802
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,309
Excuse me! Excuse me!

803
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,445
No, first you ask the customer:
"Are you hurt?"

804
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,648
Are you hurt?

805
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,516
What's the point of asking me?

806
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,819
Never mind. Help
with the orders.

807
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,020
Yes.

808
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:57,789
Hey, Sakama, Sakama.

809
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,191
Sorry I can't right now.

810
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,792
Nakamori-kun, please
arrange the skewered assortment.

811
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,527
One order of skewered
assortment coming up.

812
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,929
- Store manager.
- Yeah.

813
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,530
Um, the real store manager.

814
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,465
Who cut the turnips?

815
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,667
I did.

816
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,069
The turnips are cut
to 2.5 cm.

817
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,504
Longer, shorter...

818
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,805
shorter, longer...

819
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,607
super longer!

820
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:16,842
Do it over.

821
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,343
- Yes.
- Hey, hey.

822
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,712
Has Maribu-kun been
around lately?

823
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,515
Come to think of it, he hasn't
been here once this whole week.

824
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,419
Hey, newbie.

825
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,388
- Keep a firm grip on the ladder.
- I'm sorry.

826
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,025
You have a weird
first name too, guy.

827
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,801
Sorry about that.

828
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,375
- Gardener?
- He's an apprentice or something.

829
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,143
Maribu? You got
to be kidding.

830
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:53,845
He's not kidding!

831
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,947
He said he's going legit...

832
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,417
he abandoned the
bar and all...

833
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,820
he's not there anymore!

834
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:03,488
What's he talking about?

835
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,390
Excuse me!

836
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,292
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

837
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,293
Excuse us.

838
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,261
Huh?

839
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:10,729
I just heard a girl's voice.

840
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,430
She's the new part-timer.

841
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,099
What? Wait a sec...

842
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,601
What? What is this?

843
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,803
I figured I would see you
if I worked here...

844
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:20,805
and I'd get paid hourly
wages for it.

845
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,674
Store manager, will you
move out of the way?

846
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,643
Excuse me...

847
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,044
Really, though...

848
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,178
what's going on here?

849
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,648
And also, starting July,
I'm the area manager.

850
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:32,484
So I'm telling you...

851
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,720
I chose work over marriage
this time, but...

852
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:40,425
it's not that I've
given up on marriage.

853
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,530
I'm an eligible date,
believe it or not.

854
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,332
Sure, sure, I understand.

855
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,402
Think of it as adding to your
marriage endeavors, then.

856
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:51,469
What?

857
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,838
Going to Sendai?

858
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,107
Not a bad way to look at it.

859
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,677
Like Date Masamune
or something.

860
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,014
Oh boy...

861
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,050
my head...

862
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:06,685
isn't banging all pistons...

863
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:07,852
but still...

864
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,089
such was my timing...

865
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,058
to sever the rotten relationship.

866
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,859
Sure.

867
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,428
You know...

868
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:20,465
he got promoted to
area manager...

869
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,301
it's like he's got me
to thank for it.

870
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,736
That's how it is.

871
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,171
Yeah.

872
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,640
You know...

873
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,108
Yes, thank you very much.

874
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,481
Excuse me.

875
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,650
Oh, sorry.

876
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,186
Excuse us.

877
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,226
You know...

878
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,132
Woops... huh?

879
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,970
Am I drunk, or...

880
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,439
am I trying to get drunk?

881
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,208
I'm totally confused.

882
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,010
Totally confused.

883
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,812
Maybe you should
have a glass of water.

884
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,016
Appreciate it.

885
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,218
Excuse me. One
glass of water please.

886
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:15,820
Um, Hayakawa-san.

887
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:18,790
Don't tell me...

888
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,793
What is it?

889
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,129
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:32,303
Hayakawa-san, are you feeling

891
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:34,105
like it right now?

892
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:38,109
I'm sort of feeling like it.

893
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,684
Well, me too.

894
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,393
If you want to pretend it was
a joke, I can go along with it.

895
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,795
Now's the last chance.

896
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,430
Now.

897
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:01,733
I'm fine.

898
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:05,637
At times like this...

899
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:07,806
what am I supposed to say?

900
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:09,507
A clinching one-liner?

901
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,778
I know.

902
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,282
"Let's take a little break here."

903
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,563
You're the last, so drain the tub
after you're done.

904
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,068
What if...

905
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:39,104
Huh?

906
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,474
I were to get married...

907
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,677
and manage the
distillery the with you...

908
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:47,879
What do you think?

909
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,015
Never mind.

910
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,524
If you're reluctant to
continue the heritage...

911
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:00,759
I'd rather shut it down.

912
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:01,926
Who cars about this
booze warehouse?

913
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,428
Good morning,
Miyashita-kun.

914
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:04,863
Good morning,
division chief.

915
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:07,098
There are some things virgins
know more about.

916
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,333
Maribu-san!

917
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,734
What happened?

918
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:12,237
I'm quitting my job
and getting married.
