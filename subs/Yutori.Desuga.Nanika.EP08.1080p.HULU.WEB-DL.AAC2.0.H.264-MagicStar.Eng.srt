1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,774
Get up, Yutori-chan.
Come downstairs.

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,476
What is it?

3
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,421
Come on, Yutori-chan.

4
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,989
What?

5
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,629
What? What time is it?

6
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,432
One in the afternoon... no,
it's night?

7
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,800
Well, Masakazu...

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,970
has an important
announcement for us.

9
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:37,838
Well...

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,975
I was thinking of getting married.

11
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,243
What?

12
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,178
You should get married.

13
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,846
But there's one more thing.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,848
Yeah...

15
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,286
I was wondering about continuing
the distillery with my brother...

16
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,854
that maybe I should.

17
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,258
What? Are you serious?

18
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,428
But you don't have to
quit your job for that.

19
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,964
That's right, you finally got back
to work and things are looking up.

20
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:08,803
But I thought it's perfect timing
to quit, without feeling bad.

21
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,005
My brother's having a tough time
running our business by himself.

22
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,473
No, I...

23
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,477
That's true.

24
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,347
You have better rapport with
the workers too.

25
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,816
That's right.

26
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,851
If Masakazu-san were to take on
succession of the business...

27
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,855
Wait a second here. I'm talking
about

28
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,490
working together with my brother.

29
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,493
No, no. Don't say that.

30
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,895
You should do it.

31
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,564
What do you mean "I" should do it?

32
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,232
What is this?

33
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,267
What are you two scheming?

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,275
Actually...

35
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,278
I have...

36
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,481
been thinking about this.

37
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,151
That I am no
company-president material.

38
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,453
You don't want to be one?

39
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,089
-That's not it...
-You want to quit?

40
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,862
I want to quit!

41
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,899
You quit, then what?

42
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,267
I want to...

43
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,869
leave home.

44
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,879
Is that your wife?

45
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,946
No.

46
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,282
Come on, shut up.

47
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,851
You were right about the shower.

48
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,119
The shower head was loose.

49
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,388
Right? It was like this.

50
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,857
Why are you in your shirt?

51
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,926
Oh, um...

52
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,427
I'm having a drink.

53
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,695
Sure.

54
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,465
Say, Miyashita...

55
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,734
this thing we're doing...

56
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,736
This is my first time
with a married man.

57
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:54,308
Oh... you just broke up with your
colleague, Sakama-kun...

58
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,976
and now you're with
your superior...

59
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,678
Say what you will, I don't care.

60
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,847
I'm going to Sendai anyway.

61
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,682
What?

62
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,285
Isn't that why you
brought me here?

63
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,287
Miyashita.

64
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,990
It'll only be once, right?

65
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,492
Be quiet.

66
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,260
Miyashita...

67
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:17,932
stop vocalizing
everything I'm feeling.

68
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,867
I want to become a farmer.

69
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,270
Specifically, a rice farmer.

70
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,839
After 3/11,

71
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,676
their whole family moved
to Hokkaido.

72
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,477
They learned it from scratch.

73
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,314
They started to grow rice.
Look at this land.

74
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,682
My friend cultivated all of it.

75
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,849
All in five years.

76
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,519
Property is cheap up there,
living is easy too.

77
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,487
I've heard enough.

78
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,856
I understand well now.

79
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,492
The both of you couldn't
handle anything:

80
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,928
the distillery, having a child,
and me...

81
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,898
That's not what I'm saying.

82
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,300
My obstetrician agreed
with the idea.

83
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,602
They said living in a

84
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,837
nice environment without
stress will stimulate pregnancy.

85
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,807
"Stimulate pregnancy,
Stimulate pregnancy..."

86
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,276
you make it sound as if
I'm pressuring you.

87
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,680
Did I ever say I wanted a
grandchild? I never did, not once.

88
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,483
I want a baby.

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,656
I don't want to fight, Midori-san...

90
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,057
I'm fine with it.

91
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,393
You're going to start a farm...

92
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,196
it's not going to be as
easy as it sounds.

93
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:25,466
Professional farmers have had
it tough all their lives.

94
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,368
That's okay by me. I'll take
over the business, mother.

95
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,136
No, "that's okay I'll do it"
isn't good enough.

96
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
It's: "Please allow me to run it!"

97
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,107
What a joke...

98
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,276
I'd rather shut the business down
than have you do it reluctantly.

99
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm authorized to shut this
lousy distillery down.

100
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,715
"Perfect timing to quit
without feeling bad"?

101
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,852
I wasn't waiting for your timing.

102
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,462
This is the pits.

103
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,864
Morning, Miyashita-kun.

104
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,566
Good morning, division chief.

105
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,369
I saw May's balance report.

106
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,071
It's going well.

107
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,674
Yes. As each shop exuded its
own personality...

108
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,276
the favorable results finally
showed up in the figures.

109
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,879
But it seems the sales
on weekdays....

110
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,348
isn't rising very well.

111
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,519
Then maybe we should go
all out and start serving lunch!

112
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,678
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

113
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,850
-Good morning.
-Morning.

114
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,619
Oh, sorry.

115
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,488
Time to make rounds
to the shops, right?

116
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,760
Mind if we waited till the
afternoon? I'm swamped here.

117
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,505
-Morning, Miyashita-kun.
-Good morning, division chief.

118
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,774
I saw May's balance report.

119
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,342
It's going well.

120
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,144
Yes. As each shop exuded
its own personality...

121
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,546
the favorable results finally
showed up in the figures.

122
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,850
But it seems the sales on
weekdays isn't rising too well.

123
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,919
Then maybe we should go
all out and start serving lunch!

124
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,189
Lunch, eh? That's a good idea, it'll
help us beat our competition.

125
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,158
Okay, I need an estimate...
What?

126
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,695
Oh, um, I got your call
last night, so...

127
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,864
Oh.

128
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,867
I returned the call because
I thought it might be urgent, but...

129
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,870
Oh, sorry about that.

130
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,072
I fell asleep.

131
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,676
Lunch, eh...

132
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,280
That's a good idea.

133
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,698
I wonder about that.

134
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,736
-If it were a business district...
-Oyako-don,

135
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,005
karaage lunch,
and also chicken curry.

136
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,573
Those will never be profitable.

137
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,476
If we're open from 12 to 2, will you
have time to prepare for dinner?

138
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,611
-Easily.
-That's impossible.

139
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,813
So at the outset,

140
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,881
let's just go with a limit of 50
servings and see how it goes.

141
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,516
Okay.

142
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,051
By the way, I'm allergic to eggs.

143
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,053
Work instead of
flapping your mouth.

144
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,221
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,924
Which one is the
unsweetened coffee?

146
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,759
-This one?
-It's sugarless.

147
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,260
-This one?
-Mildly sweetened.

148
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,462
-This one?
-That's got sugar.

149
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,366
I'm sorry, I wasn't sure what you
wanted so I bought one of each.

150
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,802
That's the trouble with
you millennials.

151
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,137
In the first place...

152
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,840
why are these all hot?

153
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,841
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,076
Kitazawa-san.

155
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,945
-I heard you're coming back.
-Starting next week.

156
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,280
I lost it all on horse races again.

157
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,649
-Again?
-Is he a newbie?

158
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,285
I'm Michigami.
Nice to meet you.

159
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:06,687
Hey.

160
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,224
Also, is Yamaji-sensei a virgin?

161
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,491
He's a virgin.

162
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,862
Erm... What?

163
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,864
Why did you ask that?

164
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,298
And why did you answer,
Ota-sensei?

165
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:21,368
Woops, sorry about that.

166
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,438
I thought it'd be better to
talk about it casually.

167
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,773
You know, there will be sex
education classes in the 4th grade.

168
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,842
It's about the birds
and the bees.

169
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:29,977
I know that.

170
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,178
Of course I know that.

171
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,846
Let me ask you casually...

172
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,048
-do you think you can teach it?
-He can't.

173
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,817
Why are you answering,
Ota-sensei?

174
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,486
-You'll teach in the 2nd semester.
-Oh, the 2nd semester.

175
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,855
-Can you do it?
-He can't.

176
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,860
-I can do it.
-You can do it.

177
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:51,932
Sex education eh?
Brings back memories.

178
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,467
Back in my day...

179
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,369
it was for girls only...

180
00:08:55,469 --> 00:09:00,807
It was a secretive class held
in the audiovisual room.

181
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,076
But it's co-ed now, eh?

182
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,047
But there is a problem. Not just the
faculty, but students and guardians

183
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,385
all know the fact that
I am inexperienced.

184
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,986
Because of that Shizuma!

185
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,222
Shut up, virgin!

186
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,157
Shut up, virgin!

187
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,326
Shut up, virgin!

188
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,767
Well, there are only two
ways you can go.

189
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:31,171
One is to teach class at the same,
unknowledgeable level as the kids...

190
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,840
Impossible, the kids know a lot.
Possibly even more than me.

191
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,244
The other way is to throw
it all away.

192
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,845
No, I can't do that either.

193
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,548
You talk of it like it's
trash or something.

194
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,151
But I've come this far,
it's a treasure to me.

195
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,286
Remember that movie...

196
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,223
of tighrope walking from one
building to another?

197
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,758
It's like that movie.

198
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,828
I've only got a few more steps
before I reach the other building.

199
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,463
But if it were any other
one of you,

200
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,266
you would've already fallen.

201
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,839
Oh, I have to go now.

202
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,275
For crying out loud...

203
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,878
I feel foolish spending my money
here and raising my voice...

204
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,947
I think it's beautiful.

205
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,549
If my son had...

206
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,219
just one-tenth of your
virtuous spirit...

207
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,855
He'd never have illicit affairs...

208
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,490
Huh?

209
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,258
-What?
-What?

210
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,495
-Please don't tell Sakama-kun!
-Welcome!

211
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,264
-You're talking to him.
-Welcome.

212
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:33,867
That's right.

213
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,769
I'll do that over again.

214
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:36,837
What's it about?

215
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,172
Aso-san told me.

216
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,274
-About Maribu and Yutori-chan...
-Yamaji-san!

217
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,512
How'd you find a nice place?
Not bad for a millennial.

218
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,381
I heard you have a daughter,
Michigami-san.

219
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,849
-Oh, yes.
-You do?

220
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,851
-Can I try to guess her name?
-Sure.

221
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,487
She's the daughter of
"Maribu," so...

222
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,523
-"Rurubu"?
-No, even I wouldn't name her that.

223
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,492
-Wrong!
-Compliments of the proprietor.

224
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,495
-Seriously?
-Yes. Excuse me.

225
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,930
No, not this guy.
He's over there...

226
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,133
I'm sorry!

227
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,935
-I'm sorry.
-You apologized before bumping in.

228
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:09,836
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,139
Never mind.

230
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,676
Hey, hey.

231
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,177
Are you sure?

232
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,845
-My sister?
-Yeah.

233
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,049
Forget about that.

234
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,018
Oh, sensei!

235
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,254
-Welcome.
-Here I am.

236
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,859
Welcome.

237
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,262
Welcome.

238
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,696
Welcome.

239
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,437
We have a new customer.

240
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,138
Please take the booth in the back.

241
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,343
You're still here?

242
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,480
Sorry, it's voluntary overtime.

243
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:54,981
Um,

244
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,017
that's not what I mean...

245
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,951
What?

246
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,589
Never mind.

247
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,859
Good job.

248
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,262
Good job.

249
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,838
That was awkward.

250
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,479
The total is...

251
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,851
5,628,000 yen.

252
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,486
That's impossible, you idiot!

253
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,854
-Do it again.
-I'm sorry.

254
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,255
I hear you got promoted.

255
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,492
It wasn't a big deal.

256
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,861
I'm making an effort too.

257
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,464
How's your sister doing?

258
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,700
Huh?

259
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,535
Hey Maribu.

260
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,070
-Let's go to the next place.
-Okay.

261
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,506
Thank you very much.

262
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,108
The customers are leaving.

263
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,277
Thank you very much.

264
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,115
She can't reply, she's
working right now.

265
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,850
She can read it later.

266
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,853
-Excuse me.
-Yes, I'll be right there.

267
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,490
I heard you cheated on her?

268
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,860
-So what?
-Not "so what."

269
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,264
Thank you for waiting.

270
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,399
What can I do for you?

271
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,701
A refill of the draft...

272
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,403
just one...

273
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:26,406
-should do.
-Understood.

274
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,848
Why did you show up here,
where she's working?

275
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,284
-You trying to impress her?
-You know...

276
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,520
you sound like you've never
been dumped before.

277
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:50,130
-Never have.
-I see... so this was your first.

278
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,401
You go out, cheat, then cheat
again on your cheating partner.

279
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,137
-And you've never been dumped?
-Never have.

280
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,340
-I'm way poplar.
-"Popular."

281
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,742
Sorry.

282
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,047
I said "popular."

283
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,283
In any case, I wasn't dumped.

284
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,052
You were dumped.

285
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,653
No matter what...

286
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,489
you should feel down about it
like a normal person.

287
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,859
Listen...

288
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,328
you shouldn't obsess over it.

289
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,063
You have to face the facts.

290
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,398
You need to learn that...

291
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,200
there are some things
you just can't change

292
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,868
no matter how hard you try.

293
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,472
-Vir-...
-Virgins know a thing or two too.

294
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,474
Don't get so full of yourself,
"fashion glasses".

295
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,276
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,745
"Fashion glasses"...

297
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,285
Hey, when did they bring these?

298
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,493
Up to here is fine.

299
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,061
You sure?

300
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,265
If you feel worried call me,
I'll come walk you home.

301
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,867
I might call even if I don't
feel worried.

302
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,703
Etsuko-sensei...

303
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,674
J-just a second...

304
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,277
Oh...

305
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,046
Uh...

306
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,387
Oh!

307
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,522
Look there!

308
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:23,890
"Sex Education for Children"

309
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,893
-Look, it's Saito Takumi!
-No way!

310
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,695
Isn't that so?

311
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:29,796
Um...

312
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,698
I'm not sure if it is.

313
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,740
-Welcome home.
-I'm home.

314
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,348
Masakazu is far more stable.

315
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,683
Like I said...

316
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,052
I'll come back to train
the workers.

317
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,321
Don't bother.

318
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,989
I'm shutting down the distillery.

319
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,224
I can run the business
from Hokkaido too.

320
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,061
I can take internet orders
on my PC.

321
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,064
-Please tell her, Midori.
-Mother.

322
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,599
You haven't seen the accounting
book lately, have you?

323
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,702
I haven't since father died.

324
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,070
What about it?

325
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,073
If you look at this, you'll see that
he's unfit to do business.

326
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,574
I think you'll be convinced.

327
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,677
-Midori.
-Sorry, I had to say it.

328
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,882
Bro...

329
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,319
How much do you know about
my boyfriend?

330
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:27,987
Huh?

331
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,890
Well, it doesn't matter,
we broke up.

332
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,529
I see.

333
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,698
I wonder why.

334
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,936
Why do you wonder why?

335
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,105
It was my fault.

336
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,841
It was my fault.

337
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,644
Yutori-chan, if you went to a
college that accepts you...

338
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,347
and get hired where they'd hire
you... is that good enough for you?

339
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,117
-I can't take it anymore.
-Don't give up!

340
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,219
I don't know how many
interviews you've had, but...

341
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,987
it'd be a waste to give up now.

342
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,232
But I passed the interview.

343
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,901
-And then, I dunno...
-You woke up.

344
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,304
-It's not as attractive anymore.
-That's not true.

345
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,675
That's not true...

346
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,112
at least I tell myself
that's not true.

347
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,684
I've been running away from
reality, then suddenly...

348
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,321
I realized how childish I've been.

349
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,894
Like the goofy things I've done;
childish words and actions...

350
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,930
I remember those things
whenever I see him.

351
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,100
And now even he seems goofy.

352
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,906
I think he's doing what he can...

353
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,308
to change; isn't that so?

354
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,679
It's not that I'm taking

355
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,681
your boyfriend's side,

356
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,150
but maybe he's realized
you've changed,

357
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,952
and has been trying to
match you.

358
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,086
That kind of thing...

359
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,190
I never expected him
to be normal.

360
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,425
He's certainly not normal.

361
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,527
-Huh?
-Oh, nothing.

362
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,699
As long as you know...

363
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,568
that it's your fault.

364
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,303
Yeah.

365
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,112
What about you?

366
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,515
What?

367
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,522
Are you okay?

368
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,095
I'm okay.

369
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,504
We talked so much my
noodles got dry.

370
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,883
My dear...

371
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,523
Sorry, sorry sorry. Silly me...

372
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,025
I thought it was the
immigration bureau.

373
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,094
-Immigration bureau?
-Never mind.

374
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,129
Hey, Yama-chan.

375
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,398
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, this...

376
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,300
What? You working
part time?

377
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,268
No, I...

378
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,069
Collecting cans?

379
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,673
Oh, sorry, sorry.
That was my fault.

380
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,308
There we go.

381
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,977
I'm not staying long.

382
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,113
Sorry, I have to get up early.

383
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,648
Yama!

384
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,849
Yama!

385
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,884
"How dare you disturb
us in the middle of the night!"

386
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,188
"You brought alcohol?
Have you no common sense?"

387
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,722
"Huh? You idiot."

388
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,658
She's totally welcoming you.

389
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,326
She is, really?

390
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,529
-What is it?
-Well, um...

391
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,765
I can't say it in front of her...

392
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,700
This is unthinkable.

393
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,571
Oh, well...

394
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,440
It's fine if you use something
other than Chinese or Japanese.

395
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,880
"Well, I happened to
hear something..."

396
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,449
"About you and..."

397
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,985
She already knows about
Yutori-chan.

398
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:23,022
But it ended before Yutori-chan
learned about them.

399
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,692
All over?

400
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,695
That's the promise I
made to Sakama.

401
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,532
And I was able to
fulfill my promise.

402
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,435
I even changed jobs while
I was at it.

403
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,904
Of course I never thought
I'd get dumped.

404
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,105
Oh...

405
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,911
He's awesome.

406
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:46,879
Sakama-kun?

407
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,351
He knows what's precious
to him.

408
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:56,322
He fights for it tooth and nail
in the trenches.

409
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,691
You know...

410
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,328
what I like about that shop...

411
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,632
is watching Sakama work.

412
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,101
Oh, at "Tori no Tami"?

413
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,304
I wanted to show that to my
coworkers today.

414
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,108
They say "millenial this" and
"millenial that," but...

415
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,911
you can be a millennial, and yet
be so unlike a millennial.

416
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,682
He tackles all kinds of things...

417
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,384
he breaks dishes...

418
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,718
he gets yelled at by his
part timers...

419
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,655
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, I'm changing the sauce.

420
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,857
He got the salt and sauce wrong
and tried to wash it in the sink.

421
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,160
Guys like that are rare.

422
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,129
He doesn't fit the mold.

423
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,530
That's true.

424
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,700
But he's awesome.

425
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,337
As I watched him...

426
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,673
I got inspired to do
something too.

427
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,177
It's no time for me to be
finding myself.

428
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,279
You've been trying to
find yourself?

429
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,515
All the while as I
barked at customers.

430
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,017
But I quit.

431
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,319
I sold all my self-help books.

432
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:06,192
I don't know if gardening is
something I want to pursue, but...

433
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:07,894
I enjoy the challenge.

434
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:12,699
And the beer and yakitori after
work at Sakama's are delicious.

435
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,967
There's no doubt about that.

436
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,537
There's no doubt, all right.

437
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,106
I have to make an effort.

438
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,308
For their sake too.

439
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,744
He's finally come back.

440
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,713
I thought you forgot about us.

441
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,284
Hey Yama. What are
you doing here, anyway?

442
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,119
At last...

443
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,088
my son...

444
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,824
has been released from the curse...

445
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,526
-...of the Michigami family.
-Curse?

446
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:42,328
You see...

447
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,299
He has a half-brother that's older.

448
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,701
He's an attorney.

449
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,804
They're like cats and dogs.

450
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,574
-It's my fault, of course.
-I'm sure it is.

451
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:58,978
He didn't give up on college
entrance exams because

452
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,114
he was competing with his
4 years older brother.

453
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,548
But now...

454
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:06,018
we no longer live in an academic-
degree oriented society.

455
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:10,089
Right? It's okay if he lives by
different values.

456
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,524
You too, Yamaji-san...

457
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,392
Me too what?

458
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:16,229
Oh, uh...

459
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,898
Don't try to distract me. What were
you going to say about my values?

460
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,733
-Isn't that heavy? I can carry it.
-I'm fine.

461
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:21,768
I'll do it.

462
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,269
It's okay, I'm fine.

463
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,238
Never mind.

464
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:27,306
-Never mind.
-It's okay.

465
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,112
Lunches are doing well.

466
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,047
Thank you very much.

467
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,283
I think the limited menu
was a good idea.

468
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,951
We're sold out before 1:00 PM
on consecutive days.

469
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,323
Can you increase it to 100
orders starting next week?

470
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,092
Yes.

471
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,004
We've been together all
day lately.

472
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,105
What?

473
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,577
Oh... you're right.

474
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,046
They're gossiping in the office
pantry that we're an item.

475
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,148
They don't know we're finished.

476
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,519
Right. We're here for work.

477
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,328
I wonder if I should go to Sendai.

478
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,698
It doesn't feel real at all.

479
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,675
Ignoring me, huh?

480
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,112
No...

481
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,115
you're going, aren't you?

482
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,318
Afterall, it's a promotion.

483
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,890
We have to get up early tomorrow.
Spend the night at my place.

484
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,095
You need instructions for
lunch, don't you?

485
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,400
-Yeah, but...
-"Yeah but"...

486
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,937
I'm fine. I'm confident nothing
will happen if you spent the night.

487
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,506
-Right?
-Not "right."

488
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,943
-This isn't good, we're lingering.
-No, even if we lingered,

489
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:14,313
nothing will become of it.

490
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,853
Yamaji said...

491
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:25,091
that women will change. Even
though if he's never done it.

492
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,895
But I won't change. I'll be as if
nothing happened tomorrow.

493
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,097
"Sakama-san, your placement of
revenue stamps is sloppy!"

494
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,098
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,101
See? I haven't changed.

496
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:42,108
What about me? Have I changed
since we broke up?

497
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,512
I dunno...

498
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,882
Parts of you I didn't want changed
didn't change.

499
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,521
-I see.
-That wasn't good enough?

500
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,089
No...

501
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,893
I thought maybe I've changed.

502
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,096
Because of the
Nogami-san situation.

503
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,533
If we concealed it, our company's
image would've been tarnished.

504
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,735
But Hayakawa-san decision...

505
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,672
to have a public apology
was praiseworthy.

506
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:16,509
I too...

507
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,512
for the first time, felt that I
wanted to protect the company.

508
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,882
It felt good to bow on
behalf of the company.

509
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:27,320
Dedication to the company?
I used to make fun of that.

510
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:32,525
But it was interesting. I felt
it was worth the effort.

511
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,297
I'll see if your dress shirt
and trousers are still here.

512
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,533
Oh...

513
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,304
Those ladies in the
office pantry...

514
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,273
Yeah?

515
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,509
"I think those two are an item."

516
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:54,880
"Isn't Miyashita having an affair
with division-chief Hayakawa?"

517
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:55,881
What? What?

518
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:00,119
The company. It's nothing but a
gathering of such people.

519
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:06,692
So don't change for the
company's sake, Masakazu.

520
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,907
Thank you very much.

521
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,747
What is it?

522
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,349
Nothing.

523
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,619
Masatoshi.

524
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,454
I'm counting on you.

525
00:27:35,588 --> 00:27:37,123
Hey Maribu, stop
dilly-dallying.

526
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,125
What kind of driving was that?

527
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,329
"... the body becomes sturdy."

528
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,966
"In women..."

529
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:51,737
"...hair begins to
grow under the arms."

530
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,707
"The ches..."

531
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,643
"Ches...t... becomes fuller..."

532
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,750
"The hip area becomes larger..."

533
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,685
"The physique
becomes rounder."

534
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,055
What?

535
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,890
Nothing.

536
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,292
Oh.

537
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,333
Oh no, I made a mistake.
I blew it!

538
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,338
What is this? Is this all the
thigh meat we have left?

539
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,974
Are you for real, store manager?

540
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,843
I already chopped all the scallions.

541
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,212
-We have to cancel lunch!
-I'll go take the sign down.

542
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,547
Huh?

543
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,918
I brought thigh meat!
Here ya go!

544
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,386
Nogami-san? Why?

545
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,422
I ordered it. Thanks for the
fast delivery.

546
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,459
I can't turn Sakama-san down.

547
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,794
This box is on the house.

548
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,329
-Eggs.
-Yes.

549
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:56,936
Here you go.

550
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,906
Thanks.

551
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,345
-This is for you, Murai-san.
-Three customers.

552
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,215
Welcome.

553
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,516
-Ready to go.
-Okay.

554
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,917
-Here you go.
-Okay.

555
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,953
Nakamori-kun, man the
cash register.

556
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,921
Thank you very much.

557
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:16,922
Bill please.

558
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,531
Darn that's good.

559
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,934
Thank you very much.

560
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:33,139
Yikes. I'm sorry, we're sold out.

561
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,842
I'm so sorry.
Lunch has finished.

562
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,311
If I may have your attention
for a moment...

563
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,246
Yes sir.

564
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,414
I would to invite
Miyashita-senpai...

565
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,251
to say a few words!

566
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,988
Aw come on.

567
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,389
All right.

568
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:54,994
Well, today's job is done.

569
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,630
It was my last day
as area manager.

570
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,967
Good job.

571
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:05,704
Sorry. I already saw
this in the locker.

572
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,340
Why didn't you hide it
properly, Yamagishi?

573
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,077
Up till last year, the sales
in this shop...

574
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,747
was the worst in Suginami of
Setagaya.

575
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,350
But now, it's number-one
in the area.

576
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:24,123
Thanks to its fine staff, it's in
top 10 in all 23 districts of Tokyo.

577
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,626
Yay! That's splendid!

578
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,329
Senpai.

579
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,932
Oh. And...

580
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,367
For a year, starting in july,

581
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,137
I'm going to work on the Sendai
-branch project.

582
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,007
"Tori no Tami" will become
even more successful.

583
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,743
My hopes to get married will be
pushed further and further away.

584
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:51,283
So everybody,
pool your energies together,

585
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,952
-and run a solid business.
-Yes.

586
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,353
Well said!

587
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,956
Thank you very much.

588
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,760
Now my successor and new...

589
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:04,530
store manager will speak.
Go ahead.

590
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:06,932
Senpai?

591
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,904
-Oh. Let me finish this.
-You have to do that now?

592
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,473
Huh?

593
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,910
Huh? Well then...

594
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,014
I'm the new store manager.
The man who

595
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,016
will grow if he's showered
with praise.

596
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,751
I'm Yamagishi.

597
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,922
I know I've got some
problems, but...

598
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,758
thanks to my kind senpai...

599
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,561
here I stand.

600
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:41,166
What? Are you crying?

601
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,136
I think I struck a weird nerve.

602
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,507
Then Nogami-san,
you talk.

603
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,909
-Why me?
-Why you?

604
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,745
Because you're an elder.

605
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,446
Well said!

606
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,348
I've got nothing to do with this,
but...

607
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,117
okay...

608
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,119
Hello.

609
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:04,923
I'm Nogami, who caused
a public panic.

610
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,660
I've reopened my business.

611
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:13,132
I'm not going to improper
establishments anymore.

612
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,138
I'm not kidding.
I owe it all to Sakama-san.

613
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:25,944
We live in an age where
mistakes are never forgiven.

614
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,647
But he spared a geezer like me.

615
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,016
Don't, you'll make him cry.

616
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,652
You sure encouraged me,
didn't you?

617
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,456
He said he approved of me
as a human being.

618
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,825
That's why he said he'll
help me out.

619
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,895
What's the matter?

620
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,397
Everybody's making the
store manager cry.

621
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:48,734
Store manager! Thank you for
all you've done for us!

622
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,035
Thank you very much.

623
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,907
Okay new area manager,
pull yourself together.

624
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,443
Everyone still needs to prepare
for the night shift.

625
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,145
Come on.

626
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,017
Area manager.

627
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,719
He's still crying.

628
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:09,655
Uh...

629
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,859
When I was told to work
at the shop,

630
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,228
frankly...

631
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,931
I thought of quitting my job.

632
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,534
That's why I'm telling you to
pull yourself together.

633
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:27,639
But I'm so glad I didn't quit.

634
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,442
I've had good experiences
since then.

635
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,445
Seven dull years in the
workforce...

636
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,649
were redeemed in a matter
of months.

637
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,219
I have no regrets at all.

638
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,426
Nogami-san.

639
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,433
Yamagishi.

640
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,640
Murai-san.

641
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,144
Nakamori-kun.

642
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,448
Sakura-san.

643
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,454
I sincerely
thank you all.

644
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,658
What is this, are you quitting?

645
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,994
-Yes.
-What?

646
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,695
Miyashita-san.

647
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,230
I'm...

648
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,866
quitting my job
and getting married.

649
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,802
What?

650
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,641
-To whom?
-To Akane-chan.

651
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:43,449
Okay everybody. Let's get on
with the preparation!

652
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,653
Wait a second. Senpai,
don't leave us hanging.

653
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,721
You can't wrap it up like that.

654
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,657
I'm not saying it's immediate.

655
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,260
When you come back from Sendai.
I'll wait 3 years, 5 years.

656
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,763
I want to marry you.

657
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:01,366
I've had good work experience.
I have a sense of accomplishment.

658
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,602
All he did was serve 100
bowls of Oyako-don.

659
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,405
Speaking of which, it's
incredibly clean here.

660
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,941
-Is that why you cleaned?
-Yes.

661
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,643
-Thank you, everyone.
-Sakama-san, it's a waste.

662
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:15,113
-You're young; just getting started.
-Getting what started?

663
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,250
I don't know how to answer
that, but...

664
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,019
-Aiming higher, for example.
-Aiming higher than whom?

665
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,022
What are you saying?

666
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,958
You know...

667
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,226
that's what people do.

668
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,661
It's not as if I'm going to
become the company chairman.

669
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,865
I've had enough.

670
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,635
I was surrounded by all you
wonderful folks.

671
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,037
I've been trusted so fully.

672
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,640
How can anything make
me happier,

673
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,975
except to get married?

674
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:44,243
-No!

675
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,246
Don't cry. You should think
this over, senpai.

676
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,848
-Forget it.
-No, I can't.

677
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:52,451
Let's do it.

678
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:56,655
Let's get married.
Right now.

679
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,199
I'm so happy, Masakazu.

680
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,434
I'm so happy.

681
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:16,008
Hey, I've got a bouquet!
Toss!

682
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:19,645
Then...

683
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,481
-... Sendai?
-I'm not going.

684
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,484
I'm quitting my job since
I'm getting married.

685
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,653
I promised my father that.

686
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:30,656
Which means...

687
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,858
that I would...

688
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,994
have to work? What am
I going to do?

689
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,696
What am I going to do?

690
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,165
Don't think about it.
Don't think about it.

691
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,135
No. No, no, no...

692
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,539
I can do it. I can become the
company chairman.

693
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,874
I can do it!

694
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,843
Calm down, Masakazu.
Calm down.

695
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,015
First, we must report it
to the company.

696
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,722
I see...

697
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,023
I'm very sorry.

698
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,859
I know I was just allowed back to
management, but...

699
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,896
Well, it's Miyashita-kun
after all...

700
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:14,433
I know I could never make
her change her mind.

701
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,035
It's too bad.

702
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,872
Thank you for everything.

703
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,774
That went without a hitch.

704
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,443
That's how it is.

705
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,946
I thought he'd fight a little bit,
to keep us from leaving.

706
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,916
We have to tell your mother.

707
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,718
"Retirement Request"

708
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:33,952
"From Miyashita Akane
and Sakama Masakazu"

709
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,621
Their names are side-by-side.

710
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,858
Typical millennials.

711
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,528
You think so too?

712
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,164
You think it's the same as a
bicycle too, boss?

713
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,667
I think so. Of course it is.

714
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,938
There's no similarity at all.

715
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,040
Say, Michigami-kun.

716
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,408
Yes?

717
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,443
We've met before,
haven't we?

718
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,079
-Huh?
-Let's see...

719
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,315
It was at the bar district
of Koenji.

720
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,384
No way, you can't do that.

721
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:08,020
Kitazawa-san, you go to
Koenji for drinks?

722
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,689
Yeah. Although I'll
never go back there again.

723
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,991
You don't remember, Maribu?

724
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,193
I dunno...

725
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,362
I wonder if I should say it...

726
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,365
My junior and I were around there

727
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,367
when we were accosted by a
customer-barker.

728
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,970
-You wanna go, right?
-Let's go, let's go.

729
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:34,680
What?

730
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,651
That was too much!

731
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,121
We were billed 120,000 yen
for edamame beans and bear.

732
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,125
You were a swindler,
weren't you?

733
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:50,328
-No, I'm not. Give me a break.
-No, it was you!

734
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,097
Huh?

735
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,332
Don't lie.

736
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,935
I couldn't forget you,
even if I wanted to.

737
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,537
Afterall, it was only
2 or 3 months ago.

738
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,108
Kitazawa-san. He said that
it wasn't him.

739
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,543
Actually...

740
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:09,514
I had my junior confirm his
picture too.

741
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:19,891
That's right. That's correct.

742
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:26,198
-Yamaji. Yamaji.
-Hey, hey.

743
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,000
What's this dramatic entry,
Akane-chan?

744
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:32,170
What is this, a make out? Hey.

745
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,941
-I got proposed to.
-What?

746
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,810
What? What?
By Sakama-kun?

747
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,580
Of course. Who else
would it be?

748
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,682
Oh my!

749
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:47,119
Amazing. Amazing.

750
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,855
-Who's this? Who's this?
-Oh, this is...

751
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,523
Hello there...

752
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,458
my name is Wakayama.

753
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,862
He's a student in Yamaji-sensei's
class, and...

754
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,333
I quit my job!

755
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,537
You did it!

756
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:35,333
What's up?
Got a problem?

757
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,309
Why don't you bark
something at me?

758
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,113
Go ahead. "Come on in
for a round."

759
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,918
I can't hear you. Say it from
the bottom of your gut.

760
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,122
"Come on in for a round."

761
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,691
You're an idiot.

762
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,893
Con artist.

763
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,944
Hey...

764
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,879
Stop it.

765
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,689
Hey. Hey.

766
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:50,442
"Yamaji"

767
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,514
Hey bro.

768
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:01,753
Oh, hey!

769
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,356
-Maribu-san.
-What?

770
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,459
I'm sorry.

771
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,329
I can't hear you.

772
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,700
There've been a lot of police
searches lately.

773
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:30,982
Congrats.

774
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,585
"Congrats"?

775
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,923
Is that all?
I'm getting married, you know.

776
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,828
I've given it thought,
you know!

777
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:47,399
If I'm going to bow for
a company... We're one too...

778
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,868
So by becoming the successor
of Sakama Wine Distillery,

779
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,736
I should find job satisfaction.

780
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,708
You guys aren't giving a reaction.

781
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,378
Never mind.

782
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:05,050
That's how it is. I will become
the 6th generation successor.

783
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,821
So bro. Go to Hokkaido.

784
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,457
Hokkaido?
Oh yeah. Hokkaido.

785
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,761
-To go farm.
-Farm.

786
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,133
You only live once.

787
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,035
You lose out if you
don't do what you want to do.

788
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,004
Right?

789
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:30,508
What's the matter with
all of you?

790
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,843
Masa-kun...

791
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,045
you can forget about
that idea.

792
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,048
-Forget it?
-Forget about it.

793
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:39,918
-Why?
-Munetaka.

794
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,586
Apologize properly.

795
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,055
Thanks for the meal.

796
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,259
"Maternal Handbook"
-We've got good news too.

797
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,327
Just today...

798
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,129
we got the test results...

799
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,430
Sorry.

800
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,033
I can't go to Hokkaido
to start a farm.

801
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,241
Please have mercy.

802
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,446
What's so funny?

803
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:11,282
Pay up.

804
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,252
This is the standard price here.

805
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,094
Are you the manager?

806
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:28,800
Hey, who the heck are you guys?
What're you doing here?

807
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,302
-What's going on here?
-You're under arrest.

808
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:51,022
Maribu-kun. Anybody home?

809
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,464
It's me, Yamaji.

810
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:05,236
Um... huh?

811
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:09,040
Excuse me. What's your
relation to Michigami-san?

812
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,676
Um...

813
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:17,048
-I'm his friend.
-I'm from the Immigration Bureau.

814
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,859
Only you, his older brother,
can rescue Maribu-kun.

815
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,160
Congratulations on the marriage.

816
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:05,330
I look forward to
our future together.

817
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:06,664
-Oh, oh.
-What?

818
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:07,899
This is unbelievable.

819
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,033
What does "legit" mean?

820
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,736
-Who decides that?
-Why the apology?

821
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,037
Maribu-kun.
