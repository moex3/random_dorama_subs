1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,105
Hello, sorry to call you so late.

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,507
I'm at Maribu-kun's apartment
right now.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,476
Why? Because...

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,844
I can't reach him.
I'm worried.

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,946
Here they come.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,719
- Make way!
- Make way.

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,324
Tonight at 9:00 P.M. in Mitaka
City, Nakano-Suginami districts,

8
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,527
police arrested the 29-year old
manager of a red-light bar

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,630
based on reports of threatening
and blackmailing customers;

10
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:33,768
disturbing the peace with
intimidating customer-barking;

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,505
alleged criminal activities of
fraud and extortion;

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,107
along with two cronies associated
with the red-light establishment,

13
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,910
he was arrested on charges of
obstruction of public duties.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,980
What? The immigration bureau?

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,616
Who is this Yuka?

16
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:49,517
Huh?

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,452
You mean Bin Rin?

18
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,188
Fu Bin Rin.

19
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,857
It's uncertain if
this is even her real name.

20
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:57,858
Tourist visa.

21
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,260
It's expired.

22
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,495
She also gave birth, didn't she?

23
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,065
When a foreigner gives birth in
Japan, within 30 days, they must

24
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,803
apply for a residence permit with
the immigration bureau

25
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,471
and report the birth

26
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,606
to their country of origin
via the embassy or consulate.

27
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:38,866
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

28
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,137
Welcome.

29
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,672
Oh.

30
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,007
Sorry, I know today's
your day off.

31
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,443
Anyway, what's going on?

32
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,245
It's Maribu.
Right now he's...

33
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,649
being detained at the Suginami
Police Station.

34
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,152
I'm not allowed to see him so I'm
not clear on what happened.

35
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,221
But it seems they'd run a
sting operation on his bar.

36
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,355
You're under arrest.

37
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,824
He's not involved anymore; he'd
gone clean. He's a gardener now.

38
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,392
There was trouble at work.

39
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,927
He skipped out and left.

40
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,864
Then unfortunately, he got
caught by the police.

41
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,866
His pub has a history of
victim complaints,

42
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,635
and undercover agents had been
onto them for quite awhile now.

43
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,939
What's going to happen to him?

44
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,241
For intimidation...

45
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,342
he'll get 2 years.

46
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,978
And for attempted extortion, he'll
get under 10 years imprisonment.

47
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,513
What?

48
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,014
He just happened to be there.

49
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,017
It seems the paperwork reflected
him to be the bar manager.

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,352
Can the charges be dropped?

51
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,687
Only an attorney
can answer that.

52
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:35,823
Attorney...

53
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,227
Attorney, eh...

54
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,062
And his wife and child?

55
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,732
Yamaji-san will
care for them...

56
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,135
Yuka-san had "overstayed."

57
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,118
Then, the attorney...

58
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,053
We have to find one fast.

59
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,888
I'm on it already.

60
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:08,822
Who is it?

61
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,359
I've found one, I've found one.
Shut up, for crying out loud...

62
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,727
"Shut up"?

63
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,231
By the way, though the
timing is odd...

64
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:20,201
I heard you're getting married,
congratulations.

65
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,002
Congratulations.

66
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,137
Nothing's happened yet...

67
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,239
Akane-chan was elated; she said
she's a chairman's wife.

68
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,241
So, your older brother
is becoming a farmer?

69
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,176
- Shut up, for crying out loud.
- "Shut up"?

70
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,513
"Maternity Handbook"
- We've got good news of our own.

71
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,783
Which means...

72
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,886
The 6th generation heir will still
be my older brother.

73
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,055
Midori-san is the wife of the
chairman...

74
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,190
it seems.

75
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,226
I'm just his supporter.

76
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,028
I see.

77
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,932
Do you want to reconsider quit-
ting, and go back to work?

78
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,068
Why?

79
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,004
Why? Because...

80
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,074
I'm not marrying you because you
might become a chairman.

81
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:05,379
If you're going to support your
brother, then your supporter

82
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,047
will be your wife's role.

83
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:12,019
I quit my job because I found some-
thing better than work. That's all.

84
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,430
Can I take this frying pan?

85
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,299
It's light and easy to use.

86
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,533
Just buy a new one.

87
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,602
No, I want this one.

88
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:32,640
All right then, go ahead.
You can have it.

89
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,508
I dunno, that's kinda cute.

90
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,343
She is kinda cute.

91
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,345
She said she was having
marriage "pink."

92
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,614
It'll eventually turn blue...

93
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,816
We'll both be unemployed
starting next month.

94
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,319
Too bad you can't be chairman.

95
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,821
Aso-san is late.
Our meeting is at 3:00.

96
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,156
Maybe he's already here.

97
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,357
Huh? The attorney?

98
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,692
Huh?

99
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,929
There and the major contractor
Hayama Steel?

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,033
Your companies have a close
business relationship, don't you?

101
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,234
Therefore...

102
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,002
Crap, crap, he's coming.

103
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,004
There's nothing the police
can do. Ice coffee.

104
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,406
Yes.

105
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,241
Seriously...

106
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,277
Howdy.

107
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,613
I overslept, so...

108
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,449
Evidence that can't be presented
is not evidence.

109
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,018
Seriously.

110
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,155
What? What?

111
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,358
So he is... is he?

112
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,659
Oh, yes.

113
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,962
He is my son...

114
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,533
I told you didn't I?
He's an attorney.

115
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,234
What?

116
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,439
Did you get a tan,
Masanobu-kun?

117
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,507
Riding the waves?

118
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,811
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

119
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,015
I only have 4 minutes to spare.
Please make it brief.

120
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,485
First, I need a retainer
of 300,000 yen.

121
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,254
For winning the case, I will
expect another 300,000 yen.

122
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,056
Of course, expenses are
charged separately.

123
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,259
Wait a second. You're asking his
brother to defend him?

124
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,061
It'll depend on the
agreement.

125
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,064
You were late to the appointment,
which lowers my opinion of you.

126
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,900
I mean, seriously.

127
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,803
You haven't called in ages, and
suddenly this is the call I get?

128
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,306
What kind of father are you?

129
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,240
Please...

130
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,008
When's the last time
I saw you?

131
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,681
It's not funny.

132
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,817
The time...

133
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:25,853
to...

134
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,221
Seat for 4 people.

135
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,856
expose my darkness
has come.

136
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,559
Here? That's a problem.
Go do that in the booth.

137
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,428
When Masanobu
was four...

138
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,263
after I had a big affair...

139
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,232
I married for the second time.

140
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,868
And...

141
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,438
that was... to Hitomi.

142
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,009
She's Maribu's mother.

143
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,578
Huh?

144
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,114
He wouldn't remember anything
if he was only four.

145
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,450
The child wouldn't, but...

146
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,220
the mother would ponder.

147
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:04,191
A step-child and her own
child are utterly different.

148
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:08,095
She tried to raise them equally,
without favouritism...

149
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,897
and that's what got her stressed.

150
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,866
For example, in a running race at
the school sports event,

151
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,601
Masanobu came in 2nd place.

152
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,338
As his mother she wanted
Maribu to also come in 2nd place.

153
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,741
Or 1st place,

154
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:26,780
and simultaneously, she rued her
ego for having wished that.

155
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,183
Yet, 3rd place would
have been unacceptable.

156
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,484
3rd place is no fun.

157
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:35,222
So only 2nd place for both would've
satisfied her sense of equality.

158
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,061
Therefore when he came in 2nd,
she would say in relief...

159
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,896
"I'm so glad."

160
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,700
"Masanobu, Maribu, both of
you did great."

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,036
And because of those words...

162
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,339
Masanobu was deeply hurt.

163
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,341
- Why?
- Refill.

164
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,909
One highball coming up.

165
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,514
Because he was equally praised
when the situation wasn't equal.

166
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,484
"Masanobu you did great!
Maribu you did great too."

167
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,019
That would've been fine.

168
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,490
But to say Masanobu and Maribu
both did great, is not.

169
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,159
How confusing.

170
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,095
Huh? What?

171
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,430
You see...

172
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,068
what took away that
confusion was...

173
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,069
Millennial education.

174
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,637
Exactly.

175
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,573
"Only one"
instead of "number one."

176
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,810
That's right. You can't tell who's
1st in those school races anyway.

177
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,013
Teachers with flags run along
with them to mix it all up.

178
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,186
I wish millennial education had
been applied much sooner.

179
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,023
What? What is it?

180
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,594
I was thinking I'd met
your wife somewhere.

181
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,029
This.

182
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,265
-You mind?
-Go ahead.

183
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,940
What?

184
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,509
That's Aso Hitomi.

185
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,443
Right?

186
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:07,047
Ah, my secret has been revealed.

187
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,382
She's a "Tama Beauty."

188
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,284
I've been a subscriber.

189
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,253
I get a free poster
every year.

190
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,659
So Aso is...

191
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,527
the same "Aso" as Aso Hitomi.

192
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,528
I'm humbled
to say, yes.

193
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,597
She used the name instead
of her maiden name.

194
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,932
To not vex her kids.

195
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,733
Gosh I was a fan.

196
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,736
She debuted as a heroine
in a morning drama.

197
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,938
That was "Kappore-chan."

198
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,239
Right, "Kappore-chan"!

199
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,573
You know your stuff.

200
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,277
But just when her career was
taking off, she got married

201
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,948
to some bubble-refugee flim-flam
real-estate jerk.

202
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,717
I should punch
you for that.

203
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,218
Hey Nakamori-kun.

204
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,853
When was that posted?

205
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,423
I dunno; I think
it's always been there.

206
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,226
As I thought.

207
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,363
He's been coming here
to see his mother.

208
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,864
Maribu-kun.

209
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,399
Here.

210
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,981
And the older brother
began to bully his little brother...

211
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,116
because he was envious
of him.

212
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:22,422
He played the part of the kind older
brother in front of their mother...

213
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,658
but behind her back,

214
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,929
he bullied Maribu.
She didn't notice it.

215
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,630
This so-called
"Tama Beauty."

216
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,433
It seems she pretended not
to see what she saw.

217
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,035
"It seems"?

218
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,970
What were you doing, then?
You're the father you know.

219
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,439
Masanobu had...

220
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,677
started law school at the
public university...

221
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:49,483
And Maribu was getting
his own life started...

222
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,818
Um... My...

223
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,921
How do I say it...

224
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:59,726
My adultery got found out...

225
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,228
What are you thinking?

226
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,867
Tama Beauty went
crazy with rage.

227
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,302
She had a lot of
pride to begin with.

228
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,939
She always condemned my
character after that.

229
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,841
You reaped what you'd sowed.

230
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,517
- You know, Yamaji-san...
- Yeah?

231
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,218
I...

232
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:29,022
"you reaped what you've
sowed" is...

233
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:34,061
of all the many phrases, the one
I hate the most.

234
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,596
- Sorry.
- The most, without question.

235
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,265
2nd is: "legal compensation,"
3rd is: "alimony."

236
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,435
- But the fact is...
- I reaped what I'd sowed.

237
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,839
I admit that, of course I do.

238
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,975
I'll live the rest of my life
reaping what I've sowed.

239
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,510
So don't remind me.

240
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,646
You know, don't mention it.

241
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,016
Don't mention it on the side.
Give it to me as a big conclusion.

242
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,284
A big conclusion.

243
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,785
Or...

244
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,155
tell me after I'm dead.

245
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,757
Because I know...

246
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,693
my death won't be dignified any way.

247
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,963
You laughed, didn't you?

248
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:15,902
After the divorce Masanobu became
estranged to me.

249
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,238
He had no obligation
to live with me,

250
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,274
so he left home and pursued
to become a lawyer.

251
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:27,814
Maribu was touted as a prodigy, but
at that time, his grades plummeted.

252
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:33,086
That was because the diffused
attention he had been receiving

253
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,822
from his mom suddenly
honed in on him and him alone.

254
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:43,029
"I didn't marry to put a stranger's
child through college."

255
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,032
"Your turn has finally come."

256
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,536
"You must boldly aim for the top."

257
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,571
"What do you think you're doing?"

258
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,274
"I can't take this anymore."

259
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,811
"If you don't win. My life..."

260
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,646
"can be considered a huge failure!"

261
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,284
Number 127, you have a visitor.

262
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,029
I was assigned the case
by Michigami Iwao.

263
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,632
I am Michigami of Law Office
of Michigami.

264
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,634
You are Michigami Maribu?

265
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,003
That's right.

266
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,441
Have you submitted to
questionings cooperatively?

267
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,616
Regarding how we
will proceed,

268
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,718
do you require a
consultation?

269
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,690
I'm going to trial.

270
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,428
But I don't want a lawyer.
It's a waste of money.

271
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:51,865
And I wouldn't want
you as my defender.

272
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,136
I'll bow out myself,
you jerk!

273
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,005
Now you're talking,
bastard!

274
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,007
What's going on here?

275
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,243
Who do you think
you are, bastard?

276
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,379
What's the prodigy doing in here?

277
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,381
Look how you've fallen!

278
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,221
Oh no...

279
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,991
It's partly your fault!

280
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,067
Shut up, you're
an embarassment!

281
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,401
I hope you get convicted!

282
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,739
Okay, that's enough now.
Enough. Please stop, you two.

283
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,608
Please stop!

284
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,612
Please stop! What's
happening here?

285
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,380
What's going on?
What are you doing?

286
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,683
No can do,
out of the question.

287
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,786
I'm turning it down.

288
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,489
Please reconsider, so he
may return to society.

289
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,858
Impossible.
He's not legit.

290
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,297
He tricked your sister into working
at his pub, didn't he?

291
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,032
He's scum.

292
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,102
What does "legit" mean?

293
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,904
- Huh?
- Who decides what's "legit"?

294
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,106
Who is the standard
of measure?

295
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,907
Society and the law.

296
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,010
In that case he must be scum.

297
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:14,214
But he's always been legit.
Ever since I've met him.

298
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,783
What's your connection to him?

299
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,485
I'm a victim of his extortion.

300
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,020
He took 120,000 yen from me.

301
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:22,689
You a twerp or something?

302
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,024
Oh!

303
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,426
What's your problem?

304
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,094
I'm gonna bash you up.

305
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,931
I told him I'll erase his tab if he
came to my shop 100 times.

306
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,734
Then he really came.
A full 100 times.

307
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,070
He sure did, come to think of it.

308
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,605
Maribu-kun
always made sense.

309
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,440
It's amazing.

310
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,110
It's amazing.

311
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,046
He attended a university that
would have him,

312
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,482
he works at a company that would
have him, and hasn't quit.

313
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:53,520
It's like repeating the same stage
in a game without leveling up.

314
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,588
Even though you could
easily clear the stage.

315
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,856
Also...

316
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,259
the chest thing.

317
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,730
So in other words,
isn't it about chest?

318
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,301
But he was praising Sakama-kun
the other day.

319
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:12,138
He bumps into many things,
breaks dishes...

320
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:16,710
gets scolded by a part-time worker,
washes sauce and salt in the sink.

321
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,712
Nobody's like that.

322
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,347
He's not cut out for it.

323
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,016
That doesn't sound
like praise at all.

324
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,985
But he said you're a fighter.

325
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,521
He said you're awesome.

326
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,058
He said he needed to get himself
together too; and became a gardener.

327
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,128
He's not legit at all.

328
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,630
That's because society
is not legit.

329
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,934
That's why he, who is legit, gets
treated like a freak.

330
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,638
Sorry, that was arrogant.

331
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,445
Anyway, now,

332
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,849
the only person who can save
Maribu-kun is you.

333
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,052
Please.

334
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,420
Please.

335
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,225
Where's my father during all this?

336
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,926
He's a victim.

337
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,064
Victim, huh? Even when the real
victims are being so kind.

338
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,565
Um...

339
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,335
he's here.

340
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,039
The vibes at work are already

341
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,842
deeply set; they're bad vibes.

342
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,811
And at work,...

343
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,181
I want to get out of that "power-
harassed" image, and yet...

344
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,517
I haven't found a new image yet!

345
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,393
You know...

346
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,632
this image thing...

347
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,635
do you really need to choose one?

348
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,839
If you just be yourself...

349
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,208
isn't it already wonderful enough?

350
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,878
He does make a good
listener at least...

351
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,680
But as a father, well...

352
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,155
Okay.

353
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,260
You should hire movers
to help you move.

354
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,263
That won't be romantic for
newlyweds.

355
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,999
Midori-san rode in the truck
here too, you know.

356
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,635
She had loaded a white dresser,
like a young girl's.

357
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,405
I'm throwing that dresser
away now.

358
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,640
I'm not a little girl anymore.

359
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,211
- I'm home, give me a hand.
- Here he comes.

360
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,612
No, no, no...

361
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,047
you stay seated.

362
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,982
Gosh it's hot.
I want cold barley tea.

363
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,218
I cleared out upstairs.
Use it any way you like.

364
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,053
Thank you very much.

365
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:43,923
Mother.

366
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,127
I look forward to
living with you.

367
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:51,564
Oh my, how formal...

368
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,666
same here as well...

369
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,236
I'm looking forward to it.

370
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,373
Okay, let's carry the stuff out,
Masakazu.

371
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,708
Let's take a break!

372
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,810
No, it's a lot in the truck.

373
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,346
She's industrious, isn't she?

374
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,882
A call for you,
Yamaji-sensei.

375
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,216
Oh, okay.

376
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,156
Hello, this is Yamaji speaking.

377
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,625
It's Shizuma.

378
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,929
Is there a teacher called
Maruyama where you work?

379
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,899
Yes, he's two desks away from mine.

380
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,736
"What is going on?"

381
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,771
Oh my...

382
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,640
What happened?

383
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,776
Nothing.

384
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,045
So that's how it is...

385
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,714
my battle with you is
now on hiatus.

386
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,550
I'm not battling
in the first place.

387
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,817
You shaking salt to your enemy?

388
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,654
It's "sending salt," not
"shaking."

389
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,225
But really...

390
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,934
He asked for my phone number.

391
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,235
Who did?

392
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,171
What am I going to do?

393
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,947
I need to apologize to you about
something, sensei.

394
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,048
Huh?

395
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,983
It's about my career path.

396
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,052
Oh...

397
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,755
I decided...

398
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,059
to become a teacher afterall.

399
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,293
What?

400
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,895
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,698
I know I said
I was burned out, but...

402
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,833
I always think about...

403
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,070
the view from the
teaching platform;

404
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,273
the faculty room;
I wonder why?

405
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,343
Maybe I left something behind...

406
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,545
in the 4th grade, class-2 classroom.

407
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,415
Precious memories with
a precious person.

408
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,250
Are you okay?

409
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,219
Hey you! Hey!

410
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,821
Oh, I'm fine.

411
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,156
Sorry to bother you,
I have to go now.

412
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,560
So I'm going to get a
teaching license,

413
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,128
and take the hiring test...

414
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,230
Good job.

415
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,633
Maruyama-sensei,
got a minute?

416
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,334
What the...

417
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,437
That's not me.
That's me.

418
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,607
What's your relationship?

419
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,876
With Ecchan?

420
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,311
Yeah.

421
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,348
We normally play online games...

422
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:27,587
we sometimes have tea together,
go to karaoke while we talk....

423
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:35,428
I know your charade. You act all
cute at first as you approach her...

424
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:40,800
and you nonchalantly touch her; I,
won't allow it, fashionable virgin.

425
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,569
- Wait a second.
- I want to laugh it off,

426
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,571
but I can't and I had to live
with it till today.

427
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,475
My libido and I are in
daily conflict!

428
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,376
What's going on?

429
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,648
I'm a virgin, you're a virgin, but
we're fundamentally different.

430
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,583
Wait a second!

431
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:01,654
You're assuming that
I'm a virgin, but...

432
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,290
I'm not a virgin.

433
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:08,461
I've known women, in spite of
how I look.

434
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,231
I lost my virginity when I was 16.

435
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:16,335
It was with a girl who
was my senior.

436
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,571
I apologize.

437
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,073
Apology my foot.

438
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,208
I'm sorry.

439
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,209
You're a couple of fools.

440
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,377
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,718
Sakama-san and Yamaji-san
requested me to be here...

442
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:33,820
Sit down.

443
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,561
Aren't you settling this out
of court, professor?

444
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,029
What did you...

445
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,665
do to the gardener called
Kitazawa?

446
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,567
Stop it!

447
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,801
Kitazawa-san...

448
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,503
is pressing charges for assault.

449
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,140
You're in double jeopardy.

450
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,476
He rejected
out-of-court settlement.

451
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,378
I'm going to have to fight so you
don't get prosecuted.

452
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:02,381
Who's paying?

453
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,852
It better not be
Sakama and Yama-chan.

454
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,254
I can't take money from your
victims, you idiot.

455
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,290
I'm home.

456
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,059
Welcome home.

457
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,227
Welcome home.

458
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,763
A delivery of Saga-bred steaks came

459
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,332
from my father back home.

460
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,100
What? Oh my!

461
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,237
This is amazing.

462
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,839
This is Yutori.

463
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,809
I saw the news about you.

464
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,210
I know that I'm

465
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,480
in no position to say anything
that could comfort you, but...

466
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,581
I'm writing anyway,

467
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,050
about home,

468
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,652
and recent events.

469
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,222
A new bride has joined the
Sakama family.

470
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,224
It's Akane-san.

471
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,227
She's very fun.

472
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,129
She's radiant like the sun.

473
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,932
She has brought light
into our home.

474
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,600
My bro is working hard too.

475
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,003
My little brother
Masakazu here

476
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,672
will officially be working here, on
occasion of his marriage.

477
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,707
You all know who I am.

478
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,678
I'll draw from my experience
as an office worker,

479
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,947
and mainly support my brother
in business management.

480
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,816
Looking forward to
working with you.

481
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,051
The wedding is planned
for October,

482
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,086
to be held at a Shinto shrine.

483
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,022
I never thought it'd happen, but

484
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,223
Miyashita-kun is retiring.

485
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:18,524
She's getting married.

486
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,393
Let's congratulate him even
if we don't mean it.

487
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,595
Congratulations.

488
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,430
Thank you very much.

489
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:27,233
Thanks. Thanks.

490
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,801
This is Aoyama-kun.

491
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,671
She's taking over your Sendai-
branch project job

492
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,206
soon as you leave.

493
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,274
I've always looked up to you,
Miyashita-senpai; it's an

494
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,709
honor to work in your post.

495
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:37,944
I will do my best.

496
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,979
Oh, sure, knock yourself out.

497
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,515
Sure will.

498
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,983
Oh yeah...

499
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,219
the blueprint arrived...

500
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,025
This is where the elevator
got placed...

501
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,628
Which means the position
of the branch would be...

502
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,179
- What are you doing?
- You scared me.

503
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,314
What? What do you want?

504
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,919
Yutori.

505
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,054
Let's wrestle.

506
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,156
I'm not wrestling.

507
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,361
Come on, let's play.

508
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,631
I'm bored.

509
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,068
- Ding!
- Not "ding."

510
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,503
Come here, come here.

511
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,138
Come on.

512
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,641
Okay.

513
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,544
If any of this fits you,
you want it?

514
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,146
- You sure?
- Yeah. I don't need them.

515
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,016
But they're brand new.
The tags are still on!

516
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,418
The shoes might not fit...

517
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,420
What's your shoe size?

518
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,024
- Akane-san...
- Hm?

519
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,092
You cried in your interview,
didn't you?

520
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,695
- What?
- My bro told me.

521
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:05,064
I didn't cry.

522
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,167
Masakazu cried during
employee training, though.

523
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,302
He did?

524
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,903
They were split into pairs.

525
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,572
The partners would pinpoint each
others' weaknesses.

526
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,207
It was a self-improvement thing,
at 6:00 A.M. no less.

527
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,610
He must've been hungry
and irritable.

528
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,778
So I told him:

529
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,346
"You're not as cool
as you think."

530
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,214
"Nor are you smart."

531
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:24,250
"You're a dufus. So you
must improve yourself;"

532
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,651
"otherwise you won't succeed."

533
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,055
Then Masakazu started to cry
while eating breakfast.

534
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,290
You made him cry, Akane-san?

535
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,896
Who knew I'd marry him?

536
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,834
I worked 7.5 years in the office.

537
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,941
It was fun though.
No regrets.

538
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,511
-You're working at a travel agency?
-Yes.

539
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,814
I bet the employee training
will be tough.

540
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,750
But it also looks fun. You can go
to all kinds of places.

541
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,719
Oh, yeah.

542
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,321
You should plan a wine
distillery tour.

543
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,456
Make it super cheap.

544
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,758
With hot springs to boot.
What do you say?

545
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,793
Let's submit the idea!

546
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,230
Oh well.

547
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,137
I'm taking a bath.

548
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,877
Come to think of it,

549
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,712
I've never told you

550
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,547
about the origin of my name.

551
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,851
It actually has nothing to do
with the

552
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,586
millennial generation
(yutori).

553
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:40,559
Which-will-I-choose?

554
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,629
When I was still in my
mother's womb,

555
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:44,964
my two older brothers

556
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,899
were thinking about
what to name

557
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,567
their new baby sibling.

558
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,474
"Yutori...

559
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,511
... of God."

560
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,580
"Yutori of God"? What
does that mean?

561
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,383
Mom.

562
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,919
Masakazu said,

563
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,055
the name will be
"Yutori of God."

564
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,222
And that is how...

565
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,924
I became "Yutori."

566
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,026
Is that true?

567
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,263
That's why I'm eternally
thankful to my big brother.

568
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,633
Because if we left it up to God...

569
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,234
I would have been called "Kaba"

570
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,270
or "Baka" instead.

571
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,976
Cut the crap.

572
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,879
Why does she need a passport
to make the birth report?

573
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,082
Maribu, I have it.

574
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,084
You talk about rules.

575
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,920
You'd actually deport a
mother with a newborn baby?

576
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,022
And you call yourself
a Japanese?

577
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,191
My passport isn't fake.

578
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,525
It's real.

579
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,061
It is?

580
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,896
In that case you should've...

581
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,999
shown it right away, dummy.

582
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,673
Children can't choose
their parents.

583
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,341
They can't choose their
names either.

584
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,710
That's why we just have to
believing in...

585
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:08,214
our parents who had
given us life...

586
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,716
and given us our names.

587
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,386
The same is true of
millennials.

588
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:18,290
They're the grownups who
gave us life and our names.

589
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,459
So they should take
proper care of us.

590
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,728
Isn't that so?

591
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,500
And soon, it'll be our turn
to shape society.

592
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,069
It'll be our turn to give life
and give names.

593
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,838
Isn't that so?

594
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,611
What the heck...

595
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:43,482
She's grown up before me.

596
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,584
You're released on bail,
number 127.

597
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,154
What? What?
I'm not getting indicted?

598
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,223
Maribu.

599
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,063
It wasn't me.

600
00:29:58,197 --> 00:29:59,932
Your mother paid the bail.

601
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,433
The case wasn't dropped

602
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,968
due to my inability.

603
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,737
Where is the
immigration bureau?

604
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,306
The report of birth has
been submitted?

605
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,707
At that point she should
have applied

606
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,009
for a staying visa.

607
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,877
She would've received
special permission to stay...

608
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:15,181
I don't get this whole "special
permission to stay" thing.

609
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,082
When an illegal immigrant

610
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,351
gives birth to a Japanese
child and is raising it,

611
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,587
she could receive a special
permit to stay.

612
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,289
That is, if she had applied
for the permission.

613
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,124
In other words...

614
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,526
she doesn't need to keep
running from the law?

615
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,029
I never heard of such a system.

616
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,232
Nobody taught me that in school
and prep-school.

617
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,802
- Can you contact her?
- I can't.

618
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,071
She doesn't have a cell phone.

619
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,208
I tried buying her one, but
she couldn't get a contract.

620
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,210
They wanted to see her
stay visa.

621
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,811
Or her passport,
and all that.

622
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,546
Stop it, Maribu.

623
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,814
You're out on bail.

624
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:49,848
Anyway...

625
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,484
all we can do is put out a police
search, or wait till she shows up.

626
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,386
She's not going to show up!

627
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,888
You idiot!

628
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,223
She's on the run!

629
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,625
Maribu, stop that.

630
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,427
Listen to me.

631
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,395
You were at fault too, you know?

632
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,897
You reaped what you sow...

633
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:08,834
Sorry.

634
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,979
What did you apologize for?

635
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,722
What did you apologize for?

636
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,559
Because I don't have the
right to speak to you that way.

637
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,427
I no longer

638
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,363
count, you see.

639
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,566
Then who else would
speak to me like that?

640
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,601
To me?

641
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,272
You're the only one I've got.

642
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:51,143
Get your act together,
old man.

643
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,612
Stop that.

644
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,381
It's a civil matter.

645
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,557
Don't give me a
cheap apology.

646
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,594
You can't apologize and get away
with what you have done.

647
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,231
I would've changed you if
you were on rental.

648
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:15,467
But I can't change you,
so it's maddening!

649
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:18,070
Because you're the
only one I've got.

650
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,606
You're my father, so speak
to me like a father.

651
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,475
It's your personal issues
that don't count!

652
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,544
You're my father, so act like it.

653
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,280
Because I didn't get choose.

654
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,182
I had no choice!

655
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,019
Yes.

656
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,589
Not "yes." Say it.
Who's at fault here?

657
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,631
It's your fault!

658
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,400
You reaped what you've sowed!

659
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,541
Dad...

660
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:07,720
You got no right to speak to
me like that, you jerk!

661
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,222
Hey...

662
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:13,225
Then...

663
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,061
what am I supposed to do, huh?

664
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,766
Is this how you behave
toward your father?

665
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:27,306
- Help! Somebody help!
- It's a civil matter.

666
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,346
You fool! Fool!

667
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,648
"Due to a party reservation, we will
open at 19:00 today."

668
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:39,218
What's this party reservation thing?

669
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,254
Oh...

670
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,724
you don't want to go in looking
like that anyway, do you?

671
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,227
I'll go home first.

672
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,862
You can eat yakitori anywhere,
you know.

673
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:51,563
No, it has to be here.

674
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,932
I promised myself to eat yakitori
here after I got out.

675
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,467
Maribu-kun.

676
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,504
Maribu-kun.

677
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,013
Well. Thanks for your hard work.

678
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,515
Sit, sit.

679
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,986
Store manager, today I'll...

680
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,854
Don't worry about it, it's to
celebrate his release.

681
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,623
Is beer okay for you?

682
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,192
You've done all this...

683
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,427
for my son...

684
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,095
It's not for him.

685
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,798
It's for me and him.

686
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,233
Oh, of course!

687
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,570
Since he's out on bail,
the trial comes next?

688
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:35,140
Yes. But it's promising since
this was his first offense.

689
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,176
I'm glad.

690
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,111
I was scared of asking
the big brother here...

691
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,313
that maybe it might backfire.

692
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,881
But I'm a professional.

693
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,316
In the realm of the law, that is.

694
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,717
So he says, but you know...

695
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,352
he was visiting every day...

696
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,321
Shut up already.

697
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,523
You're distracting Sakama.

698
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,893
Don't look at me so much.

699
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,696
But this is the last time we'll
see you work here.

700
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,438
The salt didn't sprinkle on it.

701
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,540
Most of it fell to the floor.

702
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:11,810
What a shame he's quitting; he
had gotten so skilled.

703
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,812
Maybe you can work
here part time.

704
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:14,780
He's got time, right?

705
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,249
He's got time because it's not
busy right now, that's all.

706
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,718
Wine making gets busy
starting Autumn.

707
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,430
Here you go.

708
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,000
Here.

709
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,002
Thank you for waiting.

710
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,304
Thank you.

711
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,174
Tab.

712
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,377
The beer just came.

713
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,546
I shouldn't stay long.
See ya.

714
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,559
Thank you very much.

715
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,468
Listen, senpai...

716
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,205
are you really quitting?

717
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,143
I'm quitting. Why?

718
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,277
Well...

719
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,846
I need a good reason.

720
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,416
It's too vague, I dunno.

721
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,217
You should talk.

722
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,519
That's right.

723
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,388
"kneel down to me" you said
and raised all that fuss.

724
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,724
I can speak my mind too.

725
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,026
If he quits now...

726
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,096
then senpai will just be a
millennial after all.

727
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,332
Some people are
already saying that.

728
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,833
I've gotten my satisfaction.

729
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,135
For 7.5 years...

730
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,706
though I'm just a small fry,
I did the best I could.

731
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,808
I had a taste of hell now and
then too.

732
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,610
I had precious experiences.

733
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,479
I met the best partner ever.

734
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,218
So I've gotten my satisfaction.

735
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,220
From now on, with my wife,

736
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,023
and my big brother,
who's a smaller fry than me,

737
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,758
I'm going to run the small company

738
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,226
to make sure it doesn't
get any smaller.

739
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,195
That's how I'll live out my days.

740
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,130
I don't get it.

741
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,431
Okay.

742
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:50,068
Since you can't report me for
power harassment...

743
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:53,071
I'm going to say what I want to
say, once and for all.

744
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,040
Yamagishi.

745
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,708
Yes.

746
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,110
You...

747
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,312
are not as...

748
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,181
cool as you think, nor smart as you
think; you're a dufus.

749
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,183
Stop being such a flake.

750
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,853
Make an effort to
improve on yourself.

751
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,223
Or else you'll never succeed.

752
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,026
Masakazu...

753
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:16,762
That's all.

754
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,607
Oh!

755
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,275
He's crying.

756
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,512
Yamagishi is crying.

757
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:38,216
Sir. Would that be considered
power harassment?

758
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:44,022
"Three months later"
- Of Sakama Wine Distillery,

759
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,958
Sakama Munetaka...

760
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,361
Sakama Masakazu...

761
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,096
will hereby

762
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,432
as sacred distillers,

763
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,100
will with radiant, pure,

764
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,235
sincere hearts...

765
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,571
Wait up!

766
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,607
You're fast!

767
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,209
Yamaji!

768
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,712
Okay, Yamaji is here!

769
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,313
What's all the commotion?

770
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:09,481
Mori-kun and Muto-kun

771
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,717
sexually harassed Nomura-san.

772
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,352
Se-, se-, sexual harassment?

773
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,154
He said, "say what

774
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,422
size cup is your bra."

775
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:20,625
No-Nomura-san. You wear a bra?

776
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,629
Yamaji made her cry!

777
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,167
What were you thinking?

778
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,969
It's not too soon for a
4th grader to wear

779
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,070
a bra in 2nd semester.

780
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,772
I'm sorry.

781
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,007
Some will begin menstruation.

782
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,976
You must be extra sensitive.

783
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,211
Letter.

784
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,213
You better assign the
dates.

785
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,548
Otherwise Yamaji-sensei won't
be able to get serious.

786
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,384
No, no, don't bother.

787
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:48,186
So, the health and physical
fitness class of 4th grade is...

788
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,255
But Yamaji-sensei is still a...

789
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,223
Virgin.

790
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,958
It'll be during the 4th hour,
on Friday.

791
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,093
So, that'll be set for...

792
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,928
October 14.

793
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:57,963
Okay.

794
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:06,671
"To Mr. Yamaji Kazutoyo"

795
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,874
"To Mr. Yamaji Kazutoyo"

796
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:12,844
Sorry about that.

797
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,813
I didn't know your address,

798
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:15,714
so I sent it to school.

799
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,182
It'll be on October...

800
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,017
the 15th, is that so?

801
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,520
Right; it's an auspicious day
plus a day off.

802
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,190
Can you come?

803
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,759
- I'm going.
- As the emcee too?

804
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,561
The emcee? Me?

805
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,129
Didn't Akane-chan tell you?

806
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,864
She never did.
But why me?

807
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,332
Why? Well...

808
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,401
I can't ask Aso-san.

809
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,436
Yeah, but...

810
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,609
These are going to be tough
consecutive events...

811
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,378
But I must say,
you haven't changed.

812
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,480
- Same old Yama-chan.
- You think so?

813
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:52,184
But Sakama-kun, you
have somewhat...

814
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,220
become wild.

815
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,589
You were searching for a nice
word, weren't you?

816
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,124
Oh yeah.

817
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:01,293
This is from Akane-chan.

818
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,195
Oh, thanks.

819
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:04,629
Masakazu.

820
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,833
What's the order and inventory
status of the micro-brew beer?

821
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,002
I think my brother was in
charge of that.

822
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,137
Okay.

823
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,405
No, you were.

824
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,340
I'm too busy with the
new wine distillation.

825
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,776
Who's in charge?

826
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,678
But I have to go make
my rounds.

827
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,480
I have the new wine...

828
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,514
But I...

829
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,649
It doesn't matter who's
in charge.

830
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:27,018
Just make a decision. Now.

831
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,154
Can you run a business without

832
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,756
checking the inventory? What if
we run out of stock?

833
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,027
Then...

834
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,231
I'll be in charge.

835
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,566
And Sakama-san.

836
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,500
Yes?

837
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,804
- "Yes"?
- "Sakama-san"?

838
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,772
- What?
- Yes?

839
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,274
That's from...

840
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,609
being an area manager.

841
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,811
That's right. She's a stay-at-home
area manager.

842
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:53,845
How's Maribu-kun?

843
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,214
Haven't seen him. He hasn't
replied to my letters either.

844
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,682
Hmm...

845
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,885
How did the trial go?

846
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,553
I couldn't attend
because of work.

847
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,321
Shall we go see him?

848
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:06,124
I think he still lives in the
same apartment.

849
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,393
No, not today.

850
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,962
I have to go get an order.

851
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:12,230
Or else my better half...

852
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,232
will gripe at me.

853
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,401
Better half, eh?

854
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:17,936
You again?

855
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,271
We're not buying.

856
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,472
I brought you bottles of

857
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:21,806
"Tears of the Demon Bride."

858
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,208
I don't want it.

859
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,142
Welcome.

860
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,210
No, no.

861
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,046
Then can you buy our T-shirts?

862
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,381
We made some.

863
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,052
We don't even want your wine.

864
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,353
Why would we want
your T-shirts?

865
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,055
Get out!

866
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:39,925
Here, let me help you.

867
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,192
Get out.

868
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:42,627
Get out.

869
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:43,895
"Searching"
- She's a Chinese lady

870
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,064
with baby. I'm searching for her.
Thank you very much.

871
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,599
Please contact me
if you see them.

872
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,267
Please help.

873
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,235
Please help.

874
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,103
She's a Chinese lady...

875
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,305
Thank you very much.

876
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:55,173
- She's a Chinese lady...
- Please help.

877
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,641
- She's a Chinese lady...
- Please help.

878
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:58,109
I'm looking for my baby.

879
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,718
You scared me.

880
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,090
My brother used to sit
there to drink.

881
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,228
I was looking at Facebook.

882
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,066
Whose?

883
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,435
Nobody in particular.

884
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:24,970
Just wondering how
everybody's doing.

885
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:30,642
Yamagishi's posts are nothing but
lies, as usual.

886
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,017
We're getting married, aren't we?

887
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,020
We are. Why?

888
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,056
It just doesn't feel real.

889
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,527
You don't want to marry?

890
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,030
I want to. I do, but...

891
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:53,999
then again...

892
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,401
I felt if I did, I might
become empty.

893
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,337
The moment I feel happiness...

894
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,972
it might end right there.

895
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,542
You won't become empty,
Akane-chan.

896
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:05,643
You think so?

897
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,012
That's right.

898
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,713
When you become happy...

899
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:11,316
you will try to become even
happier; that's how you are.

900
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,917
Because you're greedy.

901
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,187
That's why I want to marry you.

902
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:17,889
Thanks.

903
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,257
I'm sorry.

904
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,359
All I ever thought for

905
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,194
7.5 years is work.

906
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,631
I've never known any other
sense of fulfillment.

907
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,003
In that case...

908
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,140
think of it as work.

909
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,044
To become happy.

910
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:40,879
That is your job.

911
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,581
You can think of it like that.

912
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,461
I am so happy right now.

913
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,764
I'm happy too.

914
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,141
Yikes!

915
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,682
I'm sorry.

916
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:20,652
What?

917
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,356
What's the matter,
Akane-chan?

918
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,127
What're you doing,
Akane-chan?

919
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,929
Punch me, then.

920
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:31,963
Seriously?

921
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,498
Making excuses,
crying...

922
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:34,833
blaming others...

923
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,001
grownups make
mistakes too.

924
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,270
Sorry. I can't go in the
presence of God like this.

925
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,072
- Masakazu!
- I can't do it right now!

926
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,474
Masakazu!
