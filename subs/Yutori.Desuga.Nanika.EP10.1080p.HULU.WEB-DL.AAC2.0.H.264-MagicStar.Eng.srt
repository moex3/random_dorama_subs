1
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:06,173
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,145
Sorry.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,281
Huh?

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,020
What's the matter, Akane-chan?

5
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,194
We've never had
drama between us.

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,029
We started work at the same time,

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,634
and 7.5 years dragged on as we
got closer, then further, and so on.

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,036
What?

9
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,807
I think couples like that may
surprisingly not tie the knot.

10
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,146
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,648
What's wrong? This isn't
like you, Akane-chan.

12
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,316
You're always so decisive.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,787
And how about you, how can you
be so sure of yourself?

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,655
I'm not, really...

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,860
It's not like at work; I can't make
a firm decision on personal matters.

16
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:04,698
We don't have income, you know?
I was prepared for that, but...

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,637
In this family business we must sell
a bottle at a time, or we'll starve.

18
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,672
That's why it's fun.

19
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,974
Results are direct, unlike
big businesses.

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,143
They reflect our abilities, as well
as our responsibilities.

21
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,846
There are no guarantees, but
it's well worth the effort.

22
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,217
For you only?

23
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,659
Akane-chan.

24
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,862
You want to go back
to work, don't you?

25
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,534
Then you should get
a job at Min Min.

26
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,736
That'll help us out too.

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,972
I know you can get rehired.
Or I can ask Hayakawa-san...

28
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,440
You can't do that.

29
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,012
You can't. Besides, I
wouldn't want to do that.

30
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,448
I can't.

31
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,233
Did something happen?

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,635
With Hayakawa-san?

33
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,471
You have good intuition at
the wrong time.

34
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,074
I knew something was weird.

35
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,445
He's not coming to the wedding.

36
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,349
Hayakawasa-san was nonchalant
when you quit too.

37
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,885
Hold on. I'll tell you.

38
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,353
I know why he didn't try
to change my mind...

39
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,689
but now I know why he didn't try to
change your mind about quitting.

40
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,491
Just be quiet and listen.

41
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,504
It was as you think.

42
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,943
Excuse me, a glass of water.

43
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,648
I see.

44
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,860
So that's how it was.

45
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,645
What?

46
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,015
Masakazu, it's late, you'll
wake everybody up.

47
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,652
No! No way!

48
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,026
No! No! No!

49
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,632
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:56,303
I'm not apologizing about
what I did...

51
00:03:56,437 --> 00:04:00,908
well, of course I am, but the
timing for it is off...

52
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,309
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,912
Not at all.

54
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,015
I'm not mad.

55
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,284
Not completely not-mad, but...

56
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,021
It happened only once, right?
And you were drunk, right?

57
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:18,092
It was the part of our rocky
relationship when we were separated.

58
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,694
So you didn't belong
to anybody at that time.

59
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:21,595
"Belong"?

60
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,031
Not "belong," I know you're not
a possession. Sorry about that.

61
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,103
But it was only one time, right?
I didn't do anything, though.

62
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,806
I could have, that would've been
fine, but I didn't do anything!

63
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,022
Are you thinking?

64
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,492
Thinking?

65
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,029
Me?

66
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,231
About what?

67
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,005
About the kind of attitude you
must take as a man.

68
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,643
I don't have that ability.

69
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,048
I mean, really.
What is this?

70
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,216
What were you thinking?

71
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:23,223
Why have you kept quiet
about it till now?

72
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,869
Akane-chan, what happened?

73
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,105
Nothing. Nothing at all.

74
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,108
I heard sirens or something.
Is there a fire?

75
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,844
Masakazu?

76
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,013
Hey, Masakazu.

77
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,949
Hayakawa-kawa-kawa!

78
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,851
Damn you!

79
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,020
"Hayakawa"? Who's that?

80
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,688
A mystery?

81
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,401
Hey, how dare you show your face
around here!

82
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,702
Huh?

83
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,504
Hey, Maribu!

84
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,307
I'm taking a break.

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,508
Get me coffee.

86
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,676
Yes.

87
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,953
Even ex-convicts need to eat.

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,688
Yeah, but...

89
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,657
I'm his boss.

90
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,027
Go work elsewhere if
you don't like it.

91
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,931
It's work. Work.

92
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,068
I'll be on a business trip
that day. Sorry.

93
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,469
Is that so?

94
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,072
Since you were our direct superior,
Hayakawa-san,

95
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,341
we wanted you to give a speech
at a our wedding.

96
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,408
Everything okay?

97
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,476
My wife?

98
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,078
No, you.

99
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,347
"My wife" sounds odd.

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,849
She's been wanting to
come back to work.

101
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,520
Even while anticipating
the prospect of homemaking,

102
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,256
she seems to be rejecting it.

103
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,025
I see...

104
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,694
So that's what you wanted
to talk about.

105
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,097
Can you lend us your help,
Hayakawa-san,

106
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,099
so that she can get re-hired?

107
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,968
She's so competent...

108
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,338
she could get hired anywhere.
It doesn't have to be us.

109
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:23,010
I could introduce her somewhere
as an intermediary...

110
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,780
Is that because there is some
shady issue involved?

111
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,183
Shady?

112
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,318
Ouch!

113
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,320
Me?

114
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,056
That's ridiculous.

115
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,662
Is that what she said?

116
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,531
Either way, that's insulting.

117
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:51,805
Sorry, grandma is in town,
I can't make it today.

118
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,574
No, that's not it...

119
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,741
Did you pay?

120
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,109
I paid. 9,000 yen.

121
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,112
It was an upfront payment.
I didn't know that.

122
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,448
No, no, this isn't good.

123
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,520
Because you said, sensei,

124
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,754
it's where we can be alone.

125
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:12,192
No, I meant a place where
there are no people.

126
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,696
In terms of a general meaning,
sure, but, I, you see...

127
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,397
I have to say...

128
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:22,135
the name of the parts
out loud, so...

129
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,670
That's...

130
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,776
Mother?

131
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,213
I'm not your "mother."

132
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,283
Yamaji-kun.

133
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,492
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:50,030
I guess apologizing
isn't right either.

135
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,035
I suddenly see the faces of
the kids in class...

136
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,007
I can't do this.

137
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,443
I imagine them asking me
questions in my head.

138
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,651
From Mori-kun, Kato-kun,
Inoue-san; it sounds like an excuse,

139
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,656
but I hear...

140
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,360
"Yamaji. How are babies made?"

141
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,031
They ask me innocently.

142
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,838
You're a good teacher.

143
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,840
Huh?

144
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,342
Um...

145
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,011
what just happened...

146
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,014
About what I had said...

147
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,216
You don't have to become
a good teacher.

148
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,185
Become a good human being.

149
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:50,023
Was what you said an
"answer song" kind of rebuke?

150
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,359
In other words,
you're saying that I'm

151
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,729
not a good human being?

152
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,032
When is your class?

153
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,402
Oh, the health class?
At the end of the week.

154
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,007
I wish you all the best.

155
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,814
Ouch!

156
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,850
Excuse me.

157
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,686
Hey, Yamaji.

158
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,221
Akane-chan.

159
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,390
What are you saying? What are
you doing, Akane-chan?

160
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,025
Truly...

161
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:29,529
I can say anything to you. So I
should've confessed it to you.

162
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,366
Well, instead of the main
person in concern...

163
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,867
But still...

164
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
it was only once, right?

165
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,006
Here we go.
You too, Yama?

166
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,908
Why do men obsess over the
number of times?

167
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:47,347
Would "one time" be okay? No.
Once is once. It's not zero.

168
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,283
If once is okay, what if it was once
with a hundred different men?

169
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,184
Excuse me.

170
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,620
Excuse you is right.

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,224
It's not a light burden.

172
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,827
The weight of the burden...

173
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,097
even to me, is quite intense.

174
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:10,837
I had thought I could handle
work and love at the same time.

175
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,807
But I ruined everything
at the very end.

176
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,943
What have I done?

177
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,345
I'm an idiot.

178
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:22,649
I don't deserve to be happy.
I want to die.

179
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,385
I should be judged in hell.

180
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,187
Akane-chan. Akane-chan.

181
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,257
"We will, we will..."

182
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,193
not "rock you," Akane-chan.

183
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,296
Are you acting this way on purpose,

184
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,098
so I could tell Sakama-kun
that you're down in the dumps?

185
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,633
Because if you are...

186
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,271
you're doing the wrong thing.
You have to tell him yourself.

187
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,841
Then punch me.

188
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,343
Punch me in Masakazu's
stead.

189
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,912
Huh?

190
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,814
Because if he were to punch me...

191
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,649
I'd be so sad I'd die.

192
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:59,152
- Get out, what'd you take me for?
- A friend.

193
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,353
Oh, yeah. That's true.

194
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,557
Unless I get hurt too,
we can't strike a balance.

195
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,760
I don't want Masakazu to
suffer anymore.

196
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,528
So I thought about it.

197
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:12,632
How I could get hurt,
without him having to get hurt.

198
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,002
I've been thinking for a while...

199
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,906
Ouch... What was that for?

200
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,242
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Was that too soon?

201
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,846
That was too soon. The gong
hadn't gone off yet.

202
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:30,217
But I got a deep understanding
of your sentiment.

203
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,519
I don't know anymore...

204
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,355
I don't want any more of this.

205
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,923
Are you all right?

206
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,694
I saw that.

207
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,028
That was inexcusable.
That was disgusting!

208
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,063
No, no, no...

209
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,132
What? What's going on?

210
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,034
Oh crap. Did you assault her?

211
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,637
Ice! Bring ice!

212
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,440
- Call the police first.
- No, you got it all wrong.

213
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,407
What's wrong with you?

214
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,576
The wedding is day
after tomorrow!

215
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,111
Oh man...

216
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,013
How could you?

217
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:29,676
We're Millennials.
Got a Problem?

218
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,680
It's no good.

219
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,317
I think I'm a no-good human being.

220
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,719
Come on, relax.

221
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,922
Even if she asked me to...

222
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,257
even still...

223
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,028
how could I hit a woman?

224
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:56,036
This virgin domestic-violence
bastard is going to teach sex-ed?

225
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,971
That's totally crazy.

226
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,839
Aren't knowledge and experience
are irrelevant in teaching

227
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,808
sex-education in elementary school.

228
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,410
Aso-san...

229
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:09,482
I don't want to get pampered
by you, Aso-san!

230
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,384
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

231
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,020
I don't need that from you!

232
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,224
I wanted to actually do it,

233
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,928
with the pretext of it being a
reference for sex-education.

234
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,397
I'm a beast.

235
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,737
I wanted to do it.

236
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,577
Okay, shut up. Shut up.

237
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,097
Okay everyone,
take your seats.

238
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,339
So far...

239
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,010
in the health class,

240
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,381
we've learned about our
growing bodies.

241
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,384
Do you all remember
what you've learned?

242
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,655
As to how and when

243
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,922
we begin to develop...

244
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,358
It's different for

245
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,361
each and every one of us.

246
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,398
Okay. How do you read that?

247
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,266
- "Omoharuki."
- Wrong.

248
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,735
I know. It reads: "Choshinki."

249
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,839
Wrong again. The correct
reading is:

250
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,441
"Shi-..."

251
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,577
"shun-..."

252
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,446
"ki."

253
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,683
"Shishunki" (puberty). That's how
this is read.

254
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,987
We will now study about the
respective changes

255
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,057
boys and girls go through
during puberty.

256
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,393
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:03,730
It's not that I've forgotten
we're in mourning.

258
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,136
Look.

259
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,938
This was my mother's.

260
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,941
Don't tell Midori-san.

261
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,677
When you reach puberty,

262
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,379
with respect to appearance and
what's inside...

263
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,349
girls grow to become more womanly.

264
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,516
Mother?

265
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,452
I need to go to the restroom.

266
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh. Sure.

267
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,189
Okay.

268
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,324
Ouch!

269
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,894
Ouch.

270
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,267
And boys grow to
become more manly.

271
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,240
Chairman. Thank you for
everything today.

272
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,576
Thank you very much.

273
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,179
Um, uh...

274
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,615
this is a wedding, isn't it?

275
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,650
Where are the candles? The cake?

276
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,086
- Where's the champagne tower?
- For generations now,

277
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,522
we have done orthodox Japanese
Shinto ceremonies.

278
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,890
I never heard about this.

279
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,025
What is this, a Yakuza
naming ceremony?

280
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,395
Oh. Miyashita-san.

281
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,863
A Yakuza!

282
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,432
This is Akane-san's father.

283
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,733
This is...

284
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,202
the master of ceremony
for today, Yamaji-san.

285
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,370
How do you do?

286
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,006
This is my oldest son, Kazushige.

287
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,422
It was only till yesterday...

288
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,323
boys and girls rolled in mud...

289
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,592
and played together.

290
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,662
But the man and woman

291
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,230
start becoming aware

292
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,734
of each other,

293
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,936
as a person from the opposite
gender.

294
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,839
That's what puberty is.

295
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,408
It is a very natural thing.

296
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,944
And for the purpose of growing,

297
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,712
it is a necessary thing.

298
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,882
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

299
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,219
Congratulations.

300
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,856
Thank you very much.

301
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,858
Thank you very much.

302
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,233
Sorry.

303
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,803
I can't go to the divine
sanctum like this.

304
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,240
Boys become more manly.

305
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,578
Girls become more womanly.

306
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,380
Each follows his or her
respective path...

307
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,049
and becomes a grownup.

308
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,219
Because...

309
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,688
Akane-chan was the only one
that got hurt.

310
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,324
But I'm hurt even worse.

311
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,328
I don't want to pretend to have
the upper hand

312
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,729
over something that stupid.

313
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,299
I don't want Akane-chan to feel
bad over that.

314
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:55,969
Sorry...

315
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,472
In any case, I can't do this now.

316
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,008
- Bro.
- Masakazu, stop!

317
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,610
Masakazu!

318
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,745
Thank you.

319
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,781
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

320
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:09,716
Thank you very much.

321
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,485
Thank you for waiting.
Here is your chilled sake.

322
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,821
Thank you.

323
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,442
I'm not lying.

324
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,511
I'm getting ready to leave
for the business trip.

325
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,882
I didn't know how to get here,
I took a cab from the station.

326
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,656
- Hanakawa-san!
- Yes.

327
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,858
For 7.5 years at work,

328
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,861
I had always looked up to you.

329
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,231
Your rational judgment,
your passion for work.

330
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,900
Sometimes you were gentle,
sometimes you were harsh.

331
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,903
I am sincerely grateful

332
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,806
- for your mentorship.
- Yes.

333
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,475
Therefore...

334
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,181
- Let me punch you once.
- Yes. Huh?

335
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,056
Thank you very much!

336
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,593
Wait.

337
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,396
Wait!

338
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,699
Wait, Sakama-kun!

339
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,034
He ran away?

340
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,904
- This is the pamphelet...
- What is that?

341
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,806
- Was it Akane-chan?
- No, it wasn't.

342
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,341
It was Masakazu.

343
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,578
Hey, Aso-san, you're here too.

344
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,280
What? What's going on?

345
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,115
Sakama-san...

346
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,316
got cold feet.

347
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,151
Wait!

348
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,355
Seriously...

349
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,559
Wait up!

350
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,034
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

351
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,736
Thank you for waiting.

352
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,880
Welcome. May I take
your order?

353
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,190
Rice wine...

354
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,159
please.

355
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,068
What? What's going on?

356
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,738
Who knows! He suddenly dashed
off toward the station.

357
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,607
Huh?

358
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,509
Brides getting cold feet,

359
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,811
is something I've seen
in movies and what not...

360
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,814
but I've never heard of
grooms ditching.

361
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,482
What are we going to do?

362
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,618
The exchange of vows is
at 1:00 o'clock, isn't it?

363
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,886
Will it be canceled?

364
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,057
Of course, she can't get
married alone. Where's her dad?

365
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,360
Midori is distracting him right now,
it'll be a big fuss if he came here.

366
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,631
Madam. Hasn't the taxi
arrived yet?

367
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:15,868
Oh, sure. It should be
here soon, I think.

368
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,939
Ouch.
My stomach hurts.

369
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,641
Your stomach?

370
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,310
I have to go to the bathroom.

371
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,017
Akane-san!

372
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,424
Akane-chan!

373
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,826
What are you doing?

374
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,297
I'm doing it. I'm going to exchange
vows by myself.

375
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,365
You can't do it without a groom!

376
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,234
I can't give up
until I do it.

377
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,969
Give up?

378
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:54,807
I can be the groom's stand-in. I've
done it 4 times. I have experience.

379
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,309
Akane-chan!

380
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,245
Don't give up!

381
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:03,483
I will go find him and drag
him here!

382
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,153
Let's go!

383
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,223
During puberty,

384
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:15,695
hormones from the brain affect the
body to make various changes.

385
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,395
Okay, okay.

386
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:54,167
Women... become rounder.

387
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,702
And eventually, they begin
menstruation.

388
00:23:56,836 --> 00:24:00,273
Thank you for waiting. Here
is your chilled sake.

389
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:02,975
Ouch!

390
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,610
Sorry.

391
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:10,016
It is a preparation for having and
raising a baby.

392
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,352
Two drafts...

393
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,455
- Excuse me, one chilled sake.
- One chilled sake.

394
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,825
- One chilled sake.
- One chilled sake.

395
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,814
The probability of new life
being born is...

396
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,286
approximately one in
one-hundred million.

397
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:59,225
In other words, birth is mostly a
random event.

398
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:02,495
Hey customer. That is
a small plate.

399
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,996
Sorry. Sorry.

400
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,266
You have no manners for a
Japanese person.

401
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,734
Welcome.

402
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,103
And if that random
event didn't happen...

403
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,939
One draft.

404
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,575
An order of beef platter.

405
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,077
Everybody here...

406
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,814
would not exist in this world.

407
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,317
One beef platter. 330 yen.

408
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,952
Yuka-san.

409
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,420
You're Yuka-san.

410
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,155
I'm Sakama.
Maribu-kun's friend.

411
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:33,392
I'm Yoshida. Yoshida Yoshie,
a vocational student.

412
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,195
No, wait a second.

413
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,631
Let go! Power harassment!

414
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,833
No, no. I'm Maribu's...

415
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,737
- Store manager!
- This is not how it looks!

416
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,289
Yuka-chan!

417
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,490
Maribu!

418
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,326
The baby just fell asleep.

419
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,867
Sorry. I explained it, but...

420
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,269
I don't understand what
he's saying.

421
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,171
This guy is awkward.

422
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,107
Yuka-chan, why did you run away?

423
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,377
Because if you got arrested,
I would get arrested too.

424
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,778
Because I've overstayed.

425
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:29,215
But it's okay. We submitted a
birth report.

426
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,752
As long as we did that, you can get
a special staying permit.

427
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,187
In other words, you wouldn't
be sent back to China.

428
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,191
- Even if we're not married?
- Even if we're not married.

429
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,061
What in the world?

430
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,196
Japan is lenient.

431
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,237
I thought I'd feel better
if I punched him.

432
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,172
That superior at work.

433
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:57,410
But I felt even more powerless
after that.

434
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:03,215
First of all, that's the first time
I'd ever punched anybody.

435
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,952
It still hurts. Maybe I broke
a bone.

436
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,087
It's not broken.

437
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,791
At the same time, a part
of me feels turned off.

438
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,962
I've been thinking it through,

439
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,964
just like Akane-chan said.

440
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,100
As to what kind of attitude
I ought to take...

441
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,402
- Go hail a taxi.
- Huh?

442
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,937
Continue.

443
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,672
Anyway, I...

444
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,208
don't know how to
face Akane-chan right now.

445
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:37,216
Hey, what the...

446
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:43,255
Uh... we're passed the time, but...

447
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,025
please wait just a little longer.

448
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,030
What is this?
The groom isn't here...

449
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,398
there are very few friends...

450
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,100
the master of ceremonies
is a virgin...

451
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,435
Who else is coming?

452
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,537
Huh?

453
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,039
Hey.

454
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,307
It's you?

455
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,275
This is inexcusable.

456
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,312
My sister is a laughingstock!

457
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,615
I think Sakama-san
has backed out.

458
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,151
What? What the heck?

459
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,586
That's something I would do.

460
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:15,588
I am very sorry.

461
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:18,357
My family and workers
are looking for him as we speak.

462
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:22,795
We have not come here from Saga
to get shamed.

463
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,132
Madam. I had thought
the boy had character.

464
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:31,003
I had thought he speaks frankly,
in spite of how he looks.

465
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,373
However, my judgment
was an over-estimation.

466
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,308
Anyway, I am taking my
daughter home.

467
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,979
So... are we canceling?

468
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,748
Um, perhaps I should
tell everyone...

469
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:46,152
Sorry to bother you, but
something's going on.

470
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,787
The bride is receiving her
congratulatory wine.

471
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,122
Akane-chan?

472
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,492
The groom's not here,
what are you doing?

473
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:57,029
Knock it off, for crying out loud.
We heard everything you said.

474
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,998
So now...

475
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,834
we shall begin the
wedding ceremony...

476
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,604
of the Sakama and
Miyashita households.

477
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,608
Um... as the representative
of both families,

478
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,046
Father of the bride, Mr. Miyashita
Shigezo will address us.

479
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,584
On second thought, maybe he
shouldn't. The mother...

480
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:23,255
as you can see...

481
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,691
the groom, Masakuzu-kun,

482
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,860
is currently not
where he should be.

483
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,664
However,

484
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:34,400
do not worry! He will definitely
show up; for sure!

485
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,736
He's not, you know...

486
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,838
an irresponsible man.

487
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,543
Let's have a drink for now.

488
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,212
Then I will leave the

489
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,746
drinking lead up to Nogami-san.

490
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,816
All right, Nogami!

491
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,192
Draw it out.
Draw it out as long as you can.

492
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,293
Sure, sure.

493
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,496
That's a tall order.

494
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,399
Well...

495
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,437
the skirts of women,
and speeches...

496
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,007
ought to be short; so they say,
so cheers.

497
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,276
Cheers.

498
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:23,249
Maribu. Seriously.
What the...

499
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:25,618
Store manager!

500
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:29,288
Long time no see!
The groom has arrived!

501
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,459
Masakazu! How could you
be so foolish?

502
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,961
Hey, all of you.
Leave the hall for now!

503
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,229
What is this?

504
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,865
You dare crash my daughter's
precious wedding?

505
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,701
It's her precious wedding, that's
why I'm telling you to step out.

506
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:45,104
The two of them need to talk.

507
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,206
Hurry up! Don't just sit there,
scoot!

508
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,708
Or maybe the two of them
should step outside.

509
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,278
Yama-chan.

510
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:53,479
You're smart.

511
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,215
- Okay ugly, step outside.
- You mustn't say 'ugly,' Maribu.

512
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,284
I...

513
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,859
I want to marry Masakazu-san!

514
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,497
I have never been
more embarassed...

515
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,701
more sad...

516
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:19,605
more angry...

517
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,309
more forlorn...

518
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,879
in my entire life.

519
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,115
And yet,

520
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:32,985
I didn't...

521
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:39,525
I didn't leave my spot,
I endured, because...

522
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,294
I want to be...

523
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,366
Masakazu's...

524
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,605
the Sakama family's...

525
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,308
bride.

526
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,278
Don't cry, ugly.

527
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,580
- Your makeup will run.
- Maribu-kun.

528
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,282
I was taking marriage lightly.

529
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,490
I don't ever want to
feel like this again.

530
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:20,232
If I cannot marry Masakazu...

531
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,069
I vow to be single the
rest of my life.

532
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,945
I don't ever want to go
through this ever again.

533
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,682
If it weren't you, Akane-chan...

534
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,853
I could've never come this far.
I wouldn't have done it.

535
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:54,733
Me too...

536
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,337
I vow that I will never marry

537
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,073
anyone but you.

538
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,393
My legs are cramped.

539
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:50,989
Get this thing off me!

540
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:59,131
Erm...

541
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:03,268
The sealing kiss! Wait that's
a different kind of ceremony.

542
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,738
The exchanging of rings.
The rings...

543
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,672
Congratulations!

544
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:30,622
So...

545
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:36,261
is there such thing as a
perfect grownup?

546
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,597
I wonder about that.

547
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,303
For example, I am turning
thirty next year.

548
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,241
To all of you, thirty years old
sounds like a real grownup's age.

549
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,175
However,

550
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,277
twenty years from now...

551
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,015
Twenty years from now,
for all of you...

552
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,052
When you all turn
thirty years old,

553
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,621
you will surely
think the this:

554
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,828
"I am still such a child."

555
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,265
"So this is how Yamaji was?"

556
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,467
"I have no girlfriend."

557
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:19,738
"I hate my job. I'm still a virgin.
I'm like Yamaji!"

558
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,173
Yamaji has gone berserk.

559
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,075
Now all of your moms
and dads...

560
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,244
are they perfect grownups?

561
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,447
They oversleep sometimes,
don't they?

562
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,283
They get drunk and argue, don't
they? They rip farts, don't they?

563
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,253
Different from the body...

564
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,924
the puberty of one's mind...

565
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,128
will continue as long
as you live.

566
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,364
Therefore...

567
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,134
grownups make mistakes too.

568
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,006
They get lazy. They run away.
They lose their way.

569
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,540
It's a dead end, isn't it?

570
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,610
This place is
totally confusing.

571
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,446
They make excuses.
They blame others.

572
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,682
They fall in love with people
they shouldn't fall in love with.

573
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,887
It's all because of puberty.

574
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,455
Okay!

575
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:12,324
Here goes.

576
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,326
I'm here now.
Thank you very much.

577
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:18,263
I'm sorry. I got lost
along the way.

578
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,366
Hey there...

579
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,203
You're here, Sakama-san!

580
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,673
Never mind that, just get
into the picture.

581
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,573
Please.

582
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,642
I see.

583
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,679
- Sorry about that.
- Okay, here goes.

584
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:34,613
Okay.

585
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,283
Grownups make mistakes too.

586
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,653
They can't help it.

587
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:42,587
So...

588
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,293
please become a grownup

589
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:54,866
who can forgive others' mistakes.

590
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,637
That said,

591
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,507
we conclude the
sex-education class.

592
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,475
Rise.

593
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:09,514
Bow.

594
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,085
Let's play, Yamaji.

595
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:19,424
Let's play.

596
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,461
The mackerel is cooked.

597
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,162
Okay.

598
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,865
Mackerel...

599
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:29,868
Okay.

600
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,872
Akane-chan, please go
wake Yutori up.

601
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:34,806
Okay.

602
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,876
Yutori-chan.

603
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,745
Get up.

604
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,747
You're starting work
next month, aren't you?

605
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,915
Okay.

606
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,351
Good morning.

607
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,653
Good morning. How are you?

608
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,158
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

609
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,328
Akane-chan, tie my tie for me,
I can't remember how.

610
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,497
I haven't seen you in a
suit in a long time.

611
00:39:58,964 --> 00:39:59,831
Start.

612
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,009
All right, I got this.

613
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:13,278
- I know all of it!
- Be seated!

614
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,246
Okay.

615
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:20,085
Business manager... eh?

616
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,087
I brought my company's
newest product today.

617
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,364
Could you add this to the
inventory in all the

618
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,698
Tori-no-tami store across
the country?

619
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,534
"Millennial People"?

620
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,003
You added one character and
made it look like a collaboration!

621
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,338
Are you talking about an
exclusive contract?

622
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:42,707
Is that so?

623
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,177
Yes.

624
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,379
Please give it a try.

625
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,048
What is this... this is a
little too aggressive.

626
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,216
Yamagishi.

627
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,254
I shall test it out.

628
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:00,725
Okay.

629
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:04,930
I have written it.

630
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,434
And this one too, please.

631
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,469
Why is it me? I mean I can, but...

632
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,871
Thank you very much.

633
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,842
Even if our wedding anniversaries
are the same...

634
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,877
we're still not friends.

635
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,779
I'm a witness he said that.

636
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,581
Can this guy do it?

637
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,716
- He's a virgin, isn't he?
- That shouldn't matter.

638
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,418
Anybody want a refill?

639
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:30,288
The ever popular "Millennial People"
is available at a bargain price.

640
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:34,826
Yay, this is our sake. For
millennials only.

641
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,428
I can't drink anymore.

642
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:37,329
I will.

643
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:42,968
Oh yeah, look at this.

644
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:00,785
"Certificate of passing law exam:
law dept., Michigami Maribu"

645
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,956
It took me eleven years,

646
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,259
and I can only go to a university
that would actually let me in.

647
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:11,263
So you're a college student starting
spring, in spite of how you look.

648
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,765
I'll be job hunting soon enough.

649
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,966
How's your sister?

650
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,835
Yeah.

651
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:18,169
She's doing fine.

652
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:22,073
When you talk of Maui,
you're talking sunsets.

653
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,747
A nice offshore breeze was blowing
the last time I went there,

654
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,717
and the northshore and sideshore
were both totally attractive.

655
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:33,752
Lots of temptations.

656
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:38,256
So this one here, it's
"Four Seasons"?

657
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:41,793
I'm sorry.

658
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,829
I don't understand a
word you're saying.

659
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:51,069
Guess who came for the teaching
internship this year?

660
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,512
After all the bad attitude he'd
shown...

661
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,214
what the cheek!

662
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,583
But he acts as if nothing
had happened.

663
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:06,918
Looking very forward.

664
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,421
He's a true millennial.

665
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:12,157
I tried to focus more energy
on my business, so

666
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,259
I gave a hiring tests, but...

667
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,928
Don't tell me...

668
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:22,300
So your hobby is wine tasting.

669
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:28,406
Yes, my dream is to go to
wineries in all 47 prefectures.

670
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,679
Is the baby coming,
Midori-san?

671
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,881
- I think it's coming.
- What?

672
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:39,451
- I'll go get my brother.
- I'll call an ambulance.

673
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:41,953
- Ouch.
- I am...

674
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,255
a feminist, so...

675
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,327
That's a true millennial.

676
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,263
So, did your sister
have her baby?

677
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:55,600
It's a boy. He's so cute!

678
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,702
Sorry to bother you,

679
00:43:57,836 --> 00:44:00,305
- but we're closing shop.
- How much do we owe?

680
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:01,406
I'll pay.

681
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,743
- Come on, witness to the wedding.
- No, really.

682
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,277
I only have 3,000 yen.

683
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:10,749
- Then let's split the bill...
- The tab has already been paid!

684
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:13,251
Good night! Let's
drink together again.

685
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,226
What the heck...
show off.

686
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,696
Thank you for waiting.

687
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,469
Um... I'm going home.

688
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:32,837
Really?

689
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,173
- Excuse me.
- Is that so?

690
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:38,543
Be happy.

691
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,846
- You too.
- I will.

692
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,918
See you.

693
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:47,852
See you.

694
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:56,428
Let's get going.

695
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,263
Let's help out with the washing.

696
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,402
- Here.
- Here.

697
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,040
I'll hold that.

698
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:10,208
This too?

699
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,510
Take this too?

700
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,179
Alright.

701
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:22,253
"We're Millennials. Got a Problem?
'Millennial People'"

702
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,090
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

703
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,426
Excuse me.
