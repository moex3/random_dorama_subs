1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,580
What's going on here?

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,670
This is the labyrinth ARIBISU.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,990
There's a Gate of Destruction somewhere in here.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,580
Staying here won't solve anything.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,020
Let's go ahead.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,730
what is this?

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,940
KOYORI.

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,050

let's go.

SOUMA.

11
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,860
RYUGA, what's wrong?

12
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,010
what is this?

13
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,450
The layout of the walls here is different from when I passed by earlier.

14
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,990
I think the walls are moving and the path is changing.

32
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,330
What did you think after cutting HORROR yesterday?

33
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,750
There were times when my father would make the same face as you after he killed a HORROR.

34
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,750
It's an expression that seems to be mourning the HORROR that was killed.

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,540
I thought that the Makai Knight should be strong.

36
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,590
There's something I'm missing.

37
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,470
Let me tell you GODOU's words.

38
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,700
You are KOUZAN KNIGHT ZANGO.

39
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,940
GODOU.

40
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A customer is waiting for you.

41
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,720
who are you?

42
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,890
I am Ryuuga Dogai.

43
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,830
Are you a Golden Knight?

44
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,810
I'm GODOU.

45
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,310
nice to meet you.

46
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,380
By the way, why is the Golden Knight here?

47
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,060
I came here to retrain myself.

48
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,440
Have you ever wanted to become stronger?

49
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,110
The Golden Knight is still on the road to finding strength.

50
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,280
What special move did you use to kill HORROR?

51
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,680
That technique is the SENKOUKENBU.

52
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,920
Please teach me the SENKOUKENBU.

53
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,440
That special move is not something that can be taught easily.

54
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,790
The secret of SENKOUKENBU is to use the darkness to acquire a stronger light.

55
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,840
SENKOUKENBU is a sword of light.

56
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,750
If you don't have the heart to overcome the darkness, you will be eroded by the darkness and lose your sense of self.

57
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,570
I will overcome the darkness, I have overcome the trials of darkness.

58
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,150
If you have conquered the darkness, you will be able to learn the SENKOUKENBU.

59
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,600
GODOU, please teach me that special move.

60
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,640
I understand, you can follow me.

61
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,579
what is this?

62
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,660
I traveled all over the place to solve the mystery of the Gate of Destruction.

63
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,100
This is one of the pieces I got there.

64
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:06,370
The first step in SENKOUKENBU is to connect with SOUL METAL through heart-to-heart communication.

65
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,540
Please control the evil spirit that resides in the sword.

66
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,870
RYUGA, please turn darkness into light.

67
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,720
This is exactly what I thought.

68
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
you have the talent.

69
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:12,360
RYUGA, please concentrate your mind and put your feelings into the light.

70
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,520
let's start.

71
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,230
RYUGA, you are amazing.

72
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,140
It's a great SENKOUKENBU.

73
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,040
My armor suddenly disappeared.

74
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,300
SENKOUKENBU involves heavy damage to the mind and body.

75
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,800
Loaded armor will be forced back to avoid damage.

76
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,140
Everyone starts out like you.

77
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,540
You'll get used to it eventually.

78
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,310
RYUGA.

79
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,340
SENKOUKENBU has a pair of special moves.

80
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,350
It turns light into jet-black darkness, and its special move is a sword of darkness that covers that darkness.

81
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,530
Do those who use its skills wear darkness?

82
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,300
The name of his special move is SENEIKENBU.

83
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,510
SENEIKENBU.

84
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,270
SENKOUKENBU and SENEIKENBU are closely connected.

85
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:34,090
Since you have overcome the trials of darkness, you will definitely be able to master SENEIKENBU someday.

86
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,110
You keep training and don't slack off.

87
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,050
I understand.

88
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,980
I taught the Golden Knight the SENKOUKENBU before my son.

89
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,310
do you have a son?

90
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,210
My son is competitive and it's hard for me.

91
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,600
It's hard to take care of my son.

92
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,110
I don't seem to think you're having a hard time.

93
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,320
Does it seem like that to you?

94
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,950
I guess every father is like that.

95
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,890
I understand.

96
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,770
RYUGA.

97
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,080
For me, my son and GARO are the same.

98
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,490
It means hope, right?

99
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,360
That's hope.

100
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,180
My son is my hope.

101
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,740
Thank you for teaching me special techniques.

102
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,270
Please use SENKOUKENBU after assessing the battle situation.

103
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,140
I will train and master the SENKOUKENBU.

104
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm encouraged by you.

105
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:27,610
I will teach my son SENKOUKENBU someday.

106
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,100
Your son will become a fine Makai Realm Knight like you.

107
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,380
RYUGA.

108
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,880
When you meet my son, I will entrust him to you.

109
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,070
GODOU was planning to teach you the SENKOUKENBU.

110
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,640
GODOU was thinking.

111
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,580
GODOU was hesitant about teaching you techniques.

112
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,240
It was no surprise that he was hesitant about teaching me special moves.

113
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,720
SOUMA.

114
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,190
Keep your willpower strong.

115
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,020
SOUMA, please return your consciousness to normal.

116
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,530
I'm a failure.

117
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,310
All phenomena exist at the origin.

118
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,360
GODOU taught me these words, saying, ``Please remember these words when you are lost.''

119
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,960
How about thinking back to when you decided to become a knight?

120
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,480
You may find what you are missing.

121
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,750
origin.

122
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,870
SOUMA.

123
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,380
KOYORI.

124
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,190
How do you know this place?

125
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,260
This is all thanks to MUTSUGI.

126
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,440
Everyone please hurry.

127
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,220
wait a minute.

128
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,480
KOYORI.

129
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,890
What are the words carved on the stone monument?

130
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:21,449
A person with light desires blood, not the end.

131
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,150
All phenomena have their origin.

132
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,050
A person with light desires blood, not the end.

133
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,620
I now know how to get to the Gate of Destruction.

134
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,660
The words "without seeking an end" written on the stone monument may refer to the place of the beginning.

135
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,030
"It wants blood."

136
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,620
This is the answer.

137
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
what is this?

138
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,270
This is the entrance to the Gate of Destruction.

139
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,990
let's go.

140
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,390
be careful!

141
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,220
KOYORI.

142
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,840
Let's go ahead.

145
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,620
Don't forget what you came here for.

146
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,300
That is the Gate of Destruction.

147
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,740
No way.

148
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,150
That's true?

149
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,950
That's my father.

150
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,260
No way.
