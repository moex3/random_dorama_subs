1
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,550
This is a gate.

2
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,550
That is the Gate of Destruction.

3
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,470
Is this really that?

4
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,040
That can't be true.

5
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,040
GODOU!

6
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,430
SOUMA.

7
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,820

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,180
He is MASATO HAGIWARA.

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,910
That is HIRONOBU KAGEYAMA.

19
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,029
The producers are Higa Ichiro and SYUHEI OKABAYASHI.

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,620
The script was written by YOSHIKATSU KODAMA, and the script was assisted by YOSHIKATSU KIMURA.

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,620
The opening song is GARO：Heir To Steel Armor WITH JAM PROJECT.

22
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,900
Composed and arranged by YUKI KAJIURA.

23
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,640
The music producer is SYUNJI INOUE.

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,910
They are YOSHICHIKA KURIYAMA and SHIHO TERADA.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
They are cinematography, lighting, sound recording, art, editing, and VFX supervisors.

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
The costumes were made by YOU-KO, and the magic tools and magic swords were made by NOBORU KAWAKAMI.

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,150
Special modeling is by AKITERU NAKATA, and HORROR design is supervised by JIRO.

28
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,640
The action director is MASAKI SUGIMURA.

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,000
The director is YOSHIKATSU KIMURA.

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,910
Did MUTSUGI make us come here on purpose?

31
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,620
It was just a moment.

32
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,540
I saw it.

33
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,680
What is this?

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,640
This is the entrance to the Gate of Destruction.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,750
let's go.

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,580
What is it for?

37
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,740
I don't understand that either.

38
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,320
I have something to worry about.

39
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,910
That was when RYUGA and SOUMA were sent flying in the beginning.

40
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,570
MUTSUGI seemed to know where SOUMA was going.

41
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,840
He followed the magic circle and found them.

42
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,830
Maybe that's the case.

43
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,420
When I fought the horde of HORROR, I heard GODOU's voice.

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,490
I finally understood it.

45
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,990
It is the night of dawn that comes once every three years.

46
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,420
This is the first step towards opening that path.

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,320
I'm going to the One-Eyed Forest.

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,510
GODOU had told someone that he was going to the One-Eyed Forest.

49
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,550
That was 3 years ago.

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,220
GODOU probably came here with MUTSUGI.

51
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,699
What is MUTSUGI's purpose?

52
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,180
let us hurry.

53
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,450
SOUMA, you don't have to resist.

54
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,000
Surrender yourself to darkness.

55
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,820
why did you do this?

56
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,210
Of course it's for justice.

57
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,770
All we need is for you to undo ZANGO's armor.

58
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,780
My wish will come true.

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,490
I was finally able to come back here.

60
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,140
SOUMA.

61
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,260
Have you ever imagined a world without HORROR?

62
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,600
That is when the seal on the Gate of Destruction is broken.

63
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,220
We can create such an ideal world.

64
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,050
Grudge prevents people from becoming unhappy.

65
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,890
I saved a man from HORROR.

66
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,520
As a makai order, I did what was expected of me.

67
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,680
But then the man took the lives of many people.

68
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,870
You still can't forget it?

69
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,630
I should have told you this.

70
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,510
You shouldn't go through it alone.

71
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,320
But it's my fault.

72
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,660
I wish I hadn't saved that guy from HORROR.

73
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,920
The makai order's mission is simply to protect people from HORROR.

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,250
We cannot predict that the person we helped will later commit a crime.

75
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,940
I fully understand that.

76
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,660
That's if the same thing happens again.

77
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,740
All I can do is watch it in silence?

78
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,430
Is there any point in saving a murderer?

79
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,940
It's the same as how we miss out on HORROR.

80
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,740
sorry.

81
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,000
MUTSUGI!

82
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,590
Let us believe in humans.

83
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,590
As long as you don't lose hope, a path will always open.

84
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,540
I'll look into the Gate of Destruction a little more.

85
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,300
The Gate of Destruction is called the oldest gate.

86
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,680
That's when the gate was opened.

87
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,240
The human world has become a world where HORROR is rampant.

88
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,070
Our ancestors made many sacrifices to seal that gate.

89
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,310
However, even now, this world is full of Grudge.

90
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,610
People don't change anything.

91
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,760
That will continue forever.

92
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,530
Can't I continue to make the world free of Grudge?

93
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,200
I tried every possible way.

94
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,830
And then I arrived at the existence of the forbidden fruit.

95
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,520
MUTSUGI!

96
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,090
Finally I understood.

97
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,130
The night of dawn, which occurs once every three years, will be the first step towards opening that path.

98
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm going to the One-Eyed Forest.

99
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
There is a stone of everlasting darkness.

100
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,340
I'm going there too! no!

101
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,330
I'll go there alone.

102
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,350
Why!

103
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,230
That forest is a place where you never know what will happen.

104
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,940
What will happen to this town if we both can't return?

105
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,850
That's right.

106
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,070
you don't have to worry.

107
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,490
hang on!

108
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,810
MUTSUGI!

109
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,410
My knowledge will be useful in ABYSS.

110
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,260
Let me go there with you too!

111
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,350
This is the Gate of Destruction.

112
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,920
MUTSUGI!

113
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,810
Move forward.

114
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,360
Those who seek justice!

115
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,400
When you break this seal, your deepest desires will come true.

116
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,820
Follow your heart.

117
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,790
I'm sure you know what that means.

118
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,620
This was here!

119
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,460
MUTSUGI!

120
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,960
This was here!

121
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,680
This was here!

122
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,500
Anyone who eats it will be given omnipotent power.

123
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,850
This is the forbidden fruit.

124
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,980
It's inside this gate.

125
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,320
what are you saying?

126
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,580
We can obtain the forbidden fruit.

127
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,199
A world without HORROR will be realized.

128
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,900
GODOU!

129
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,580
Let us open the Gate of Destruction now!

130
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,380
Don't be stupid!

131
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,520
You know what to expect when you open the gate.

132
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,590
That's convenient.

133
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,990
If the gate opens, I can gather people with Grudge at once.

134
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,380
what do you do after that?

135
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,310
I'll kill them.

136
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,490
They are people who will eventually turn into HORROR.

137
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,900
I will drive them out first.

138
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,220
What's wrong with that?

139
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,500
If you have the forbidden fruit, you can do it.

140
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,510
True peace will come.

141
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,850
Utsugi, calm down.

142
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,180
You are strange now.

143
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,100
It's you who's weird.

144
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,690
MUTSUGI! Wait!

145
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,860
I won't let you have your way.

146
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,650
Zansae!

147
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,100
MUTSUGI! Stop it!

148
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
Don't get in my way!

149
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,260
GODOU, the seal on the Gate of Destruction is broken.

150
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,440
It will finally come true.

151
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,850
GODOU, what are you going to do?

152
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,860
That's natural.

153
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,500
Please return the armor.

154
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,820
At this rate, you will be eaten by the armor.

155
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,820
Even if this body perishes, I must prevent this opening.

156
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,500
GODOU, the seal on the Gate of Destruction is broken.

157
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,780
Finally it will happen.

158
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,560
GODOU, what are you going to do?

159
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,650
That's natural.

160
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,090
Please return the armor.

161
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,810
At this rate, you will be eaten by the armor.

162
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:23,070
Even if this body perishes, I must prevent this opening.

163
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,860
GODOU!

164
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,140
ZANGO's armor quickly absorbed the evil energy of the Gate of Destruction.

165
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,520
The armor descended, still holding the gate.

166
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,989
This was three years ago.

167
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,410
GODOU, did this happen because of you?

168
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,030
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

But that was unavoidable.

170
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,050
Because GODOU rejected a peaceful world.

171
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,730
Do not be silly!

172
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,870
I want you to make a different decision than GODOU.

173
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,620
It also means making your wishes come true.

what is your wish?

175
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,200
Is it to protect people by wearing the same ZANGO armor as GODOU?

176
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,120
Do you want to be recognized by GODOU?

177
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,580
If we open the seal on the Gate of Destruction, we can protect many people.

178
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,100
If that happens, GODOU will definitely recognize you.

179
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,200
shut up!

180
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,740
SOUMA, undo your armor!

181
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,730
