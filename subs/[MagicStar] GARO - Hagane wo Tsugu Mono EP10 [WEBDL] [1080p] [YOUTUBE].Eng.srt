00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,240
This is the Gate of Destruction.

MUTSUGI.

3
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:46,780
There was a forbidden fruit that granted omniscience and omnipotence to those who ate it.

4
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,060
It's inside the gate.

5
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,680
what are you saying?

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,860
You can get the forbidden fruit.

7
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,910
A world without HORROR will be realized.

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,150
GODOU, open the Gate of Destruction now.

9
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,020
You don't say anything stupid.

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,140
You know what will happen when you open the gate.

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,390
GODOU, the seal on the Gate of Destruction is broken.

12
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,520
What is GODOU planning to do?

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,890
I do the right thing.

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,670
You will be cursed if you continue like this.

15
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,600
Even if this body perishes, this gate must not be opened.

16
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,700

What did you do to SOUMA?

37
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,930
SOUMA.

38
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,320
SOUMA.

39
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,380
I take on armor to protect the world.

40
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,470
SOUMA.

41
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,790
Deception.

42
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,030
SOUMA.

43
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,500
RYUGA, don't get in my way.

44
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,830
you.

45
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,510
I have no grudge against RYUGA.

46
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,110
KOYORI.

47
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,900
Please, please stop.

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,740
You don't get in the way.

49
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,590
Your opponent is me.

50
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,700
SOUMA.

51
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,650
What did you come for?

52
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,400
what?

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,370
I have no use for you.

54
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,450
It hurts here.

55
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,380
After all, you are just like us.

56
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,160
You're also just a HAGANE, right?

57
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,230
What do you know?

58
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,110
SOUMA, please show me more of your Grudge.

59
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,170
SOUMA.

60
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,830
KOYORI.

61
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,940
There's no way SOUMA can surpass GODOU.

62
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,500
In the first place, SOUMA cannot even catch up with GODOU.

63
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,060
You don't fool around.

64
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,260
Don't be SOUMA by that.

65
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,820
GODOU.

66
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,970
RYUGA, my son is GARO.

67
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,570
what?

68
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,470
That means hope, right?

69
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,960
Hope.

70
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Yes, that's hope.

71
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,370
I won't let your hope die here.

72
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,000
How long are you going to defy me?

73
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,880
That is until you return to the original MUTSUGI.

74
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,709
I believed that KOYORI would understand.

75
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,180
It's coming soon.

76
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,330
You responded well.

77
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,130
Don't look down on me.

78
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,660
That's true.

79
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,960
You were my disciple.

80
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,840
I have come this far because of you.

81
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,460
Are you okay?

82
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:39,520
I know your kindness and love for people more than anyone else, and your dedication to helping others.

83
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,600
Why then do you try to open the Gate of Destruction?

84
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,660
makai order like us exist to protect people from HORROR.

85
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,920
I have always believed that it means peace.

86
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,950
But what about the reality?

87
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,510
Exterminating the HORROR will not lead to true peace.

88
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,680
There are people with bad hearts who are not yet possessed by HORROR.

89
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,750
Because these people commit crimes, there is no end to the victims.

90
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,640
We should look to the future and eradicate such people.

91
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,580
Doing that won't solve anything.

92
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:01,220
Isn't it our mission as makai order to believe in humans and fight?

93
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,630
That's crazy.

94
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,990
my father.

95
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,220
what?

96
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,760
That's what I thought.

97
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,060
Do you think you are strong with that level of strength?

98
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,640
Please don't think that I will always be the same.

99
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,960
You don't get emotional.

100
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,570
You haven't changed in this way.

101
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,660
If you misunderstand GODOU and me, then you should fight me.

102
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,390
You overcome the darkness.

103
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,070
are you in pain?

104
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,230
The answer lies ahead.

105
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,120
MUTSUGI.

106
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,909
you are wrong.

107
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,510
GARO.

108
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,080
HAGANE.

109
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,850
MUTSUGI.

110
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,570
you are wrong.

111
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,660
This is already good, right?

112
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,860
I don't need to continue this futile battle with you any longer.

113
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,250
SOUMA.

114
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,740
MUTSUGI is right.

115
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,940
Please follow what MUTSUGI says.

116
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,950
Is MUTSUGI correct?

117
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,470
The answer you seek lies within that suffering.

118
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,340
You overcome the darkness.

119
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,850
I am a makai order.

120
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
I don't care if it costs me my life.

121
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,400
I won't do what you want now.

122
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,610
You overcome the darkness.

123
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,140
The only thing you have to overcome is yourself.

124
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,090
SOUMA, what you have to overcome is yourself.

125
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,360
Be strong in your heart.

126
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,160
SOUMA please come back.

127
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,140
You overcome the darkness.

128
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,640
You are HAGANE.

129
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,420
Together with me, you can change this world.

130
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,640
I refuse it.

131
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,970
Is that so?

132
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,870
It seems you didn't understand what I said.

133
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,200
Your actions end there.

134
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,580
SOUMA.

135
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,640
I overcame the darkness.

136
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:18,180
A wandering heart that struggles alone will melt into an AMBITIOUS city.

137
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,120
The soul breaks and scatters.

138
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:43,120
As the moonlight laughs, he says he can't save her and opens the gate.

139
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,210
The sky is blurring white now.

140
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,210
Wings soar through the darkness.

141
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,340
BREAK THROUGH You can soar.

142
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,290
It is a SWORD DANCE of darkness and light.

143
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:16,870
SIN MY FAITH until the day the evil desires disappear.

144
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,510
This story is a fiction.

145
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,000
This story has nothing to do with any real people, organizations, or incidents.

146
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,030
The Gate of Destruction will return to its original form.

147
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,190
This is his aim.

148
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,070
The world you seek is not a utopia.

149
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,110
Temptation.
