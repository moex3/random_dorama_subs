you··.

5
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,630
The heart of this woman who despaired over her unrewarding mission...

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,010
And due to her obsession with wishing for a world without Grudge...

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,380
The Gate of Destruction have awakened.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,689
You guys lose.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,600
The human world will once again become a world of chaos.

10
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,980
No way.

11

Let's join forces and fight.

34
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,730
let's go.

35
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,740
Okay.

36
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,890
SOUMA.

37
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
RYUGA.

38
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,680
SOUMA.

39
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,520
Disappear, the light of hope that illuminates the darkness.

40
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,040
RYUGA, if you remain in this state, you will be consumed by evil.

41
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,250
RYUGA.

42
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,660
Try turning darkness into light.

43
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,290
SENKOUKENBU and SENEIKENBU are two sides of the same coin.

44
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,610
You have overcome the trials of darkness, so you are sure to master it someday.

45
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,930
I will transform all of GARO's golden light into the power of darkness.

46
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,920
what?

47
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,620
Return to darkness.

48
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,320
RYUGA.

49
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,340
SOUMA.

50
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,090
RYUGA slashed the HORROR.

51
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,560
RYUGA.

52
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,910
You freed MUTSUGI from HORROR.

53
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,010
thank you.

54
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,150
We now have to do something about the Gate of Destruction.

55
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,240
The dragon's head held by the Gate of Destruction is a HORROR used by our ancestors to seal the gate.

56
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,410
It has awakened from a long slumber and is seeking the souls of people.

57
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,280
In that state, we can't get close to it.

58
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,020
SOUMA.

59
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,030
There is a way.

60
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,460
It's a SENKOUKENBU.

61
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,810
I've never succeeded in that trick.

62
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,440
GODOU believed that you could master the SENKOUKENBU.

63
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,450
It is true that you were swallowed up by darkness that day.

64
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,870
However, GODOU said:

65
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,460
It was impossible for SOUMA to do that.

66
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,330
No, it's the opposite.

67
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,820
He heard my voice and came back from the darkness of his own free will.

68
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,430
If he improves himself from now on, he will definitely be able to overcome the darkness.

69
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,500
After all, SOUMA is a suitable successor to ZANGO.

70
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,820
Did my father say that?

71
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,510
SOUMA.

72
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,770
believe in yourself.

73
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,070
I believe in you too.

74
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,820
SOUMA.

75
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,840
You can do that, right?

76
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,540
I'll do it.

77
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,890
RYUGA, you need to be purified before you can wear the armor.

78
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,910
What is that?

79
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,960
This is the sword that Igus had.

80
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:51,000
Someday, please inherit the will of my friend GODOU.

81
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,000
Igus.

82
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's fight together.

83
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,140
Igus will also help you.

84
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,220
Okay.

85
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,510
SOUMA.

86
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,520
let's go.

87
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,530
Okay.

88
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,980
Accept your own darkness.

89
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,380
And turn that into light, SOUMA.

90
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,450
I accept my own darkness.

91
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,390
And I turn it into light.

92
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,020
Believe in yourself.

93
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,360
Put your thoughts as a makai order into it.

94
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,940
Get over it, SOUMA.

95
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,930
now.

96
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,190
You did it.

97
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,640
RYUGA.

98
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,870
That was a wonderful SENKOUKENBU.

99
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,640
If GODOU saw us now, he would recognize our abilities.

100
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,020
SOUMA.

101
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,510
What happened to the Gate of Destruction?

102
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,970
Our ancestors must have realized this through great sacrifice.

103
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,570
It is simply impossible to destroy the Gate of Destruction.

104
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,070
This world has light and darkness.

105
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,330
Similarly, they chose to coexist with the Gate of Destruction.

106
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,560
RYUGA.

107
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,870
I think I understand what you said.

108
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,570
Until now, I had thought that as long as I lived, all I had to do was kill HORROR.

109
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,760
But I was wrong.

110
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,870
That's right.

111
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,490
That alone will not lead to the future.

112
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,250
This is what we can do.

113
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,010
As makai order, we must pass on the heart of HAGANE to future generations.

114
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,589
That's right, RYUGA.

115
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,060
Are you leaving now?

116
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,520
yes.

117
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,190
I have to purify GARO's armor as soon as possible.

118
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,310
Besides, there are a splendid Makai Priests and three swordsmen here.

119
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,250
We will pass it on to the future.

120
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,090
My father and their thoughts.

121
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,640
because··.

122
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,010
